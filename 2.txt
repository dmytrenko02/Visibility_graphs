010       Information, disturbance and Hamiltonian quantum feedback control
021       We consider separating the problem of designing Hamiltonian quantum feedback control algorithms into a measurement (estimation) strategy and a feedback (control) strategy, and consider optimizing desirable properties of each under the minimal constraint that the available strength of both is limited. 
020       This motivates concepts of information extraction and disturbance which are distinct from those usually considered in quantum information theory. Using these concepts we identify an information trade-off in quantum feedback control.

010       Information extraction and quantum state distortions in continuous   variable quantum teleportation
021       We analyze the loss of fidelity in continuous variable teleportation due to non-maximal entanglement. 
020       It is shown that the quantum state distortions correspond to the measurement back-action of a field amplitude measurement. Results for coherent states and for photon number states are presented.
