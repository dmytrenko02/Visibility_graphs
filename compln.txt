010       Error and attack tolerance of complex networks
021       Many complex systems, such as communication networks, display a surprising degree of robustness: while key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. 
020       The stability of these complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. In this paper we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems, but it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks. We find that scale-free networks, describing a number of systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks or a cell, display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.

010       The large-scale organization of metabolic networks
021       In a cell or microorganism the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer, and cell fate specification are seamlessly integrated through a complex network of various cellular constituents and reactions. 
020       However, despite the key role these networks play in sustaining various cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present the first systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variances in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks display the same topologic scaling properties demonstrating striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This suggests that the metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.

010       Bose-Einstein condensation in complex networks
021       The evolution of many complex systems, including the world wide web, business and citation networks is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the system's constituents. 
020       Despite their irreversible and non-equilibrium nature these networks follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Addressing the dynamical properties of these non-equilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the 'first-mover-advantage', 'fit-get-rich' and 'winner-takes-all' phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks.

010       Epidemic dynamics and endemic states in complex networks
021       We study by analytical methods and large scale simulations a dynamical model for the spreading of epidemics in complex networks. 
020       In networks with exponentially bounded connectivity we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a threshold defining a critical point below which the infection prevalence is null. On the contrary, on a wide range of scale-free networks we observe the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior. This implies that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading and the persistence of infections whatever spreading rate the epidemic agents might possess. These results can help understanding computer virus epidemics and other spreading phenomena on communication and social networks.

010       Spectra of "Real-World" Graphs: Beyond the Semi-Circle Law
021       Many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. 
020       The eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. While the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the Internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. An important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. Making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. We find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. Furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. In particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. These and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks.

010       A Price Dynamics in Bandwidth Markets for Point-to-point Connections
021       We simulate a network of N routers and M network users making concurrent point-to-point connections by buying and selling router capacity from each other. 
020       The resources need to be acquired in complete sets, but there is only one spot market for each router. In order to describe the internal dynamics of the market, we model the observed prices by N-dimensional Ito-processes. Modeling using stochastic processes is novel in this context of describing interactions between end-users in a system with shared resources, and allows a standard set of mathematical tools to be applied. The derived models can also be used to price contingent claims on network capacity and thus to price complex network services such as quality of service levels, multicast, etc.

010       Measuring preferential attachment for evolving networks
021       A key ingredient of current models proposed to capture the topological evolution of complex networks is the hypothesis that highly connected nodes increase their connectivity faster than their less connected peers, a phenomenon called preferential attachment. 
020       Measurements on four networks, namely the science citation network, Internet, actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree, offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment. We find that for the first two systems the attachment rate depends linearly on the node degree, while for the latter two the dependence follows a sublinear power law.

010       Topology, Hidden Spectra and Bose Einstein Condensation on low   dimensional complex networks
021       Topological inhomogeneity gives rise to spectral anomalies that can induce Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in low dimensional systems. 
020       These anomalies consist in energy regions composed of an infinite number of states with vanishing weight in the thermodynamic limit (hidden states). Here we present a rigorous result giving the most general conditions for BEC on complex networks. We prove that the presence of hidden states in the lowest region of the spectrum is the necessary and sufficient condition for condensation in low dimension (spectral dimension $\bar{d}\leq 2$), while it is shown that BEC always occurs for $\bar{d}&gt;2$.

010       Topological Reduction of Tight-Binding Models on Complex Networks
021       Complex molecules and mesoscopic structures are naturally described by general networks of elementary building blocks and tight-binding is one of the simplest quantum model suitable for studying the physical properties arising from the network topology. 
020       Despite the simplicity of the model, topological complexity can make the evaluation of the spectrum of the tight-binding Hamiltonian a rather hard task, since the lack of translation invariance rules out such a powerful tool as Fourier transform. In this paper we introduce a rigorous analytical technique, based on topological methods, for the exact solution of this problem on branched structures. Besides its analytic power, this technique is also a promising engineering tool, helpful in the design of netwoks displaying the desired spectral features.

010       Language as an Evolving Word Web
021       Human language can be described as a complex network of linked words. 
020       In such a treatment, each distinct word in language is a vertex of this web, and neighboring words in sentences are connected by edges. It was recently found (Ferrer and Sol\'e) that the distribution of the numbers of connections of words in such a network is of a peculiar form which includes two pronounced power-law regions. Here we treat language as a self-organizing network of interacting words. In the framework of this concept, we completely describe the observed Word Web structure without fitting.

020       While traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing principles. Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.

This test of strength for complex networks like Internet is more stringent than others recently considered like the random removal of nodes, analyzed within the framework of percolation theory. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our results and their relevance in forecasting cascading failures in scale-free networks.

010       Evolution of networks
021       We review the recent fast progress in statistical physics of evolving networks. 
020       Interest has focused mainly on the structural properties of random complex networks in communications, biology, social sciences and economics. A number of giant artificial networks of such a kind came into existence recently. This opens a wide field for the study of their topology, evolution, and complex processes occurring in them. Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of large sizes of these networks, the distances between most their vertices are short -- a feature known as the ``small-world'' effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free structures and the role of the mechanism of preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks, and percolation in these networks. We present a number of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study. Applications of the general results to particular networks in Nature are discussed. We demonstrate the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general problems of non-equilibrium physics, econophysics, evolutionary biology, etc.

010       Immunization of complex networks
021       Complex networks such as the sexual partnership web or the Internet often show a high degree of redundancy and heterogeneity in their connectivity properties. 
020       This peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents. Here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks. Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks. In particular, targeted immunization schemes, based on the nodes' connectivity hierarchy, sharply lower the network's vulnerability to epidemic attacks.

010       Epidemic outbreaks in complex heterogeneous networks
021       We present a detailed analytical and numerical study for the spreading of infections in complex population networks with acquired immunity. 
020       We show that the large connectivity fluctuations usually found in these networks strengthen considerably the incidence of epidemic outbreaks. Scale-free networks, which are characterized by diverging connectivity fluctuations, exhibit the lack of an epidemic threshold and always show a finite fraction of infected individuals. This particular weakness, observed also in models without immunity, defines a new epidemiological framework characterized by a highly heterogeneous response of the system to the introduction of infected individuals with different connectivity. The understanding of epidemics in complex networks might deliver new insights in the spread of information and diseases in biological and technological networks that often appear to be characterized by complex heterogeneous architectures.

010       Small-World Effects in Wealth Distribution
021       We construct a model of wealth distribution, based on an interactive multiplicative stochastic process on static complex networks. 
020       Through numerical simulations we show that a decrease in the number of links discourages equality in wealth distribution, while the rewiring of links in small-world networks encourages it. Inequal distributions obey log-normal distributions, which are produced by wealth clustering. The rewiring of links breaks the wealth clustering and makes wealth obey the mean field type (power law) distributions. A mechanism that explains the appearance of log-normal distributions with a power law tail is proposed.

010       Power-Law Scaling for Communication Networks with Transmission Errors
021       A generic communication model of a boolean network with transmission errors is proposed to explore the power-law scaling of states' evolution in small-world networks. 
020       In the model, the power spectrum of the population difference between agents with "1" and "-1" exhibits a power-law tail: $P(f)\sim f^{-\alpha}$. The exponent $\alpha$ does not depend explicitly on the error rate but on the structure of the networks. Error rate enters only into the frequency scales and thus governs the frequency range over which these power laws can be observed. On the other hand, the exponent $\alpha$ reveals the intricate internal structure of networks and can serve as a structure factor to classify complex networks. The finite transmission error is shown to provide a mechanism for the common occurrence of the power-law relation in complex systems, such as financial markets and opinion formation.

010       Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Directed Small-World Networks
021       Many social, biological, and economic systems can be approached by complex networks of interacting units. 
020       The behaviour of several models on small-world networks has recently been studied. These models are expected to capture the essential features of the complex processes taking place on real networks like disease spreading, formation of public opinion, distribution of wealth, etc. In many of these systems relations are directed, in the sense that links only act in one direction (outwards or inwards). We investigate the effect of directed links on the behaviour of a simple spin-like model evolving on a small-world network. We show that directed networks may lead to a highly nontrivial phase diagram including first and second-order phase transitions out of equilibrium.

010       Optimization in complex networks
021       Many complex systems can be described in terms of networks of interacting units. 
020       Recent studies have shown that a wide class of both natural and artificial nets display a surprisingly widespread feature: the presence of highly heterogeneous distributions of links, providing an extraordinary source of robustness against perturbations. Although most theories concerning the origin of these topologies use growing graphs, here we show that a simple optimization process can also account for the observed regularities displayed by most complex nets. Using an evolutionary algorithm involving minimization of link density and average distance, four major types of networks are encountered: (a) sparse exponential-like networks, (b) sparse scale-free networks, (c) star networks and (d) highly dense networks, apparently defining three major phases. These constraints provide a new explanation for scaling of exponent about -3. The evolutionary consequences of these results are outlined.

010       Bose-Einstein Condensation on inhomogeneous complex networks
021       The thermodynamic properties of non interacting bosons on a complex network can be strongly affected by topological inhomogeneities. 
020       The latter give rise to anomalies in the density of states that can induce Bose-Einstein condensation in low dimensional systems also in absence of external confining potentials. The anomalies consist in energy regions composed of an infinite number of states with vanishing weight in the thermodynamic limit. We present a rigorous result providing the general conditions for the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation on complex networks in presence of anomalous spectral regions in the density of states. We present results on spectral properties for a wide class of graphs where the theorem applies. We study in detail an explicit geometrical realization, the comb lattice, which embodies all the relevant features of this effect and which can be experimentally implemented as an array of Josephson Junctions.

010       Attack vulnerability of complex networks
021       We study the response of complex networks subject to attacks on vertices and edges. 
020       Several existing complex network models as well as real-world networks of scientific collaborations and Internet traffic are numerically investigated, and the network performance is quantitatively measured by the average inverse geodesic length and the size of the largest connected subgraph. For each case of attacks on vertices and edges, four different attacking strategies are used: removals by the descending order of the degree and the betweenness centrality, calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal procedure. It is found that the removals by the recalculated degrees and betweenness centralities are often more harmful than the attack strategies based on the initial network, suggesting that the network structure changes as important vertices or edges are removed. Furthermore, the correlation between the betweenness centrality and the degree in complex networks is studied.

010       Economic Small-World Behavior in Weighted Networks
021       The small-world phenomenon has been already the subject of a huge variety of papers, showing its appeareance in a variety of systems. 
020       However, some big holes still remain to be filled, as the commonly adopted mathematical formulation suffers from a variety of limitations, that make it unsuitable to provide a general tool of analysis for real networks, and not just for mathematical (topological) abstractions. In this paper we show where the major problems arise, and how there is therefore the need for a new reformulation of the small-world concept. Together with an analysis of the variables involved, we then propose a new theory of small-world networks based on two leading concepts: efficiency and cost. Efficiency measures how well information propagates over the network, and cost measures how expensive it is to build a network. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of {\em economic small worlds}, that formalizes the idea of networks that are "cheap" to build, and nevertheless efficient in propagating information, both at global and local scale. This new concept is shown to overcome all the limitations proper of the so-far commonly adopted formulation, and to provide an adequate tool to quantitatively analyze the behaviour of complex networks in the real world. Various complex systems are analyzed, ranging from the realm of neural networks, to social sciences, to communication and transportation networks. In each case, economic small worlds are found. Moreover, using the economic small-world framework, the construction principles of these networks can be quantitatively analyzed and compared, giving good insights on how efficiency and economy principles combine up to shape all these systems.

010       Scale-free Networks from Optimal Design
021       A large number of complex networks, both natural and artificial, share the presence of highly heterogeneous, scale-free degree distributions. 
020       A few mechanisms for the emergence of such patterns have been suggested, optimization not being one of them. In this letter we present the first evidence for the emergence of scaling (and smallworldness) in software architecture graphs from a well-defined local optimization process. Although the rules that define the strategies involved in software engineering should lead to a tree-like structure, the final net is scale-free, perhaps reflecting the presence of conflicting constraints unavoidable in a multidimensional optimization process. The consequences for other complex networks are outlined.

010       Percolation in Directed Scale-Free Networks
021       Many complex networks in nature have directed links, a property that affects the network's navigability and large-scale topology. 
020       Here we study the percolation properties of such directed scale-free networks with correlated in- and out-degree distributions. We derive a phase diagram that indicates the existence of three regimes, determined by the values of the degree exponents. In the first regime we regain the known directed percolation mean field exponents. In contrast, the second and third regimes are characterized by anomalous exponents, which we calculate analytically. In the third regime the network is resilient to random dilution, i.e., the percolation threshold is p_c-&gt;1.

010       Classification of scale-free networks
021       While the emergence of a power law degree distribution in complex networks is intriguing, the degree exponent is not universal. 
020       Here we show that the betweenness centrality displays a power-law distribution with an exponent \eta which is robust and use it to classify the scale-free networks. We have observed two universality classes with \eta \approx 2.2(1) and 2.0, respectively. Real world networks for the former are the protein interaction networks, the metabolic networks for eukaryotes and bacteria, and the co-authorship network, and those for the latter one are the Internet, the world-wide web, and the metabolic networks for archaea. Distinct features of the mass-distance relation, generic topology of geodesics and resilience under attack of the two classes are identified. Various model networks also belong to either of the two classes while their degree exponents are tunable.

010       Pattern Detection in Complex Networks: Correlation Profile of the   Internet
021       A general scheme for detecting and analyzing topological patterns in large complex networks is presented. 
020       In this scheme the network in question is compared with its properly randomized version that preserves some of its low-level topological properties. Statistically significant deviation of any measurable property of a network from this null model likely reflect its design principles and/or evolutionary history. We illustrate this basic scheme on the example of the correlation profile of the Internet quantifying correlations between connectivities of its neighboring nodes. This profile distinguishes the Internet from previously studied molecular networks with a similar scale-free connectivity distribution. We finally demonstrate that clustering in a network is very sensitive to both the connectivity distribution and its correlation profile and compare the clustering in the Internet to the appropriate null model.

010       Efficiency of Scale-Free Networks: Error and Attack Tolerance
021       The concept of network efficiency, recently proposed to characterize the properties of small-world networks, is here used to study the effects of errors and attacks on scale-free networks. 
020       Two different kinds of scale-free networks, i.e. networks with power law P(k), are considered: 1) scale-free networks with no local clustering produced by the Barabasi-Albert model and 2) scale-free networks with high clustering properties as in the model by Klemm and Eguiluz, and their properties are compared to the properties of random graphs (exponential graphs). By using as mathematical measures the global and the local efficiency we investigate the effects of errors and attacks both on the global and the local properties of the network. We show that the global efficiency is a better measure than the characteristic path length to describe the response of complex networks to external factors. We find that, at variance with random graphs, scale-free networks display, both on a global and on a local scale, a high degree of error tolerance and an extreme vulnerability to attacks. In fact, the global and the local efficiency are unaffected by the failure of some randomly chosen nodes, though they are extremely sensititive to the removal of the few nodes which play a crucial role in maintaining the network's connectivity.

010       Epidemic spreading in correlated complex networks
021       We study a dynamical model of epidemic spreading on complex networks in which there are explicit correlations among the node's connectivities. 
020       For the case of Markovian complex networks, showing only correlations between pairs of nodes, we find an epidemic threshold inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix that gives the average number of links that from a node with connectivity $k$ go to nodes with connectivity $k'$. Numerical simulations on a correlated growing network model provide support for our conclusions.

010       Range-based attack on links in scale-free networks: are long-range links   responsible for the small-world phenomenon?
021       The small-world phenomenon in complex networks has been identified as being due to the presence of long-range links, i.e., links connecting nodes that would otherwise be separated by a long node-to-node distance. 
020       We find, surprisingly, that many scale-free networks are more sensitive to attacks on short-range than on long-range links. This result, besides its importance concerning network efficiency and/or security, has the striking implication that the small-world property of scale-free networks is mainly due to short-range links.

010       Hierarchical Organization in Complex Networks
021       Many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. 
020       We show that these two features are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that small groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the World Wide Web, actor network, the Internet at the domain level and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems.

010       Large Scale Cross-Correlations in Internet Traffic
021       The Internet is a complex network of interconnected routers and the existence of collective behavior such as congestion suggests that the correlations between different connections play a crucial role. 
020       It is thus critical to measure and quantify these correlations. We use methods of random matrix theory (RMT) to analyze the cross-correlation matrix C of information flow changes of 650 connections between 26 routers of the French scientific network `Renater'. We find that C has the universal properties of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices: The distribution of eigenvalues--up to a rescaling which exhibits a typical correlation time of the order 10 minutes--and the spacing distribution follow the predictions of RMT. There are some deviations for large eigenvalues which contain network-specific information and which identify genuine correlations between connections. The study of the most correlated connections reveals the existence of `active centers' which are exchanging information with a large number of routers thereby inducing correlations between the corresponding connections. These strong correlations could be a reason for the observed self-similarity in the WWW traffic.

010       Macro- and micro-structure of trust networks
021       A challenging problem in the social sciences is the characterization of the formation of ``social capital''. 
020       It is believed that societies with more social capital are more democratic and economically developed than societies with little social capital. However, social capital is a concept hard to quantify and measure in a ``real-word'' context. Here, we take advantage of an existing "web of trust'' between users of the "Pretty-Good-Privacy" (PGP) encryption algorithm, which is used in digital communication to ``sign'' documents so that the recipient knows for sure who the author is. Our analysis reveals the coexistence in the web of trust of a macro scale-free structure with micro strongly-connected cells in a complex network. We also show that when this network is intentionally attacked the scale-free structure rapidly disintegrates and that the resulting network is partitioned into a large number of small strongly-connected cells that are resilient to the intentional attack.

010       Optimal network topologies for local search with congestion
021       The problem of searchability in decentralized complex networks is of great importance in computer science, economy and sociology. 
020       We present a formalism that is able to cope simultaneously with the problem of search and the congestion effects that arise when parallel searches are performed, and obtain expressions for the average search cost--written in terms of the search algorithm and the topological properties of the network--both in presence and abscence of congestion. This formalism is used to obtain optimal network structures for a system using a local search algorithm. It is found that only two classes of networks can be optimal: star-like configurations, when the number of parallel searches is small, and homogeneous-isotropic configurations, when the number of parallel searches is large.

020       This model takes into account the different nature of nodes, described by a random parameter that we call energy, and includes rewiring of the links. The system described by the mixed statistics is an inhomogemeous system formed by two class of nodes. In fact there is a threshold energy $\epsilon_s$ such that nodes with lower energy $(\epsilon&lt;\epsilon_s)$ increase their connectivity while nodes with higher energy $(\epsilon&gt;\epsilon_s)$ decrease their connectivity in time.

Formulating the problem as a graph-driven features extraction problem, based on the simple idea that relevant features are likely to exhibit correlation with respect to the topology of the graph, we end up with an algorithm which involves encoding the network and the set of expression profiles into kernel functions, and performing a regularized form of canonical correlation analysis in the corresponding reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces. <br />Function prediction experiments for the genes of the yeast S. Cerevisiae validate this approach by showing a consistent increase in performance when a state-of-the-art classifier uses the vector of features instead of the original expression profile to predict the functional class of a gene.

020       The proteome includes the whole set of protein-protein interactions, and two recent independent studies have shown that its topology displays a number of surprising features shared by other complex networks, both natural and artificial. In order to understand the origins of this topology and its evolutionary implications, we present a simple model of proteome evolution that is able to reproduce many of the observed statistical regularities reported from the analysis of the yeast proteome. Our results suggest that the observed patterns can be explained by a process of gene duplication and diversification that would evolve proteome networks under a selection pressure, favoring robustness against failure of its individual components.

020       As opposed to conventional stability analysis, here stability is determined by a multitude of linear operators. We treat this multi-operator problem analytically and show that for inhibitory interactions the synchronous state is stable, independent of the parameters and the network connectivity. In randomly connected networks with strong interactions this synchronous state, displaying \textit{regular} dynamics, coexists with a balanced state that exhibits \textit{irregular} dynamics such that external signals may switch the network between qualitatively distinct states.

010       Early Structure Formation and the Epoch of First Light
021       In popular cold dark matter cosmological scenarios, stars may have first appeared in significant numbers around a redshift of 10 or so, as the gas within protogalactic halos with virial temperatures in excess of 20,000 K (corresponding to masses comparable to those of present--day dwarf ellipticals) cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. 
020       It is this `second generation' of subgalactic stellar systems, aided perhaps by an early population of accreting black holes in their nuclei, which may have generated the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that ended the cosmic ``dark ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos by a redshift of 6. The detailed history of the universe during and soon after these crucial formative stages depends on the power--spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback' mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies. The astrophysics of the epoch of first light is recorded in the thermal state, ionization degree, and chemical composition of the intergalactic medium, the main repository of baryons at high redshifts.

010       Stability of shortest paths in complex networks with random edge weights
021       We study shortest paths and spanning trees of complex networks with random edge weights. 
020       Edges which do not belong to the spanning tree are inactive in a transport process within the network. The introduction of quenched disorder modifies the spanning tree such that some edges are activated and the network diameter is increased. With analytic random-walk mappings and numerical analysis, we find that the spanning tree is unstable to the introduction of disorder and displays a phase-transition-like behavior at zero disorder strength $\epsilon=0$. In the infinite network-size limit ($N\to \infty$), we obtain a continuous transition with the density of activated edges $\Phi$ growing like $\Phi \sim \epsilon^1$ and with the diameter-expansion coefficient $\Upsilon$ growing like $\Upsilon\sim \epsilon^2$ in the regular network, and first-order transitions with discontinuous jumps in $\Phi$ and $\Upsilon$ at $\epsilon=0$ for the small-world (SW) network and the Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free (SF) network. The asymptotic scaling behavior sets in when $N\gg N_c$, where the crossover size scales as $N_c\sim \epsilon^{-2}$ for the regular network, $N_c \sim \exp[\alpha \epsilon^{-2}]$ for the SW network, and $N_c \sim \exp[\alpha |\ln \epsilon| \epsilon^{-2}]$ for the SF network. In a transient regime with $N\ll N_c$, there is an infinite-order transition with $\Phi\sim \Upsilon \sim \exp[-\alpha / (\epsilon^2 \ln N)]$ for the SW network and $\sim \exp[ -\alpha / (\epsilon^2 \ln N/\ln\ln N)]$ for the SF network. It shows that the transport pattern is practically most stable in the SF network.

Rigorous analysis of the existing data shows that the Indian Railway network displays small-world properties. We define and estimate several other quantities associated with this network.

010       Fine-structure in the nonthermal X-ray emission of SNR RX J1713.7-3946   revealed by Chandra
021       We present morphological and spectroscopic studies of the northwest rim of the supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 based on observations by the Chandra X-ray observatory. 
020       We found a complex network of nonthermal (synchrotron) X-ray filaments, as well as a 'void' type structure -- a dim region of a circular shape -- in the northwest rim. It is remarkable that despite distinct brightness variations, the X-ray spectra everywhere in this region can be well fitted with a power-law model with photon index around 2.3. We briefly discuss some implications of these results and argue that the resolved X-ray features in the northwest rim may challenge the perceptions of standard (diffusive shock-acceleration) models concerning the production, propagation and radiation of relativistic particles in supernova remnants.

010       The Wave Mechanics of Large-scale Structure
021       I review the basic ``gravitational instability'' model for the growth of structure in the expanding Universe. 
020       This model requires the existence of small initial irregularities in the density of a largely uniform universe. These grow through linear and non-linear stages to form a complex network of clusters, filaments and voids. The dynamical equations describing the evolution of a self-gravitating fluid can be rewritten in the form of a Schrodinger equation coupled to a Poisson equation determining the gravitational potential. This approach has a number of interesting features, many of which were pointed out in a seminal paper by Widrow &amp; Kaiser (1993). I argue that this approach has the potential to yield useful analytic insights into the dynamical growth of large-scale structure. As a particular example, I show that this approach yields an elegant reformulation of an idea due to Jones (1999) concerning the origin of lognormal intermittency in the galaxy distribution.

010       Duplication Models for Biological Networks
021       Are biological networks different from other large complex networks? Both large biological and non-biological networks exhibit power-law graphs (number of nodes with degree k, N(k) ~ k-b) yet the exponents, b, fall into different ranges. 
020       This may be because duplication of the information in the genome is a dominant evolutionary force in shaping biological networks (like gene regulatory networks and protein-protein interaction networks), and is fundamentally different from the mechanisms thought to dominate the growth of most non-biological networks (such as the internet [1-4]). The preferential choice models non-biological networks like web graphs can only produce power-law graphs with exponents greater than 2 [1-4,8]. We use combinatorial probabilistic methods to examine the evolution of graphs by duplication processes and derive exact analytical relationships between the exponent of the power law and the parameters of the model. Both full duplication of nodes (with all their connections) as well as partial duplication (with only some connections) are analyzed. We demonstrate that partial duplication can produce power-law graphs with exponents less than 2, consistent with current data on biological networks. The power-law exponent for large graphs depends only on the growth process, not on the starting graph.

010       A Stochastic Evolutionary Model Exhibiting Power-Law Behaviour with an   Exponential Cutoff
021       Recently several authors have proposed stochastic evolutionary models for the growth of complex networks that give rise to power-law distributions. 
020       These models are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich get richer'' phenomenon. Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic models, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the limited size of networks such as protein and e-mail networks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the power-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of the distribution for extremely large networks. We propose a modification of the basic stochastic evolutionary model, so that after a node is chosen preferentially, say according to the number of its inlinks, there is a small probability that this node will be discarded. We show that as a result of this modification, by viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model, we obtain a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff. Unlike many other models, the current model can capture instances where the exponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the consistency of our model by analysing a yeast protein interaction network, the distribution of which is known to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff.

010       First Light and the Reionization of the Universe
021       The development of primordial inhomogeneities into the non-linear regime and the formation of the first bound objects mark the transition from a simple cooling universe -- described by just a few parameters -- to a very messy hot one -- the realm of radiative, hydrodynamic and star formation processes. 
020       In popular cold dark matter cosmological scenarios, stars and quasars may have first appeared in significant numbers around a redshift of 10 or so, as the gas within subgalactic halos cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. This early generation of sources generated the ultraviolet radiation and kinetic energy that ended the cosmic ``dark ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos by a redshift of 6. The detailed thermal history of the intergalactic medium -- the main repository of baryons at high redshift -- during and soon after these crucial formative stages depends on the power-spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback' mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies.

010       Nonequilibrium transitions in complex networks: a model of social   interaction
021       We analyze the non-equilibrium order-disorder transition of Axelrod's model of social interaction in several complex networks. 
020       In a small world network, we find a transition between an ordered homogeneous state and a disordered state. The transition point is shifted by the degree of spatial disorder of the underlying network, the network disorder favoring ordered configurations. In random scale-free networks the transition is only observed for finite size systems, showing system size scaling, while in the thermodynamic limit only ordered configurations are always obtained. Thus in the thermodynamic limit the transition disappears. However, in structured scale-free networks, the phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase is restored.

021       The linear preferential attachment hypothesis has been shown to be quite successful to explain the existence of networks with power-law degree distributions. 
020       It is then quite important to determine if this mechanism is the consequence of a general principle based on local rules. In this work it is claimed that an effective linear preferential attachment is the natural outcome of growing network models based on local rules. It is also shown that the local models offer an explanation to other properties like the clustering hierarchy and degree correlations recently observed in complex networks. These conclusions are based on both analytical and numerical results of different local rules, including some models already proposed in the literature.

010       Evolutionary games and the emergence of complex networks
021       The emergence of complex networks from evolutionary games is studied occurring when agents are allowed to switch interaction partners. 
020       For this purpose a coevolutionary iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game is defined on a random network with agents as nodes and games along the links. The agents change their neighborhoods to improve their payoff. The system relaxes to stationary states corresponding to cooperative Nash equilibria with the additional property that no agent can improve its payoff by changing its neighborhood. Small perturbations of the system lead to avalanches of strategy readjustments reestablishing equilibrium. As a result of the dynamics, the network of interactions develops non-trivial topological properties as a broad degree distribution suggesting scale-free behavior, small-world characteristics, and assortative mixing.

010       The Era of Reionization
021       In popular cold dark matter cosmological scenarios, stars may have first appeared in significant numbers around a redshift of 10 or so, as the gas within protogalactic halos with virial temperatures in excess of 20,000 K (corresponding to masses comparable to those of present-day dwarf ellipticals) cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. 
020       It is this `second generation' of subgalactic stellar systems, aided perhaps by an early population of accreting black holes in their nuclei, which may have generated the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that ended the cosmic ``dark ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the universe by a redshift of 6. The detailed history of the universe during and soon after these crucial formative stages depends on the power-spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback' mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies. The astrophysics of the epoch of first light is recorded in the thermal state, ionization degree, and chemical composition of the intergalactic medium, the main repository of baryons at high redshifts.

The analysis of data from real networks reveals the ubiquitous presence of a high level of grid-like ordering that is non-trivially correlated with the local degree properties. These observations provide new insights on the hierarchical structure of complex networks.

010       Inverse Modeling of Complex Networks Using Embedded Complex Logistic   Maps
021       An inverse modeling technique is introduced that combines elements of coupled logistic map models and wavelet analysis for the purpose of analyzing partial synchronization states in high-dimensional systems. 
020       Using Embedded Complex Logistic Maps (ECLM), time series data derived from individual system components is directly mapped to a wavelet-like space generated from iterations of specific complex logistic maps. These maps are selected from the complex plane according to "best fit" scoring criteria with the data. The embedding topology within and near the familiar Mandelbrot Set provides metrics which are used to aid in clustering similarities (synchronization) between these selected point models. The dynamics within the individual models and the correlation between (synchronized) models is analyzed to reconstruct a unified picture of the underlying dynamics of local system components within the global system network topology. In this paper, ECLM is used to extract system parameters, network graphs, and wavelet-like analytics from two real-world systems, a gene expression network and a financial market network. Preliminary results appear to validate the assumptions and methods used in ECLM through agreement with current theory and recent findings. Some potentially new findings regarding synchronization, scale-free networks, on-off intermittency, and energy dissipation within the examples studied will also be discussed.

010       Congestion and centrality in traffic flow on complex networks
021       The central points of communication network flow has often been identified using graph theoretical centrality measures. 
020       In real networks, the state of traffic density arises from an interplay between the dynamics of the flow and the underlying network structure. In this work we investigate the relationship between centrality measures and the density of traffic for some simple particle hopping models on networks with emerging scale-free degree distributions. We also study how the speed of the dynamics are affected by the underlying network structure. Among other conclusions, we find that, even at low traffic densities, the dynamical measure of traffic density (the occupation ratio) has a non-trivial dependence on the static centrality (quantified by "betweenness centrality"), which non-central vertices getting a comparatively large portion of the traffic.

020       Networks are mathematical tools used in the modelling of a wide variety of systems in social and natural science. Examples of these networks range from metabolic and cell networks to technological webs. Here we present the first empirical characterization of the world trade web, that is, the network built upon the trade relationships between different countries in the world. This network displays the typical properties of complex networks, namely, scale-free degree distribution, the {\it small world} property, a high clustering coefficient and, in addition, degree-degree correlation between different vertices. All these properties make the world trade web a complex network, which is far from being well-described through a classical random network description.

010       Cascade-based attacks on complex networks
021       We live in a modern world supported by large, complex networks. 
020       Examples range from financial markets to communication and transportation systems. In many realistic situations the flow of physical quantities in the network, as characterized by the loads on nodes, is important. We show that for such networks where loads can redistribute among the nodes, intentional attacks can lead to a cascade of overload failures, which can in turn cause the entire or a substantial part of the network to collapse. This is relevant for real-world networks that possess a highly heterogeneous distribution of loads, such as the Internet and power grids. We demonstrate that the heterogeneity of these networks makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks in that a large-scale cascade may be triggered by disabling a single key node. This brings obvious concerns on the security of such systems.

A simple model for the evolution of acquaintance networks highlights the essential dynamical ingredients necessary to obtain such complex network structures. The model generates highly clustered networks with small average path lengths and scale-free as well as exponential degree distributions. It compares well with experimental data of social networks, as for example coauthorship networks in high energy physics.

010       Optimal Size of a Complex Network
021       We investigate the response behavior of an Ising system, driven by an oscillating field, on a small-world network, with particular attention to the effects of the system size. 
020       The responses of the magnetization to the driving field are probed by means of Monte Carlo dynamic simulations with the rewiring probability varied. It is found that at low and high temperatures the occupancy ratio, measuring how many spins follow the driving field, behaves monotonically with the system size. At intermediate temperatures, on the other hand, the occupancy ratio first grows and then reduces as the size is increased, displaying a resonance-like peak at a finite value of the system size. In all cases, further increase of the size eventually leads to saturation to finite values; the size at which saturation emerges is observed to depend on the temperature, similarly to the correlation length of the system.

010       Distance, dissimilarity index, and network community structure
021       We address the question of finding the community structure of a complex network. 
020       In an earlier effort [H. Zhou, {\em Phys. Rev. E} (2003)], the concept of network random walking is introduced and a distance measure defined. Here we calculate, based on this distance measure, the dissimilarity index between nearest-neighboring vertices of a network and design an algorithm to partition these vertices into communities that are hierarchically organized. Each community is characterized by an upper and a lower dissimilarity threshold. The algorithm is applied to several artificial and real-world networks, and excellent results are obtained. In the case of artificially generated random modular networks, this method outperforms the algorithm based on the concept of edge betweenness centrality. For yeast's protein-protein interaction network, we are able to identify many clusters that have well defined biological functions.

010       The Dawn of Galaxies
021       The development of primordial inhomogeneities into the non-linear regime and the formation of the first astrophysical objects within dark matter halos mark the transition from a simple, neutral, cooling universe -- described by just a few parameters -- to a messy ionized one -- the realm of radiative, hydrodynamic, and star formation processes. 
020       The recent measurement by the WMAP satellite of a large optical depth to electron scattering implies that this transition must have begun very early, and that the universe was reionized at redshift z_ion=17\pm 5. It is an early generation of extremely metal-poor massive stars and/or `seed' accreting black holes in subgalactic halos that may have generated the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos. The detailed thermal, ionization, and chemical enrichment history of the universe during the crucial formative stages around z=10-20 depends on the power-spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales, the stellar initial mass function and star formation efficiency, a complex network of poorly understood `feedback' mechanisms, and remains one of the crucial missing links in galaxy formation and evolution studies.

010       The structure and function of complex networks
021       Inspired by empirical studies of networked systems such as the Internet, social networks, and biological networks, researchers have in recent years developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand or predict the behavior of these systems. 
020       Here we review developments in this field, including such concepts as the small-world effect, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth and preferential attachment, and dynamical processes taking place on networks.

010       Investigation of a Protein Complex Network
021       The budding yeast {\it Saccharomyces cerevisiae} is the first eukaryote whose genome has been completely sequenced. 
020       It is also the first eukaryotic cell whose proteome (the set of all proteins) and interactome (the network of all mutual interactions between proteins) has been analyzed. In this paper we study the structure of the yeast protein complex network in which weighted edges between complexes represent the number of shared proteins. It is found that the network of protein complexes is a small world network with scale free behavior for many of its distributions. However we find that there are no strong correlations between the weights and degrees of neighboring complexes. To reveal non-random features of the network we also compare it with a null model in which the complexes randomly select their proteins. Finally we propose a simple evolutionary model based on duplication and divergence of proteins.

010       Netons: Vibrations of Complex Networks
021       We consider atoms interacting each other through the topological structure of a complex network and investigate lattice vibrations of the system, the quanta of which we call {\em netons} for convenience. 
020       The density of neton levels, obtained numerically, reveals that unlike a local regular lattice, the system develops a gap of a finite width, manifesting extreme rigidity of the network structure at low energies. Two different network models, the small-world network and the scale-free network, are compared: The characteristic structure of the former is described by an additional peak in the level density whereas a power-law tail is observed in the latter, indicating excitability of netons at arbitrarily high energies. The gap width is also found to vanish in the small-world network when the connection range $r = 1$.

010       A Tractable Complex Network Model based on the Stochastic Mean-field   Model of Distance
021       Much recent research activity has been devoted to empirical study and theoretical models of complex networks (random graphs) with three qualitative features: power-law degree distribution, local clustering of edges, and small diameter. 
020       We point out a new (in this context) platform for such models -- the stochastic mean-field model of distance -- and within this platform study a simple two-parameter proportional attachment model. The model is mathematicallly natural, permits a wide variety of explicit calculations, has the desired three qualitative features, and fits the complete range of degree scaling exponents and clustering parameters; in these respects it compares favorably to existing models.

010       Optimal Paths in Disordered Complex Networks
021       We study the optimal distance in networks, $\ell_{\scriptsize opt}$, defined as the length of the path minimizing the total weight, in the presence of disorder. 
020       Disorder is introduced by assigning random weights to the links or nodes. For strong disorder, where the maximal weight along the path dominates the sum, we find that $\ell_{\scriptsize opt}\sim N^{1/3}$ in both Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) and Watts-Strogatz (WS) networks. For scale free (SF) networks, with degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$, we find that $\ell_{\scriptsize opt}$ scales as $N^{(\lambda - 3)/(\lambda - 1)}$ for $3&lt;\lambda&lt;4$ and as $N^{1/3}$ for $\lambda\geq 4$. Thus, for these networks, the small-world nature is destroyed. For $2 &lt; \lambda &lt; 3$, our numerical results suggest that $\ell_{\scriptsize opt}$ scales as $\ln^{\lambda-1}N$. We also find numerically that for weak disorder $\ell_{\scriptsize opt}\sim\ln N$ for both the ER and WS models as well as for SF networks.

010       Software systems as complex networks: structure, function, and   evolvability of software collaboration graphs
021       Software systems emerge from mere keystrokes to form intricate functional networks connecting many collaborating modules, objects, classes, methods, and subroutines. 
020       Building on recent advances in the study of complex networks, I have examined software collaboration graphs contained within several open-source software systems, and have found them to reveal scale-free, small-world networks similar to those identified in other technological, sociological, and biological systems. I present several measures of these network topologies, and discuss their relationship to software engineering practices. I also present a simple model of software system evolution based on refactoring processes which captures some of the salient features of the observed systems. Some implications of object-oriented design for questions about network robustness, evolvability, degeneracy, and organization are discussed in the wake of these findings.

010       On the master equation approach to diffusive grain-surface chemistry:   the H, O, CO system
021       We have used the master equation approach to study a moderately complex network of diffusive reactions occurring on the surfaces of interstellar dust particles. 
020       This network is meant to apply to dense clouds in which a large portion of the gas-phase carbon has already been converted to carbon monoxide. Hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms, and CO molecules are allowed to accrete onto dust particles and their chemistry is followed. The stable molecules produced are oxygen, hydrogen, water, carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (H2CO), and methanol (CH3OH). The surface abundances calculated via the master equation approach are in good agreement with those obtained via a Monte Carlo method but can differ considerably from those obtained with standard rate equations.

010       Quantum and classical diffusion in small-world networks
021       We study numerically quantum diffusion of a particle on small-world networks by integrating the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation with a localized initial state. 
020       The participation ratio, which corresponds to the number of visited sites in the case of classical diffusion, as a function of time is measured and the corresponding diffusion time $\tau$ is computed. In a local regular network, i.e., in the network with the rewiring probability $p=0$, the diffusion time depends on the network size $N$ as $\tau \sim N$, while the behavior $\tau \sim \log N$ is observed as $p$ becomes finite. Such fast diffusion of a particle on a complex network suggests that the small-world transition is also the fast-world transition from a dynamic point of view. The classical diffusion behavior is also studied and compared with the quantum behavior.

010       Fluctuations in network dynamics
021       Most complex networks serve as conduits for various dynamical processes, ranging from mass transfer by chemical reactions in the cell to packet transfer on the Internet. 
020       We collected data on the time dependent activity of five natural and technological networks, finding that for each the coupling of the flux fluctuations with the total flux on individual nodes obeys a unique scaling law. We show that the observed scaling can explain the competition between the system's internal collective dynamics and changes in the external environment, allowing us to predict the relevant scaling exponents.

010       Spectra of complex networks
021       We propose a general approach to the description of spectra of complex networks. 
020       For the spectra of networks with uncorrelated vertices (and a local tree-like structure), exact equations are derived. These equations are generalized to the case of networks with correlations between neighboring vertices. The tail of the density of eigenvalues $\rho(\lambda)$ at large $|\lambda|$ is related to the behavior of the vertex degree distribution $P(k)$ at large $k$. In particular, as $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$, $\rho(\lambda) \sim |\lambda|^{1-2\gamma}$. We propose a simple approximation, which enables us to calculate spectra of various graphs analytically. We analyse spectra of various complex networks and discuss the role of vertices of low degree. We show that spectra of locally tree-like random graphs may serve as a starting point in the analysis of spectral properties of real-world networks, e.g., of the Internet.

010       A spatial network explanation for a hierarchy of urban power laws
021       The presented model provides an explanation to several empirically observed phenomena in spatial economics. 
020       By representing the system as a complex network of fixed-size land areas connected by trade between harbored activities, city size and land value distributions are obtained as higher-order patterns. The model predicts the empirically observed spatial distribution of land value density as well as that of urban cluster prices. To connect land value to population, which is a commonly observed quantity, we also demonstrate that there is, for urban clusters, a linear relation between accumulated land value and population.

010       A Complex Network Approach to Topographical Connections
021       The neuronal networks in the mammals cortex are characterized by the coexistence of hierarchy, modularity, short and long range interactions, spatial correlations, and topographical connections. 
020       Particularly interesting, the latter type of organization implies special demands on the evolutionary and ontogenetic systems in order to achieve precise maps preserving spatial adjacencies, even at the expense of isometry. Although object of intensive biological research, the elucidation of the main anatomic-functional purposes of the ubiquitous topographical connections in the mammals brain remains an elusive issue. The present work reports on how recent results from complex network formalism can be used to quantify and model the effect of topographical connections between neuronal cells over a number of relevant network properties such as connectivity, adjacency, and information broadcasting. While the topographical mapping between two cortical modules are achieved by connecting nearest cells from each module, three kinds of network models are adopted for implementing intracortical connections (ICC), including random, preferential-attachment, and short-range networks. It is shown that, though spatially uniform and simple, topographical connections between modules can lead to major changes in the network properties, fostering more effective intercommunication between the involved neuronal cells and modules. The possible implications of such effects on cortical operation are discussed.

010       A Realistic Model for Complex Networks
021       It appeared recently that the classical random network model used to represent complex networks does not capture their main properties (clustering, degree distribution). 
020       Since then, various attempts have been made to provide network models having these properties. We propose here the first model which achieves the following challenges: it produces networks which have the three main wanted properties, it is based on some real-world observations, and it is sufficiently simple to make it possible to prove its main properties. We first give an overview of the field by presenting the main models introduced until now, then we discuss some remarks on some complex networks which lead us to the definition of our model. We then show that the model has the expected properties and that it can actually be seen as a general model for complex networks.

010       Hierarchical Small Worlds in Software Architecture
021       In this paper, we present a complex network approach to the study of software engineering. 
020       We have found universal network patterns in a large collection of object-oriented (OO) software systems written in C++ and Java. All the systems analyzed here display the small-world behavior, that is, the average distance between any pair of classes is very small even when coupling is low and cohesion is high. In addition, the structure of OO software is a very heterogeneous network characterized by a degree distribution following a power-law with similar exponents. We have investigated the origin of these universal patterns. Our study suggests that some features of OO programing languages, like encapsulation, seem to be largely responsible for the small-world behavior. On the other hand, software heterogeneity is largely independent of the purpose and objectives of the particular system under study and appears to be related to a pattern of constrained growth. A number of software engineering topics may benefit from the present approach, including empirical software measurement and program comprehension.

010       The emergent properties of a dolphin social network
021       Many complex networks, including human societies, the Internet, the World Wide Web and power grids, have surprising properties that allow vertices (individuals, nodes, Web pages, etc.) to be in close contact and information to be transferred quickly between them. 
020       Nothing is known of the emerging properties of animal societies, but it would be expected that similar trends would emerge from the topology of animal social networks. Despite its small size (64 individuals), the Doubtful Sound community of bottlenose dolphins has the same characteristics. The connectivity of individuals follows a complex distribution that has a scale-free power-law distribution for large k. In addition, the ability for two individuals to be in contact is unaffected by the random removal of individuals. The removal of individuals with many links to others does affect the length of the information path between two individuals, but, unlike other scale-free networks, it does not fragment the cohesion of the social network. These self-organizing phenomena allow the network to remain united, even in the case of catastrophic death events.

021       We investigate random walks on complex networks and derive an exact expression for the mean first passage time (MFPT) between two nodes. 
020       We introduce for each node the random walk centrality $C$, which is the ratio between its coordination number and a characteristic relaxation time, and show that it determines essentially the MFPT. The centrality of a node determines the relative speed by which a node can receive and spread information over the network in a random process. Numerical simulations of an ensemble of random walkers moving on paradigmatic network models confirm this analytical prediction.

021       Real complex networks are often characterized by spatial constraints such as the relative position and adjacency of nodes. 
020       The present work describes how Voronoi tessellations of the space where the network is embedded provide not only a natural means for relating such networks with metric spaces, but also a natural means for obtaining fractal complex networks. A series of comprehensive measurements closely related to spatial aspects of these networks is proposed, which includes the effective length, adjacency, as well as the fractal dimension of the network in terms of the spatial scales defined by successive shortest paths starting from a specific node. The potential of such features is illustrated with respect to the random, small-world, scale-free and fractal network models.

020       We propose a simple dynamical process used to construct networks which are either maximally or minimally hierarchical. Comparison with these extremal cases as well as with random scale-free networks allows us to better understand hierarchical versus modular features in several real-life complex networks. For random scale-free topologies the extent of topological hierarchy is shown to smoothly decline with $\gamma$ -- the exponent of a degree distribution -- reaching its highest possible value for $\gamma \leq 2$ and quickly approaching zero for $\gamma&gt;3$.

010       Breaking Synchrony by Heterogeneity in Complex Networks
021       For networks of pulse-coupled oscillators with complex connectivity, we demonstrate that in the presence of coupling heterogeneity precisely timed periodic firing patterns replace the state of global synchrony that exists in homogenous networks only. 
020       With increasing disorder, these patterns persist until they reach a critical temporal extent that is of the order of the interaction delay. For stronger disorder these patterns cease to exist and only asynchronous, aperiodic states are observed. We derive self-consistency equations to predict the precise temporal structure of a pattern from the network heterogeneity. Moreover, we show how to design heterogenous coupling architectures to create an arbitrary prescribed pattern.

This is particularly important for real-world networks with an highly hetereogeneous distribution of loads as the Internet and electrical power grids.

010       What's in a name?
021       Among the several findings deriving from the application of complex network formalism to the investigation of natural phenomena, the fact that linguistic constructions follow power laws presents special interest for its potential implications for psychology and brain science. 
020       By corresponding to one of the most essentially human manifestations, such language-related properties suggest that similar dynamics may also be inherent to the brain areas related to language and associative memory, and perhaps even consciousness. The present work reports a preliminary experimental investigation aimed at characterizing and modeling the flow of sequentially induced associations between words from the English language in terms of complex networks. The data is produced through a psychophysical experiment where a word is presented to the subject, who is requested to associate another word. Complex network and graph theory formalism and measurements are applied in order to characterize the experimental data. Several interesting results are identified, including the characterization of attraction basins, association asymmetries, context biasing, as well as a possible power-law underlying word associations, which could be explained by the appearance of strange loops along the hierarchical structure underlying word categories.

010       Betweenness Centrality in Large Complex Networks
021       We analyze the betweenness centrality (BC) of nodes in large complex networks. 
020       In general, the BC is increasing with connectivity as a power law with an exponent $\eta$. We find that for trees or networks with a small loop density $\eta=2$ while a larger density of loops leads to $\eta&lt;2$. For scale-free networks characterized by an exponent $\gamma$ which describes the connectivity distribution decay, the BC is also distributed according to a power law with a non universal exponent $\delta$. We show that this exponent $\delta$ must satisfy the exact bound $\delta\geq (\gamma+1)/2$. If the scale free network is a tree, then we have the equality $\delta=(\gamma+1)/2$.

010       Epidemic Incidence in Correlated Complex Networks
021       We introduce a numerical method to solve epidemic models on the underlying topology of complex networks. 
020       The approach exploits the mean-field like rate equations describing the system and allows to work with very large system sizes, where Monte Carlo simulations are useless due to memory needs. We then study the SIR epidemiological model on assortative networks, providing numerical evidence of the absence of epidemic thresholds. Besides, the time profiles of the populations are analyzed. Finally, we stress that the present method would allow to solve arbitrary epidemic-like models provided that they can be described by mean-field rate equations.

010       Endogenous Versus Exogenous Shocks in Complex Networks: an Empirical   Test Using Book Sale Ranking
021       Are large biological extinctions such as the Cretaceous/Tertiary KT boundary due to a meteorite, extreme volcanic activity or self-organized critical extinction cascades? Are commercial successes due to a progressive reputation cascade or the result of a well orchestrated advertisement? Determining the chain of causality for extreme events in complex systems requires disentangling interwoven exogenous and endogenous contributions with either no clear or too many signatures. 
020       Here, we study the precursory and recovery signatures accompanying shocks, that we test on a unique database of the Amazon sales ranking of books. We find clear distinguishing signatures classifying two types of sales peaks. Exogenous peaks occur abruptly and are followed by a power law relaxation, while endogenous sale peaks occur after a progressively accelerating power law growth followed by an approximately symmetrical power law relaxation which is slower than for exogenous peaks. These results are rationalized quantitatively by a simple model of epidemic propagation of interactions with long memory within a network of acquaintances. The slow relaxation of sales implies that the sales dynamics is dominated by cascades rather than by the direct effects of news or advertisements, indicating that the social network is close to critical.

010       Self-organized Model for Modular Complex Networks : Division and   Independence
021       We introduce a minimal network model which generates a modular structure in a self-organized way. 
020       To this end, we modify the Barabasi-Albert model into the one evolving under the principle of division and independence as well as growth and preferential attachment (PA). A newly added vertex chooses one of the modules composed of existing vertices, and attaches edges to vertices belonging to that module following the PA rule. When the module size reaches a proper size, the module is divided into two, and a new module is created. The karate club network studied by Zachary is a prototypical example. We find that the model can reproduce successfully the behavior of the hierarchical clustering coefficient of a vertex with degree k, C(k), in good agreement with empirical measurements of real world networks.

010       Spatial Small Worlds: New Geographic Patterns for an Information Economy
021       Networks are structures that pervade many natural and man-made phenomena. 
020       Recent findings have characterized many networks as not random structures, but as efficent complex formations. Current research has examined complex networks as largely non-spatial phenomena. Location, distance, and geograhpy, though, are vital aspects of a wide variety of networks. This paper will examine the United State's portion of the Internet's infrastructure as a complex network and what role distance and geography play in its formation. From these findings implications will be drawn on the economic, political, and national security impacts of network formation and evolution in an information economy.

010       Exchanges in complex networks: income and wealth distributions
021       We investigate the wealth evolution in a system of agents that exchange wealth through a disordered network in presence of an additive stochastic Gaussian noise. 
020       We show that the resulting wealth distribution is shaped by the degree distribution of the underlying network and in particular we verify that scale free networks generate distributions with power-law tails in the high-income region. Numerical simulations of wealth exchanges performed on two different kind of networks show the inner relation between the wealth distribution and the network properties and confirm the agreement with a self-consistent solution. We show that empirical data for the income distribution in Australia are qualitatively well described by our theoretical predictions.

010       Potts model on complex networks
021       We consider the general p-state Potts model on random networks with a given degree distribution (random Bethe lattices). 
020       We find the effect of the suppression of a first order phase transition in this model when the degree distribution of the network is fat-tailed, that is, in more precise terms, when the second moment of the distribution diverges. In this situation the transition is continuous and of infinite order, and size effect is anomalously strong. In particular, in the case of $p=1$, we arrive at the exact solution, which coincides with the known solution of the percolation problem on these networks.

020       The influence of the topological structure of the network in these processes is studied by analyzing the behavior of several global parameters such as reliability, efficiency and load. Large scale numerical simulations of update spreading processes show that while networks with homogeneous connectivity patterns permit a higher reliability, scale-free topologies allow for a better efficiency.

010       A Heavenly Example of Scale Free Networks and Self-Organized Criticality
021       The sun provides an explosive, heavenly example of self-organized criticality. 
020       Sudden bursts of intense radiation emanate from rapid rearrangements of the magnetic field network in the corona. Avalanches are triggered by loops of flux that reconnect or snap into lower energy configurations when they are overly stressed. Our recent analysis of observational data reveals that the loops (links) and footpoints (nodes), where they attach on the photosphere, embody a scale free network. The statistics of the avalanches and of the network structure are unified through a simple dynamical model where the avalanches and network co-generate each other into a complex, critical state. This particular example points toward a general dynamical mechanism for self-generation of complex networks.

010       Dynamical Motifs: Building Blocks of Complex Network Dynamics
021       Spatio-temporal network dynamics is an emergent property of many complex systems which remains poorly understood. 
020       We suggest a new approach to its study based on the analysis of dynamical motifs -- small subnetworks with periodic and chaotic dynamics. We simulate randomly connected neural networks and, with increasing density of connections, observe the transition from quiescence to periodic and chaotic dynamics. We explain this transition by the appearance of dynamical motifs in the structure of these networks. We also observe domination of periodic dynamics in simulations of spatially distributed networks with local connectivity and explain it by absence of chaotic and presence of periodic motifs in their structure.

010       Network connection strengths: Another power-law?
021       It has been discovered recently that many social, biological and ecological systems have the so-called small-world and scale-free features, which has provoked new research interest in the studies of various complex networks. 
020       Yet, most network models studied thus far are binary, with the linking strengths being either 0 or 1, while which are best described by weighted-linking networks, in which the vertices interact with each other with varying strengths. Here we found that the distribution of connection strengths of scientific collaboration networks decays also in a power-law form and we conjecture that all weighted-linking networks of this type follow the same distribution.

010       Velocity and hierarchical spread of epidemic outbreaks in scale-free   networks
021       We study the effect of the connectivity pattern of complex networks on the propagation dynamics of epidemics. 
020       The growth time scale of outbreaks is inversely proportional to the network degree fluctuations, signaling that epidemics spread almost instantaneously in networks with scale-free degree distributions. This feature is associated with an epidemic propagation that follows a precise hierarchical dynamics. Once the highly connected hubs are reached, the infection pervades the network in a progressive cascade across smaller degree classes. The present results are relevant for the development of adaptive containment strategies.

010       Opinion formation in networked societies with strong leaders
021       Recent studies show that many types of human social activities, from scientific collaborations to sexual contacts, can be understood in terms of complex network of interactions. 
020       Such networking paradigm allows to model many aspects of social behaviour with relatively simple computer models. The present work investigates the influence of single leaders on opinion formation within simulations of agent based artificial networked societies. Several types of network systems (among them random networks, highly clustered, small world and scale-free) are studied. The strength of the social influence of individuals is assumed to be dictated by distance from an agent to another, as well as individual strengths of the agents. We study the effect of different topologies on the conditions of general acceptance of leader's opinion by the society.

010       On the uniform generation of random graphs with prescribed degree   sequences
021       Random graphs with prescribed degree sequences have been widely used as a model of complex networks. 
020       Comparing an observed network to an ensemble of such graphs allows one to detect deviations from randomness in network properties. Here we briefly review two existing methods for the generation of random graphs with arbitrary degree sequences, which we call the ``switching'' and ``matching'' methods, and present a new method based on the ``go with the winners'' Monte Carlo method. The matching method may suffer from nonuniform sampling, while the switching method has no general theoretical bound on its mixing time. The ``go with the winners'' method has neither of these drawbacks, but is slow. It can however be used to evaluate the reliability of the other two methods and, by doing this, we demonstrate that the deviations of the switching and matching algorithms under realistic conditions are small compared to the ``go with the winners'' algorithm. Because of its combination of speed and accuracy we recommend the use of the switching method for most calculations.

020       These equations are solved numerically by means of a stochastic approach. First, we present analytical and Monte Carlo calculations for homogeneous networks and compare the results with those obtained by the numerical method. Then, we study the spreading process in detail for random scale-free networks. The time profiles for several quantities are numerically computed, which allow us to distinguish among different variants of rumor spreading algorithms. Our conclusions are directed to possible applications in replicated database maintenance, peer to peer communication networks and social spreading phenomena.

We present a model where board directors are engaged in a decision making dynamics based on "herd behavior". Boards influence each other through shared directors. <br />We find that imitation of colleagues and opinion bias due to the interlock do not trigger an avalanche of identical decisions over the board network, whereas the information about interlocked boards' decisions does. There is no need to invoke global public information, nor external driving forces. <br />This model provides a simple endogenous mechanism to explain the fact that boards of the largest corporations of a country can, in the span of a few months, take the same decisions about general topics.

010       Preferential Exchange: Strengthening Connections in Complex Networks
021       Many social, technological and biological interactions involve network relationships whose outcome intimately depends on the structure of the network and on the strengths of the connections. 
020       Yet, although much information is now available concerning the structure of many networks, the strengths are more difficult to measure. Here we show that, for one particular social network, notably the e-mail network, a suitable measure of the strength of the connections can be available. We also propose a simple mechanism, based on positive feedback and reciprocity, that can explain the observed behavior and that hints toward specific dynamics of formation and reinforcement of network connections. Network data from contexts different from social sciences indicate that power-law, and generally broad, distributions of the connection strength are ubiquitous, and the proposed mechanism has a wide range of applicability.

010       Diffusion on Complex Networks : A way to probe their large scale   topological structures
021       A diffusion process on complex networks is introduced in order to uncover their large scale topological structures. 
020       This is achieved by focusing on the slowest decaying diffusive modes of the network. The proposed procedure is applied to real-world networks like a friendship network of known modular structure, and an Internet routing network. For the friendship network, its known structure is well reproduced. In case of the Internet, where the structure is far less well-known, one indeed finds a modular structure, and modules can roughly be associated with individual countries. Quantitatively the modular structure of the Internet manifests itself in an approximately 10 times larger participation ratio of its slowest decaying modes as compared to the null model -- a random scale-free network. The extreme edges of the Internet are found to correspond to Russian and US military sites.

010       Thesaurus as a complex network
021       A thesaurus is one, out of many, possible representations of term (or word) connectivity. 
020       The terms of a thesaurus are seen as the nodes and their relationship as the links of a directed graph. The directionality of the links retains all the thesaurus information and allows the measurement of several quantities. This has lead to a new term classification according to the characteristics of the nodes, for example, nodes with no links in, no links out, etc. Using an electronic available thesaurus we have obtained the incoming and outgoing link distributions. While the incoming link distribution follows a stretched exponential function, the lower bound for the outgoing link distribution has the same envelope of the scientific paper citation distribution proposed by Albuquerque and Tsallis. However, a better fit is obtained by simpler function which is the solution of Ricatti's differential equation. We conjecture that this differential equation is the continuous limit of a stochastic growth model of the thesaurus network. We also propose a new manner to arrange a thesaurus using the ``inversion method''.

It is found that random networks allow higher computing efficiency than their scale-free counterparts as a consequence of the smaller number of isolated clusters implied by the former model. At the same time, for fixed cluster sizes, the scale free model tend to provide slightly better efficiency. Two modifications of the random and scale free paradigms, where new connections tend to favor more recently added nodes, are proposed and shown to be more effective for grid computing than the standard models. A well-defined correlation is observed between the topological properties of the network and their respective computing efficiency.

010       The Hierarchical Backbone of Complex Networks
021       Given any complex directed network, a set of acyclic subgraphs - the hierarchical backbone of the network - can be extracted that will provide valuable information about its hierarchical structure. 
020       The current paper presents how the interpretation of the network weight matrix as a transition matrix allows the hierarchical backbone to be identified and characterized in terms of the concepts of hierarchical degree, which expresses the total number of virtual edges established along successive transitions, and of hierarchical successors, namely the number of nodes accessible from a specific node while moving successive hierarchical levels. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated with respect to word associations and gene sequencing data.

010       Expanded Complex Networks and their Percolations
021       Given a complex network, its \emph{L-}paths correspond to sequences of $L+1$ distinct nodes connected through $L$ distinct edges. 
020       The \emph{L-}conditional expansion of a complex network can be obtained by connecting all its pairs of nodes which are linked through at least one \emph{L-}path, and the respective conditional \emph{L-}expansion of the original network is defined as the intersection between the original network and its \emph{L-}expansion. Such expansions are verified to act as filters enhancing the network connectivity, consequently contributing to the identification of communities in small-world models. It is shown in this paper for L=2 and 3, in both analytical and experimental fashion, that an evolving complex network with fixed number of nodes undergoes successive phase transitions -- the so-called \emph{L-}percolations, giving rise to Eulerian giant clusters. It is also shown that the critical values of such percolations are a function of the network size, and that the networks percolates for L=3 before L=2.

010       Reinforcing the Resilience of Complex Networks
021       Given a connected network, it can be augmented by applying a growing strategy (e.g. 
020       random or scale-free rules) over the previously existing structure. Another approach for augmentation, recently introduced, involves incorporating a direct edge between any two nodes which are found to be connected through at least one self-avoiding path of length L. This work investigates the resilience of random and scale-free models augmented by using the three schemes identified above. Considering random and scale-free networks, their giant cluster are identified and reinforced, then the resilience of the resulting networks with respect to highest degree node attack is quantified through simulations. The results, which indicate that substantial reinforcement of the resilience of complex networks can be achieved by the expansions, also confirm the superior robustness of the random expansion.

010       Long Chaotic Transients in Complex Networks
021       We show that long chaotic transients dominate the dynamics of randomly diluted networks of pulse-coupled oscillators. 
020       This contrasts with the rapid convergence towards limit cycle attractors found in networks of globally coupled units. The lengths of the transients strongly depend on the network connectivity and varies by several orders of magnitude, with maximum transient lengths at intermediate connectivities. The dynamics of the transient exhibits a novel form of robust synchronization. An approximation to the largest Lyapunov exponent characterizing the chaotic nature of the transient dynamics is calculated analytically.

010       Cascade control and defense in complex networks
021       Complex networks with heterogeneous distribution of loads may undergo a global cascade of overload failures when highly loaded nodes or edges are removed due to attacks or failures. 
020       Since a small attack or failure has the potential to trigger a global cascade, a fundamental question regards the possible strategies of defense to prevent the cascade from propagating through the entire network. Here we introduce and investigate a costless strategy of defense based on a selective further removal of nodes and edges, right after the initial attack or failure. This intentional removal of network elements is shown to drastically reduce the size of the cascade.

010       Traffic on complex networks: Towards understanding global statistical   properties from microscopic density fluctuations
021       We study the microscopic time fluctuations of traffic-load and the global statistical properties of a dense traffic of particles on scale-free cyclic graphs. 
020       For a wide range of driving rates $R$ the traffic is stationary and the load timeseries exhibit anti-persistence due to the regulatory role of the super-structure associated with two hub nodes in the network. We discuss how the super-structure effects the functioning of the network at high traffic density and at the jamming threshold. The degree of correlations systematically decreases with increasing traffic density and eventually disappears when approaching a jamming density $R_c$. Already before jamming we observe qualitative changes in the global network-load distributions and the particle queuing-times. These changes are related to the occurrence of temporary crises in which the network-load increases dramatically, and then slowly falls back to a value characterizing free-flow.

010       Return times of random walk on generalized random graphs
021       Random walks are used for modeling various dynamics in, for example, physical, biological, and social contexts. 
020       Furthermore, their characteristics provide us with useful information on the phase transition and critical phenomena of even broader classes of related stochastic models. Abundant results are obtained for random walk on simple graphs such as the regular lattices and the Cayley trees. However, random walks and related processes on more complex networks, which are often more relevant in the real world, are still open issues, possibly yielding different characteristics. In this paper, we investigate the return times of random walks on random graphs with arbitrary vertex degree distributions. We analytically derive the distributions of the return times. The results are applied to some types of networks and compared with numerical data.

010       Local versus Global Knowledge in the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network   model
021       The scale-free model of Barabasi and Albert gave rise to a burst of activity in the field of complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we revisit one of the main assumptions of the model, the preferential attachment rule. We study a model in which the PA rule is applied to a neighborhood of newly created nodes and thus no global knowledge of the network is assumed. We numerically show that global properties of the BA model such as the connectivity distribution and the average shortest path length are quite robust when there is some degree of local knowledge. In contrast, other properties such as the clustering coefficient and degree-degree correlations differ and approach the values measured for real-world networks.

010       Power laws in biological networks
021       The rapidly developing theory of complex networks indicates that real networks are not random, but have a highly robust large-scale architecture, governed by strict organizational principles. 
020       Here, we focus on the properties of biological networks, discussing their scale-free and hierarchical features. We illustrate the major network characteristics using examples from the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli. We also discuss the principles of network utilization, acknowledging that the interactions in a real network have unequal strengths. We study the interplay between topology and reaction fluxes provided by flux-balance analysis. We find that the cellular utilization of the metabolic network is both globally and locally highly inhomogeneous, dominated by "hot-spots", representing connected high-flux pathways.

010       Nonlinear Barab\'asi-Albert Network
021       In recent years there has been considerable interest in the structure and dynamics of complex networks. 
020       One of the most studied networks is the linear Barab\'asi-Albert model. Here we investigate the nonlinear Barab\'asi-Albert growing network. In this model, a new node connects to a vertex of degree $k$ with a probability proportional to $k^{\alpha}$ ($\alpha$ real). Each vertex adds $m$ new edges to the network. We derive an analytic expression for the degree distribution $P(k)$ which is valid for all values of $m$ and $\alpha \le 1$. In the limit $\alpha \to -\infty$ the network is homogeneous. If $\alpha &gt; 1$ there is a gel phase with $m$ super-connected nodes. It is proposed a formula for the clustering coefficient which is in good agreement with numerical simulations. The assortativity coefficient $r$ is determined and it is shown that the nonlinear Barab\'asi-Albert network is assortative (disassortative) if $\alpha &lt; 1$ ($\alpha &gt; 1$) and no assortative only when $\alpha = 1$. In the limit $\alpha \to -\infty$ the assortativity coefficient can be exactly calculated. We find $r=7/13$ when $m=2$. Finally, the minimum average shortest path length $l_{min}$ is numerically evaluated. Increasing the network size, $l_{min}$ diverges for $\alpha \le 1$ and it is equal to 1 when $\alpha &gt; 1$.

010       Problems with Fitting to the Power-Law Distribution
021       This short communication uses a simple experiment to show that fitting to a power law distribution by using graphical methods based on linear fit on the log-log scale is biased and inaccurate. 
020       It shows that using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is far more robust. Finally, it presents a new table for performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnof test for goodness-of-fit tailored to power-law distributions in which the power-law exponent is estimated using MLE. The techniques presented here will advance the application of complex network theory by allowing reliable estimation of power-law models from data and further allowing quantitative assessment of goodness-of-fit of proposed power-law models to empirical data.

021       A fast community detection algorithm based on a q-state Potts model is presented. 
020       Communities in networks (groups of densely interconnected nodes that are only loosely connected to the rest of the network) are found to coincide with the domains of equal spin value in the minima of a modified Potts spin glass Hamiltonian. Comparing global and local minima of the Hamiltonian allows for the detection of overlapping (``fuzzy'') communities and quantifying the association of nodes to multiple communities as well as the robustness of a community. No prior knowledge of the number of communities has to be assumed.

010       Wealth Dynamics on Complex Networks
021       We study a model of wealth dynamics [Bouchaud and M\'ezard 2000, \emph{Physica A} \textbf{282}, 536] which mimics transactions among economic agents. 
020       The outcomes of the model are shown to depend strongly on the topological properties of the underlying transaction network. The extreme cases of a fully connected and a fully disconnected network yield power-law and log-normal forms of the wealth distribution respectively. We perform numerical simulations in order to test the model on more complex network topologies. We show that the mixed form of most empirical distributions (displaying a non-smooth transition from a log-normal to a power-law form) can be traced back to a heterogeneous topology with varying link density, which on the other hand is a recently observed property of real networks.

Since the method detects efficiently clustered nodes in large networks even when these are not sharply partitioned, it turns to be specially suitable to the analysis of social and information networks. We test the algorithm on a large-scale data-set from a psychological experiment of word association. In this case, it proves to be successful both in clustering words and in uncovering mental association patterns.

010       Two complementary representations of a scale-free network
021       Several studies on real complex networks from different fields as biology, economy, or sociology have shown that the degree of nodes (number of edges connected to each node) follows a scale-free power-law distribution like $P(k)\approx k^{-\gamma}$, where $P(k)$ denotes the frequency of the nodes that are connected to $k$ other nodes. 
020       Here we have carried out a study on scale-free networks, where a line graph transformation (i.e., edges in an initial network are transformed into nodes) is applied to a power-law distribution. Our results indicate that a power-law distribution as $P(k)\approx k^{-\gamma +1}$ is found for the transformed network together with a peak for low-degree nodes. In the present work we show a parametrization of this behaviour and discuss its application to real networks as metabolic networks, protein-protein interaction network and World Wide Web.

010       The Spread of Infectious Disease with Household-Structure on the Complex   Networks
021       In this paper we study the household-structure SIS epidemic spreading on general complex networks. 
020       The household structure gives us the way to distinguish inner and the outer infection rate. Unlike household-structure models on homogenous networks, such as regular and random networks, here we consider heterogeneous networks with arbitrary degree distribution p(k). First we introduce the epidemic model. Then rate equations under mean field appropriation and computer simulations are used here to analyze our model. Some unique phenomena only existing in divergent network with household structure is found, while we also get some similar conclusions that some simple geometrical quantities of networks have important impression on infection property of infectous disease. It seems that in our model even when local cure rate is greater than inner infection rate in every household, disease still can spread on scale-free network. It implies that no disease is spreading in every single household, but for the whole network, disease is spreading. Since our society network seems like this structure, maybe this conclusion remind us that during disease spreading we should pay more attention on network structure than local cure condition.

021       This paper proposes and illustrates a general framework to integrate the areas of vision research and complex networks. 
020       Each image pixel is associated to a network node and the Euclidean distance between the visual properties (e.g. gray-level intensity, color or texture) at each possible pair of pixels is assigned as the respective edge weight. In addition to investigating the therefore obtained weight and adjacency matrices in terms of node degree densities, it is shown that the combination of the concepts of network hub and \emph{2-}expansion of the adjacency matrix provides an effective means to separate the image elements, a challenging task in computer vision known as segmentation.

010       Analysis of scale-free networks based on a threshold graph with   intrinsic vertex weights
021       Many real networks are complex and have power-law vertex degree distribution, short diameter, and high clustering. 
020       We analyze the network model based on thresholding of the summed vertex weights, which belongs to the class of networks proposed by Caldarelli et al. (2002). Power-law degree distributions, particularly with the dynamically stable scaling exponent 2, realistic clustering, and short path lengths are produced for many types of weight distributions. Thresholding mechanisms can underlie a family of real complex networks that is characterized by cooperativeness and the baseline scaling exponent 2. It contrasts with the class of growth models with preferential attachment, which is marked by competitiveness and baseline scaling exponent 3.

010       Temporal Series Analysis Approach to Spectra of Complex Networks
021       The spacing of nearest levels of the spectrum of a complex network can be regarded as a time series. 
020       Joint use of Multi-fractal Detrended Fluctuation Approach (MF-DFA) and Diffusion Entropy (DE) is employed to extract characteristics from this time series. For the WS (Watts and Strogatz) small-world model, there exist a critical point at rewiring probability . For a network generated in the range, the correlation exponent is in the range of . Above this critical point, all the networks behave similar with that at . For the ER model, the time series behaves like FBM (fractional Brownian motion) noise at . For the GRN (growing random network) model, the values of the long-range correlation exponent are in the range of . For most of the GRN networks the PDF of a constructed time series obeys a Gaussian form. In the joint use of MF-DFA and DE, the shuffling procedure in DE is essential to obtain a reliable result.

010       Modularity from Fluctuations in Random Graphs and Complex Networks
021       The mechanisms by which modularity emerges in complex networks are not well understood but recent reports have suggested that modularity may arise from evolutionary selection. 
020       We show that finding the modularity of a network is analogous to finding the ground-state energy of a spin system. Moreover, we demonstrate that, due to fluctuations, stochastic network models give rise to modular networks. Specifically, we show both numerically and analytically that random graphs and scale-free networks have modularity. We argue that this fact must be taken into consideration to define statistically-significant modularity in complex networks.

010       Two-Peak and Three-Peak Optimal Complex Networks
021       A central issue in complex networks is tolerance to random failures and intentional attacks. 
020       Current literature emphasizes the dichotomy between networks with a power-law node connectivity distribution, which are robust to random failures but fragile to targeted attacks, versus networks with an exponentially decaying connectivity distribution, which are less tolerant to failures but more resilient to attacks. We prove analytically that the optimal network configuration under a classic measure of robustness is altogether different from both of the above: in all cases, failure and/or attack, there are no more than three distinct node connectivities in the optimal network.

010       Scale-free trees: the skeletons of complex networks
021       We investigate the properties of the spanning trees of various real-world and model networks. 
020       The spanning tree representing the communication kernel of the original network is determined by maximizing total weight of edges, whose weights are given by the edge betweenness centralities. We find that a scale-free tree and shortcuts organize a complex network. The spanning tree shows robust betweenness centrality distribution that was observed in scale-free tree models. It turns out that the shortcut distribution characterizes the properties of original network, such as the clustering coefficient and the classification of networks by the betweenness centrality distribution.

010       Factors that predict better synchronizability on complex networks
021       While shorter characteristic path length has in general been believed to enhance synchronizability of a coupled oscillator system on a complex network,the suppressing tendency of the heterogeneity of the degree distribution, even for shorter characteristic path length, has also been reported. 
020       To see this, we investigate the effects of various factors such as the degree, characteristic path length, heterogeneity, and betweenness centrality on synchronization, and find a consistent trend between the synchronization and the betweenness centrality. The betweenness centrality is thus proposed as a good indicator for synchronizability.

010       Self Organized Scale-Free Networks from Merging and Regeneration
021       We consider the self organizing process of merging and regeneration of vertices in complex networks and demonstrate that a scale-free degree distribution emerges in a steady state of such a dynamics. 
020       The merging of neighbor vertices in a network may be viewed as an optimization of efficiency by minimizing redundancy. It is also a mechanism to shorten the distance and thus decrease signaling times between vertices in a complex network. Thus the merging process will in particular be relevant for networks where these issues related to global signaling are of concern.

010       Optimization of Robustness of Complex Networks
021       Networks with a given degree distribution may be very resilient to one type of failure or attack but not to another. 
020       The goal of this work is to determine network design guidelines which maximize the robustness of networks to both random failure and intentional attack while keeping the cost of the network (which we take to be the average number of links per node) constant. We find optimal parameters for: (i) scale free networks having degree distributions with a single power-law regime, (ii) networks having degree distributions with two power-law regimes, and (iii) networks described by degree distributions containing two peaks. Of these various kinds of distributions we find that the optimal network design is one in which all but one of the nodes have the same degree, $k_1$ (close to the average number of links per node), and one node is of very large degree, $k_2 \sim N^{2/3}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the network.

010       Detecting Network Communities: a new systematic and efficient algorithm
021       An efficient and relatively fast algorithm for the detection of communities in complex networks is introduced. 
020       The method exploits spectral properties of the graph Laplacian-matrix combined with hierarchical-clustering techniques, and includes a procedure to maximize the ``modularity'' of the output. Its performance is compared with that of other existing methods, as applied to different well-known instances of complex networks with a community-structure: both computer-generated and from the real-world. Our results are in all the tested cases, at least, as good as the best ones obtained with any other methods, and faster in most of the cases than methods providing similar-quality results. This converts the algorithm in a valuable computational tool for detecting and analyzing communities and modular structures in complex networks.

010       Modeling Interactome: Scale-Free or Geometric?
021       Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their behavior. 
020       Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have a correct model. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced. One example of large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We demonstrate that the currently popular scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in several respects. We show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data.

010       Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability for Pulsar Wind Nebulae in   expanding Supernova Remnants
021       We present a numerical investigation of the development of Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface between an expanding Pulsar Wind Nebula and its surrounding Supernova Remnant. 
020       These systems have long been thought to be naturally subject to this kind of instability, given their expansion behavior and the density jump at the contact discontinuity. High resolution images of the Crab Nebula at optical frequencies show the presence of a complex network of line-emitting filaments protruding inside the synchrotron nebula. These structures are interpreted as the observational evidence that Rayleigh-Taylor instability is in fact at work. The development of this instability in the regime appropriate to describe Supernova Remnant-Pulsar Wind Nebula systems is non-trivial. The conditions at the interface are likely close to the stability threshold, and the inclusion of the nebular magnetic field, which might play an important role in stabilizing the system, is essential to the modeling. If Rayleigh-Taylor features can grow efficiently a mixing layer in the outer portion of the nebula might form where most of the supernova material is confined. When a magnetic field close to equipartition is included we find that the interface is stable, and that even a weaker magnetic field affects substantially the growth and shape of the fingers.

020       After identifying the network nodes with highest degree (the so-called hubs), the network is flooded with wavefronts of labels emanating from the hubs, accounting for the identification of the involved communities. The simplicity and potential of this method, which is presented for direct/undirected and weighted/unweighted networks, is illustrated with respect to the Zachary karate club data, image segmentation, and concept association. Attention is also given to the identification of the boundaries between communities.

010       Effect of Disorder Strength on Optimal Paths in Complex Networks
021       We study the transition between the strong and weak disorder regimes in the scaling properties of the average optimal path $\ell_{\rm opt}$ in a disordered Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random network and scale-free (SF) network. 
020       Each link $i$ is associated with a weight $\tau_i\equiv\exp(a r_i)$, where $r_i$ is a random number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and the parameter $a$ controls the strength of the disorder. We find that for any finite $a$, there is a crossover network size $N^*(a)$ at which the transition occurs. For $N \ll N^*(a)$ the scaling behavior of $\ell_{\rm opt}$ is in the strong disorder regime, with $\ell_{\rm opt} \sim N^{1/3}$ for ER networks and for SF networks with $\lambda \ge 4$, and $\ell_{\rm opt} \sim N^{(\lambda-3)/(\lambda-1)}$ for SF networks with $3 &lt; \lambda &lt; 4$. For $N \gg N^*(a)$ the scaling behavior is in the weak disorder regime, with $\ell_{\rm opt}\sim\ln N$ for ER networks and SF networks with $\lambda &gt; 3$. In order to study the transition we propose a measure which indicates how close or far the disordered network is from the limit of strong disorder. We propose a scaling ansatz for this measure and demonstrate its validity. We proceed to derive the scaling relation between $N^*(a)$ and $a$. We find that $N^*(a)\sim a^3$ for ER networks and for SF networks with $\lambda\ge 4$, and $N^*(a)\sim a^{(\lambda-1)/(\lambda-3)}$ for SF networks with $3 &lt; \lambda &lt; 4$.

010       Minimum spanning trees on weighted scale-free networks
021       A complete understanding of real networks requires us to understand the consequences of the uneven interaction strengths between a system's components. 
020       Here we use the minimum spanning tree (MST) to explore the effect of weight assignment and network topology on the organization of complex networks. We find that if the weight distribution is correlated with the network topology, the MSTs are either scale-free or exponential. In contrast, when the correlations between weights and topology are absent, the MST degree distribution is a power-law and independent of the weight distribution. These results offer a systematic way to explore the impact of weak links on the structure and integrity of complex networks.

010       Coarse-Graining and Self-Dissimilarity of Complex Networks
021       Can complex engineered and biological networks be coarse-grained into smaller and more understandable versions in which each node represents an entire pattern in the original network? To address this, we define coarse-graining units (CGU) as connectivity patterns which can serve as the nodes of a coarse-grained network, and present algorithms to detect them. 
020       We use this approach to systematically reverse-engineer electronic circuits, forming understandable high-level maps from incomprehensible transistor wiring: first, a coarse-grained version in which each node is a gate made of several transistors is established. Then, the coarse-grained network is itself coarse-grained, resulting in a high-level blueprint in which each node is a circuit-module made of multiple gates. We apply our approach also to a mammalian protein-signaling network, to find a simplified coarse-grained network with three main signaling channels that correspond to cross-interacting MAP-kinase cascades. We find that both biological and electronic networks are 'self-dissimilar', with different network motifs found at each level. The present approach can be used to simplify a wide variety of directed and nondirected, natural and designed networks.

010       The large-scale organization of chemical reaction networks in   astrophysics
021       The large-scale organization of complex networks, both natural and artificial, has shown the existence of highly heterogeneous patterns of organization. 
020       Such patterns typically involve scale-free degree distributions and small world, modular architectures. One example is provided by chemical reaction networks, such as the metabolic pathways. The chemical reactions of the Earth's atmosphere have also been shown to give rise to a scale-free network. Here we present novel data analysis on the structure of several astrophysical networks including the chemistry of the planetary atmospheres and the interstellar medium. Our work reveals that Earth's atmosphere displays a hierarchical organization, close to the one observed in cellular webs. Instead, the other astrophysical reaction networks reveal a much simpler pattern consistent with an equilibrium state. The implications for large-scale regulation of the planetary dynamics are outlined.

021       We carry out a comparative study on the problem for a walker searching on several typical complex networks. 
020       The search efficiency is evaluated for various strategies. Having no knowledge of the global properties of the underlying networks and the optimal path between any two given nodes, it is found that the best search strategy is the self-avoid random walk. The preferentially self-avoid random walk does not help in improving the search efficiency further. In return, topological information of the underlying networks may be drawn by comparing the results of the different search strategies.

010       A comprehensive weighted evolving network model
021       Many social, technological, biological, and economical systems are best described by weighted networks, whose properties and dynamics depend not only on their structures but also on the connection weights among their nodes. 
020       However, most existing research work on complex network models are concentrated on network structures, with connection weights among their nodes being either 1 or 0. In this paper, we propose a new weighted evolving network model. Numerical simulations indicate that this network model yields three power-law distributions of the node degrees, connection weights and node strengths. Particularly, some other properties of the distributions, such as the droop-head and heavy-tail effects, can also be reflected by this model.

010       Modelling Selforganization and Innovation Processes in Networks
021       In this paper we develop a theory to describe innovation processes in a network of interacting units. 
020       We introduce a stochastic picture that allows for the clarification of the role of fluctuations for the survival of innovations in such a non-linear system. We refer to the theory of complex networks and introduce the notion of sensitive networks. Sensitive networks are networks in which the introduction or the removal of a node/vertex dramatically changes the dynamic structure of the system. As an application we consider interaction networks of firms and technologies and describe technological innovation as a specific dynamic process. Random graph theory, percolation, master equation formalism and the theory of birth and death processes are the mathematical instruments used in this paper.

010       Optimization of Network Robustness to Waves of Targeted and Random Attack
021       We study the robustness of complex networks to multiple waves of simultaneous (i) targeted attacks in which the highest degree nodes are removed and (ii) random attacks (or failures) in which fractions $p_t$ and $p_r$ respectively of the nodes are removed until the network collapses. 
020       We find that the network design which optimizes network robustness has a bimodal degree distribution, with a fraction $r$ of the nodes having degree $k_2= (\kav - 1 +r)/r$ and the remainder of the nodes having degree $k_1=1$, where $\kav$ is the average degree of all the nodes. We find that the optimal value of $r$ is of the order of $p_t/p_r$ for $p_t/p_r\ll 1$.

010       Complex networks created by aggregation
021       We study aggregation as a mechanism for the creation of complex networks. 
020       In this evolution process vertices merge together, which increases the number of highly connected hubs. We study a range of complex network architectures produced by the aggregation. Fat-tailed (in particular, scale-free) distributions of connections are obtained both for networks with a finite number of vertices and growing networks. We observe a strong variation of a network structure with growing density of connections and find the phase transition of the condensation of edges. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of structural correlations in these networks.

010       Spectral Analysis and the Dynamic Response of Complex Networks
021       The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix of complex networks contain information about its topology and its collective behavior. 
020       In particular, the spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of this matrix reveals important network characteristics: random networks follow Wigner's semicircular law whereas scale-free networks exhibit a triangular distribution. In this paper we show that the spectral density of hierarchical networks follow a very different pattern, which can be used as a fingerprint of modularity. Of particular importance is the value $\rho(0)$, related to the homeostatic response of the network: it is maximum for random and scale free networks but very small for hierarchical modular networks. It is also large for an actual biological protein-protein interaction network, demonstrating that the current leading model for such networks is not adequate.

010       Awaking and Sleeping a Complex Network
021       A network with local dynamics of logistic type is considered. 
020       We implement a mean-field multiplicative coupling among first-neighbor nodes. When the coupling parameter is small the dynamics is dissipated and there is no activity: the network is {\it turned off}. For a critical value of the coupling a non-null stable synchronized state, which represents a {\it turned on} network, emerges. This global bifurcation is independent of the network topology. We characterize the bistability of the system by studying how to perform the transition, which now is topology dependent, from the active state to that with no activity, for the particular case of a scale free network. This could be a naive model for the {\it wakening} and {\it sleeping} of a brain-like system.

010       Innovation flow through social networks: Productivity distribution
021       A detailed empirical analysis of the productivity of non financial firms across several countries and years shows that productivity follows a non-Gaussian distribution with power law tails. 
020       We demonstrate that these empirical findings can be interpreted as consequence of a mechanism of exchanges in a social network where firms improve their productivity by direct innovation or/and by imitation of other firm's technological and organizational solutions. The type of network-connectivity determines how fast and how efficiently information can diffuse and how quickly innovation will permeate or behaviors will be imitated. From a model for innovation flow through a complex network we obtain that the expectation values of the productivity level are proportional to the connectivity of the network of links between firms. The comparison with the empirical distributions reveals that such a network must be of a scale-free type with a power-law degree distribution in the large connectivity range.

010       Fluctuations of Complex Networks: Electrical Properties of Single   Protein Nanodevices
021       We present for the first time a complex network approach to the study of the electrical properties of single protein devices. 
020       In particular, we consider an electronic nanobiosensor based on a G-protein coupled receptor. By adopting a coarse grain description, the protein is modeled as a complex network of elementary impedances. The positions of the alpha-carbon atoms of each amino acid are taken as the nodes of the network. The amino acids are assumed to interact electrically among them. Consequently, a link is drawn between any pair of nodes neighboring in space within a given distance and an elementary impedance is associated with each link. The value of this impedance can be related to the physical and chemical properties of the amino acid pair and to their relative distance. Accordingly, the conformational changes of the receptor induced by the capture of the ligand, are translated into a variation of its electrical properties. Stochastic fluctuations in the value of the elementary impedances of the network, which mimic different physical effects, have also been considered. Preliminary results concerning the impedance spectrum of the network and its fluctuations are presented and discussed for different values of the model parameters.

010       Michaelis-Menten Dynamics in Complex Heterogeneous Networks
021       Biological networks have been recently found to exhibit many topological properties of the so-called complex networks. 
020       It has been reported that they are, in general, both highly skewed and directed. In this paper, we report on the dynamics of a Michaelis-Menten like model when the topological features of the underlying network resemble those of real biological networks. Specifically, instead of using a random graph topology, we deal with a complex heterogeneous network characterized by a power-law degree distribution coupled to a continuous dynamics for each network's component. The dynamics of the model is very rich and stationary, periodic and chaotic states are observed upon variation of the model's parameters. We characterize these states numerically and report on several quantities such as the system's phase diagram and size distributions of clusters of stationary, periodic and chaotic nodes. The results are discussed in view of recent debate about the ubiquity of complex networks in nature and on the basis of several biological processes that can be well described by the dynamics studied.

010       The statistical mechanics of complex signaling networks : nerve growth   factor signaling
021       It is becoming increasingly appreciated that the signal transduction systems used by eukaryotic cells to achieve a variety of essential responses represent highly complex networks rather than simple linear pathways. 
020       While significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these signaling networks, many of the parameters required to describe the behavior of these systems remain unknown, or at best, estimates. With these goals and caveats in mind, we use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods towards modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. Using our approach, we are able to extract predictions that are highly specific and accurate, thereby enabling us to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. We show that extracting biologically relevant predictions from complex signaling models appears to be possible even in the absence of measurements of all the individual rate constants. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems wherein particular ''soft'' combinations of parameters can be varied over wide ranges without impacting the final output and demonstrating that a few ''stiff'' parameter combinations center around the paramount regulatory steps of the network. We refer to this property -- which is distinct from robustness -- as ''sloppiness.''

010       Hide and seek on complex networks
021       Signaling pathways and networks determine the ability to communicate in systems ranging from living cells to human society. 
020       We investigate how the network structure constrains communication in social-, man-made and biological networks. We find that human networks of governance and collaboration are predictable on teat-a-teat level, reflecting well defined pathways, but globally inefficient. In contrast, the Internet tends to have better overall communication abilities, more alternative pathways, and is therefore more robust. Between these extremes the molecular network of Saccharomyces cerevisea is more similar to the simpler social systems, whereas the pattern of interactions in the more complex Drosophilia melanogaster, resembles the robust Internet.

010       Do extremists impose the structure of social networks?
021       The structure and the properties of complex networks essentially depend on the way how nodes get connected to each other. 
020       We assume here that each node has a feature which attracts the others. We model the situation by assigning two numbers to each node, \omega and \alpha, where \omega indicates some property of the node and \alpha the affinity towards that property. A node A is more likely to establish a connection with a node B if B has a high value of \omega and A has a high value of \alpha. Simple computer simulations show that networks built according to this principle have a degree distribution with a power law tail, whose exponent is determined only by the nodes with the largest value of the affinity \alpha (the "extremists"). This means that the extremists lead the formation process of the network and manage to shape the final topology of the system. The latter phenomenon may have implications in the study of social networks and in epidemiology.

010       Diffusion-annihilation processes in complex networks
021       We present a detailed analytical study of the $A+A\to\emptyset$ diffusion-annihilation process in complex networks. 
020       By means of microscopic arguments, we derive a set of rate equations for the density of $A$ particles in vertices of a given degree, valid for any generic degree distribution, and which we solve for uncorrelated networks. For homogeneous networks (with bounded fluctuations), we recover the standard mean-field solution, i.e. a particle density decreasing as the inverse of time. For heterogeneous (scale-free networks) in the infinite network size limit, we obtain instead a density decreasing as a power-law, with an exponent depending on the degree distribution. We also analyze the role of finite size effects, showing that any finite scale-free network leads to the mean-field behavior, with a prefactor depending on the network size. We check our analytical predictions with extensive numerical simulations on homogeneous networks with Poisson degree distribution and scale-free networks with different degree exponents.

021       The spreading (propagation) of diseases, viruses, and disasters such as power blackout through a huge-scale and complex network is one of the most concerned issues today. 
020       In this paper, we study the control of such spreading in a nonlinear spreading model of small-world networks. We found that the short-cut adding probability $p$ in the N-W model \cite{N-W:1999} of small-world networks determines the Hopf bifurcation and other bifurcating behaviors in the proposed model. We further show a control technique that stabilize a periodic spreading behavior onto a stable equilibrium over the proposed model of small-world networks.

021       We introduce evolving networks where new vertices preferentially connect to the more central parts of a network. 
020       This makes such networks compact. Finite networks grown under the preferential compactness mechanism have complex architectures, but infinite ones tend towards the opposite, having rapidly decreasing distributions of connections. We present an analytical solution of the problem for tree-like networks. Our approach links a collective self-optimization mechanism of the emergence of complex network architectures to self-organization mechanisms.

020       degree sequence of which the tail of the distribution function $F$ is regularly varying with exponent $\tau\in (1,2)$. Thus, the degrees have infinite mean. Such random graphs can serve as models for complex networks where degree power laws are observed. <br />The minimal number of edges between two arbitrary nodes, also called the graph distance or the hopcount, in a graph with $N$ nodes is investigated when $N\to \infty$. The paper is part of a sequel of three papers. The other two papers study the case where $\tau \in (2,3)$, and $\tau \in (3,\infty),$ respectively. <br />The main result of this paper is that the graph distance converges for $\tau\in (1,2)$ to a limit random variable with probability mass exclusively on the points 2 and 3. We also consider the case where we condition the degrees to be at most $N^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha&gt;0.$ For $\tau^{-1}&lt;\alpha&lt;(\tau-1)^{-1}$, the hopcount converges to 3 in probability, while for $\alpha&gt;(\tau-1)^{-1}$, the hopcount converges to the same limit as for the unconditioned degrees. Our results give convincing asymptotics for the hopcount when the mean degree is infinite, using extreme value theory.

020       Here we investigate degree correlations of the Barabasi-Albert (BA) Scale-Free model with both analytical results and simulations, and find two neighboring regions, a disassortative one for low degrees and a neutral one for high degrees. The average degree of the neighbors of a randomly picked node is expected to diverge in the limit of infinite network size. As an generalization of the concept of correlation, we also study the correlations of other scalar properties, including age and clustering coefficient. Finally we propose a correlation measurement in bipartite networks.

010       A Generalized Approach to Complex Networks
021       This work describes how the formalization of complex network concepts in terms of discrete mathematics, especially mathematical morphology, allows a series of generalizations and important results ranging from new measurements of the network topology to new network growth models. 
020       First, the concepts of node degree and clustering coefficient are extended in order to characterize not only specific nodes, but any generic subnetwork. Second, the consideration of distance transform and rings are used to further extend those concepts in order to obtain a signature, instead of a single scalar measurement, ranging from the single node to whole graph scales. The enhanced discriminative potential of such extended measurements is illustrated with respect to the identification of correspondence between nodes in two complex networks, namely a protein-protein interaction network and a perturbed version of it. The use of other measurements derived from mathematical morphology are also suggested as a means to characterize complex networks connectivity in a more comprehensive fashion.

010       Conservation laws for the voter model in complex networks
021       We consider the voter model dynamics in random networks with an arbitrary distribution of the degree of the nodes. 
020       We find that for the usual node-update dynamics the average magnetization is not conserved, while an average magnetization weighted by the degree of the node is conserved. However, for a link-update dynamics the average magnetization is still conserved. For the particular case of a Barabasi-Albert scale-free network the voter model dynamics leads to a partially ordered metastable state with a finite size survival time. This characteristic time scales linearly with system size only when the updating rule respects the conservation law of the average magnetization. This scaling identifies a universal or generic property of the voter model dynamics associated with the conservation law of the magnetization.

020       We propose and analyze a model capable to generate random uncorrelated scale-free networks with no multiple and self-connections. The model is based on the classical configuration model, with an additional restriction on the maximum possible degree of the vertices. We check numerically that the proposed model indeed generates scale-free networks with no two and three vertex correlations, as measured by the average degree of the nearest neighbors and the clustering coefficient of the vertices of degree $k$, respectively.

010       Modular synchronization in complex networks
021       We study the synchronization transition (ST) of a modified Kuramoto model on two different types of modular complex networks. 
020       It is found that the ST depends on the type of inter-modular connections. For the network with decentralized (centralized) inter-modular connections, the ST occurs at finite coupling constant (behaves abnormally). Such distinct features are found in the yeast protein interaction network and the Internet, respectively. Moreover, by applying the finite-size scaling analysis to an artificial network with decentralized inter-modular connections, we obtain the exponent associated with the order parameter of the ST to be $\beta \approx 1$ different from $\beta_{\rm MF} \approx 1/2$ obtained from the scale-free network with the same degree distribution but the absence of modular structure, corresponding to the mean field value.

010       The topological relationship between the large-scale attributes and   local interaction patterns of complex networks
021       Recent evidence indicates that the abundance of recurring elementary interaction patterns in complex networks, often called subgraphs or motifs, carry significant information about their function and overall organization. 
020       Yet, the underlying reasons for the variable quantity of different subgraph types, their propensity to form clusters, and their relationship with the networks' global organization remain poorly understood. Here we show that a network's large-scale topological organization and its local subgraph structure mutually define and predict each other, as confirmed by direct measurements in five well studied cellular networks. We also demonstrate the inherent existence of two distinct classes of subgraphs, and show that, in contrast to the low-density type II subgraphs, the highly abundant type I subgraphs cannot exist in isolation but must naturally aggregate into subgraph clusters. The identified topological framework may have important implications for our understanding of the origin and function of subgraphs in all complex networks.

010       Complex Networks on Hyperbolic Surfaces
021       We explore a novel method to generate and characterize complex networks by means of their embedding on hyperbolic surfaces. 
020       Evolution through local elementary moves allows the exploration of the ensemble of networks which share common embeddings and consequently share similar hierarchical properties. This method provides a new perspective to classify network-complexity both on local and global scale. We demonstrate by means of several examples that there is a strong relation between the network properties and the embedding surface.

010       Characterization and Modeling of weighted networks
021       We review the main tools which allow for the statistical characterization of weighted networks. 
020       We then present two case studies, the airline connection network and the scientific collaboration network, which are representative of critical infrastructures and social systems, respectively. The main empirical results are (i) the broad distributions of various quantities and (ii) the existence of weight-topology correlations. These measurements show that weights are relevant and that in general the modeling of complex networks must go beyond topology. We review a model which provides an explanation for the features observed in several real-world networks. This model of weighted network formation relies on the dynamical coupling between topology and weights, considering the rearrangement of weights when new links are introduced in the system.

010       Universality Class of Fiber Bundle Model on Complex Networks
021       We investigate the failure characteristics of complex networks within the framework of the fiber bundle model subject to the local load sharing rule in which the load of the broken fiber is transferred only to its neighbor fibers. 
020       Although the load sharing is strictly local, it is found that the critical behavior belongs to the universality class of the global load sharing where the load is transferred equally to all fibers in the system. From the numerical simulations and the analytical approach applied to the microscopic behavior, it is revealed that the emergence of a single dominant hub cluster of broken fibers causes the global load sharing effect in the failure process.

010       Intensity and coherence of motifs in weighted complex networks
021       The local structure of unweighted networks can be characterized by the number of times a subgraph appears in the network. 
020       The clustering coefficient, reflecting the local configuration of triangles, can be seen as a special case of this approach. In this Letter we generalize this method for weighted networks. We introduce subgraph intensity as the geometric mean of its link weights and coherence as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.

010       Entropy Maximization as a Holistic Design Principle for Complex Optimal   Networks and the Emergence of Power Laws
021       We present a general holistic theory for the organization of complex networks, both human-engineered and naturally-evolved. 
020       Introducing concepts of value of interactions and satisfaction as generic network performance measures, we show that the underlying organizing principle is to meet an overall performance target for wide-ranging operating or environmental conditions. This design or survival requirement of reliable performance under uncertainty leads, via the maximum entropy principle, to the emergence of a power law vertex degree distribution. The theory also predicts exponential or Poisson degree distributions depending on network redundancy, thus explaining all three regimes as different manifestations of a common underlying phenomenon within a unified theoretical framework.

010       Complex networks of earthquakes and aftershocks
021       We invoke a metric to quantify the correlation between any two earthquakes. 
020       This provides a simple and straightforward alternative to using space-time windows to detect aftershock sequences and obviates the need to distinguish main shocks from aftershocks. Directed networks of earthquakes are constructed by placing a link, directed from the past to the future, between pairs of events that are strongly correlated. Each link has a weight giving the relative strength of correlation such that the sum over the incoming links to any node equals unity for aftershocks, or zero if the event had no correlated predecessors. A correlation threshold is set to drastically reduce the size of the data set without losing significant information. Events can be aftershocks of many previous events, and also generate many aftershocks. The probability distribution for the number of incoming and outgoing links are both scale free, and the networks are highly clustered. The Omori law holds for aftershock rates up to a decorrelation time that scales with the magnitude, $m$, of the initiating shock as $t_{\rm cutoff} \sim 10^{\beta m}$ with $\beta \simeq 3/4$. Another scaling law relates distances between earthquakes and their aftershocks to the magnitude of the initiating shock. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of finite aftershock zones. We also find evidence that seismicity is dominantly triggered by small earthquakes. Our approach, using concepts from the modern theory of complex networks, together with a metric to estimate correlations, opens up new avenues of research, as well as new tools to understand seismicity.

010       Recurrent epidemics in small world networks
021       The effect of spatial correlations on the spread of infectious diseases was investigated using a stochastic SIR (Susceptible-Infective-Recovered) model on complex networks. 
020       It was found that in addition to the reduction of the effective transmission rate, through the screening of infectives, spatial correlations may have another major effect through the enhancement of stochastic fluctuations. As a consequence large populations will have to become even larger to 'average out' significant differences from the solution of deterministic models. Furthermore, time series of the (unforced) model provide patterns of recurrent epidemics with slightly irregular periods and realistic amplitudes, suggesting that stochastic models together with complex networks of contacts may be sufficient to describe the long term dynamics of some diseases. The spatial effects were analysed quantitatively by modelling measles and pertussis, using a SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered) model. Both the period and the spatial coherence of the epidemic peaks of pertussis are well described by the unforced model for realistic values of the parameters.

010       Inferring Network Mechanisms: The Drosophila melanogaster Protein   Interaction Network
021       Naturally occurring networks exhibit quantitative features revealing underlying growth mechanisms. 
020       Numerous network mechanisms have recently been proposed to reproduce specific properties such as degree distributions or clustering coefficients. We present a method for inferring the mechanism most accurately capturing a given network topology, exploiting discriminative tools from machine learning. The Drosophila melanogaster protein network is confidently and robustly (to noise and training data subsampling) classified as a duplication-mutation-complementation network over preferential attachment, small-world, and other duplication-mutation mechanisms. Systematic classification, rather than statistical study of specific properties, provides a discriminative approach to understand the design of complex networks.

010       Effect of congestion costs on shortest paths through complex networks
021       We analyze analytically the effect of congestion costs within a physically relevant, yet exactly solvable network model featuring central hubs. 
020       These costs lead to a competition between centralized and decentralized transport pathways. In stark contrast to conventional no-cost networks, there now exists an optimal number of connections to the central hub in order to minimize the shortest path. Our results shed light on an open problem in biology, informatics and sociology, concerning the extent to which decentralized versus centralized design benefits real-world complex networks.

010       Geographical Coarsegraining of Complex Networks
021       We perform the renormalization-group-like numerical analysis of geographically embedded complex networks on the two-dimensional square lattice. 
020       At each step of coarsegraining procedure, the four vertices on each $2 \times 2$ square box are merged to a single vertex, resulting in the coarsegrained system of the smaller sizes. Repetition of the process leads to the observation that the coarsegraining procedure does not alter the qualitative characteristics of the original scale-free network, which opens the possibility of subtracting a smaller network from the original network without destroying the important structural properties. The implication of the result is also suggested in the context of the recent study of the human brain functional network.

010       A Group-Based Yule Model for Bipartite Author-Paper Networks
021       This paper presents a novel model for author-paper networks, which is based on the assumption that authors are organized into groups and that, for each research topic, the number of papers published by a group is based on a success-breeds-success model. 
020       Collaboration between groups is modeled as random invitations from a group to an outside member. To analyze the model, a number of different metrics that can be obtained in author-paper networks were extracted. A simulation example shows that this model can effectively mimic the behavior of a real-world author-paper network, extracted from a collection of 900 journal papers in the field of complex networks.

010       Vulnerability and Hierarchy of Complex Networks
021       We suggest an approach to study hierarchy, especially hidden one, of complex networks based on the analysis of their vulnerability. 
020       Two quantities are proposed as a measure of network hierarchy. The first one is the system vulnerability V. We show that being quite suitable for regular networks this characteristic does not allow one to estimate the hierarchy of large random networks. The second quantity is a relative variance h of the system vulnerability that allows us to characterize a "natural" hierarchy level of random networks. We find that hierarchical properties of random networks depend crucially on a ratio between the number of nodes and the number of edges. We note that any graph with a transitive isometry group action (i.e. an absolutely symmetric graph) is not hierarchical. Breaking such a symmetry leads to appearance of hierarchy.

010       Complex network study of Brazilian soccer players
021       Although being a very popular sport in many countries, soccer has not received much attention from the scientific community. 
020       In this paper, we study soccer from a complex network point of view. First, we consider a bipartite network with two kinds of vertices or nodes: the soccer players and the clubs. Real data were gathered from the 32 editions of the Brazilian soccer championship, in a total of $13,411$ soccer players and 127 clubs. We find a lot of interesting and perhaps unsuspected results. The probability that a Brazilian soccer player has worked at $N$ clubs or played $M$ games shows an exponential decay while the probability that he has scored $G$ goals is power law. Now, if two soccer players who have worked at the same club at the same time are connected by an edge, then a new type of network arises (composed exclusively by soccer players nodes). Our analysis shows that for this network the degree distribution decays exponentially. We determine the exact values of the clustering coefficient, the assortativity coefficient and the average shortest path length and compare them with those of the Erd\"os-R\'enyi and configuration model. The time evolution of these quantities are calculated and the corresponding results discussed.

021       We study a novel model for evolution of complex networks. 
020       We introduce information filtering for reduction of the number of available nodes to a randomly chosen sample, as stochastic component of evolution. New nodes are attached to the nodes that have maximal degree in the sample, which is a deterministic component of network evolution process. This fact is a novel for evolution of scale free networks and depicts a possible new route for modeling network growth. We present both simulational and theoretical results for network evolution. The obtained degree distributions exhibit an obvious power-law behavior in the middle with the exponential cut off in the end. This highlights the essential characteristics of information filtering in the network growth mechanisms.

010       Analysis of the Airport Network of India as a complex weighted network
021       Transportation infrastructure of a country is one of the most important indicators of its economic growth. 
020       Here we study the Airport Network of India (ANI), which represents India's domestic civil aviation infrastructure, as a complex network. We find that ANI, a network of domestic airports connected by air links, is a small-world network characterized by a truncated power-law degree distribution, and has a signature of hierarchy. We investigate ANI as a weighted network to explore its various properties and compare them with their topological counterparts. The traffic in ANI, as in the World-wide Airport Network (WAN), is found to be accumulated on interconnected groups of airports and is concentrated between large airports. In contrast to WAN, ANI is found to be having disassortative mixing which is offset by the traffic dynamics. The analysis indicates toward possible mechanism of formation of a national transportation network, which is different from that on a global scale.

021       We analyze the process of informational exchange through complex networks by measuring network efficiencies. 
020       Aiming to study non-clustered systems, we propose a modification of this measure on the local level. We apply this method to an extension of the class of small-worlds that includes {\it declustered} networks, and show that they are locally quite efficient, although their clustering coefficient is practically zero. Unweighted systems with small-world and scale-free topologies are shown to be both globally and locally efficient. Our method is also applied to characterize weighted networks. In particular we examine the properties of underground transportation systems of Madrid and Barcelona and reinterpret the results obtained for the Boston subway network.

010       Load distribution in weighted complex networks
021       We study the load distribution in weighted networks by measuring the effective number of optimal paths passing through a given vertex. 
020       The optimal path, along which the total cost is minimum, crucially depend on the cost distribution function $p_c(c)$. In the strong disorder limit, where $p_c(c)\sim c^{-1}$, the load distribution follows a power law both in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) random graphs and in the scale-free (SF) networks, and its characteristics are determined by the structure of the minimum spanning tree. The distribution of loads at vertices with a given vertex degree also follows the SF nature similar to the whole load distribution, implying that the global transport property is not correlated to the local structural information. Finally, we measure the effect of disorder by the correlation coefficient between vertex degree and load, finding that it is larger for ER networks than for SF networks.

010       Degree-dependent intervertex separation in complex networks
021       We study the mean length $\ell(k)$ of the shortest paths between a vertex of degree $k$ and other vertices in growing networks, where correlations are essential. 
020       In a number of deterministic scale-free networks we observe a power-law correction to a logarithmic dependence, $\ell(k) = A\ln [N/k^{(\gamma-1)/2}] - C k^{\gamma-1}/N + ...$ in a wide range of network sizes. Here $N$ is the number of vertices in the network, $\gamma$ is the degree distribution exponent, and the coefficients $A$ and $C$ depend on a network. We compare this law with a corresponding $\ell(k)$ dependence obtained for random scale-free networks growing through the preferential attachment mechanism. In stochastic and deterministic growing trees with an exponential degree distribution, we observe a linear dependence on degree, $\ell(k) \cong A\ln N - C k$. We compare our findings for growing networks with those for uncorrelated graphs.

010       Evolutionary Dynamics in Complex Networks of Competing Boolean Agents
021       We investigate the dynamics of network minority games on Kauffman's NK networks (Kauffman nets), growing directed networks (GDNets), as well as growing directed networks with a small fraction of link reversals (GDRNets). 
020       We show that the dynamics and the associated phase structure of the game depend crucially on the structure of the underlying network. The dynamics on GDNets is very stable for all values of the connection number $K$, in contrast to the dynamics on Kauffman's NK networks, which becomes chaotic when $K&gt;K_c=2$. The dynamics of GDRNets, on the other hand, is near critical. Under a simple evolutionary scheme, the network system with a "near" critical dynamics evolves to a high level of global coordination among its agents. In particular, the performance of the system is close to the optimum for the GDRNets; this suggests that criticality leads to the best performance. For Kauffman nets with $K&gt;3$, the evolutionary scheme has no effect on the dynamics (it remains chaotic) and the performance of the MG resembles that of a random choice game (RCG).

010       A topological approach to neural complexity
021       Considerable efforts in modern statistical physics is devoted to the study of networked systems. 
020       One of the most important example of them is the brain, which creates and continuously develops complex networks of correlated dynamics. An important quantity which captures fundamental aspects of brain network organization is the neural complexity C(X)introduced by Tononi et al. This work addresses the dependence of this measure on the topological features of a network in the case of gaussian stationary process. Both anlytical and numerical results show that the degree of complexity has a clear and simple meaning from a topological point of view. Moreover the analytical result offers a straightforward algorithm to compute the complexity than the standard one.

010       A Time-Varying Complex Dynamical Network Model And Its Controlled   Synchronization Criteria
021       Today, complex networks have attracted increasing attention from various fields of science and engineering. 
020       It has been demonstrated that many complex networks display various synchronization phenomena. In this paper, we introduce a time-varying complex dynamical network model. We then further investigate its synchronization phenomenon and prove several network synchronization theorems. Especially, we show that synchronization of such a time-varying dynamical network is completely determined by the inner-coupling matrix, and the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the coupling configuration matrix of the network.

010       Anomalous Transport in Complex Networks
021       To study transport properties of complex networks, we analyze the equivalent conductance $G$ between two arbitrarily chosen nodes of random scale-free networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$ in which each link has the same unit resistance. 
020       We predict a broad range of values of $G$, with a power-law tail distribution $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)\sim G^{-g_G}$, where $g_G=2\lambda -1$, and confirm our predictions by simulations. The power-law tail in $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)$ leads to large values of $G$, thereby significantly improving the transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs where the tail of the conductivity distribution decays exponentially. Based on a simple physical ``transport backbone'' picture we show that the conductances are well approximated by $ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B)$ for any pair of nodes $A$ and $B$ with degrees $k_A$ and $k_B$. Thus, a single parameter $c$ characterizes transport on scale-free networks.

010       Dynamics of jamming transitions in complex networks
021       We numerically investigate jamming transitions in complex heterogeneous networks. 
020       Inspired by Internet routing protocols, we study a general model that incorporates local traffic information through a tunable parameter. The results show that whether the transition from a low-traffic regime to a congested phase is of first or second order type is determined by the protocol at work. The microscopic dynamics reveals that these two radically different behaviors are due to the way in which traffic jams propagate through the network. Our results are discussed in the context of Internet dynamics and other transport processes that take place on complex networks and provide insights for the design of routing policies based on traffic awareness in communication systems.

We further discuss how the ability to locate specific nodes can be improved if information associated to the overall traffic in the network is available.

010       Clustering Evolutionary Stock Market Model
021       As a typical representation of complex networks studied relatively thoroughly, financial market presents some special details, such as its nonconservation and opinions spreading. 
020       In this model, agents congregate to form some clusters, which may grow or collapse with the evolution of the system. To mimic an open market, we allow some ones participate in or exit the market suggesting that the number of the agents would fluctuate. Simulation results show that the large events are frequent in the fluctuations of the stock price generated by the artificial stock market when compared with a normal process and the price return distribution is a \emph{l\'{e}vy} distribution in the central part followed by an approximately exponential truncation.

010       Computing communities in large networks using random walks
021       Dense subgraphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. 
020       Computing them however is generally expensive. We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, it works at various scales, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm which runs in time O(mn^2) and space O(n^2) in the worst case, and in time O(n^2log n) and space O(n^2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time. This is very promising because our algorithm can be improved in several ways, which we sketch at the end of the paper.

021       Clustering is well-known to play a prominent role in the description and understanding of complex networks, and a large spectrum of tools and ideas have been introduced to this end. 
020       In particular, it has been recognized that the abundance of small subgraphs is important. Here, we study the arrangement of triangles in a model for scale-free random graphs and determine the asymptotic behavior of the clustering coefficient, the average number of triangles, as well as the number of triangles attached to the vertex of maximum degree. We prove that triangles are power-law distributed among vertices and characterized by both vertex and edge coagulation when the degree exponent satisfies $2&lt;\beta&lt;2.5$; furthermore, a finite density of triangles appears as $\beta=2+1/3$.

010       Self-avoiding walks on scale-free networks
021       Several kinds of walks on complex networks are currently used to analyze search and navigation in different systems. 
020       Many analytical and computational results are known for random walks on such networks. Self-avoiding walks (SAWs) are expected to be more suitable than unrestricted random walks to explore various kinds of real-life networks. Here we study long-range properties of random SAWs on scale-free networks, characterized by a degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$. In the limit of large networks (system size $N \to \infty$), the average number $s_n$ of SAWs starting from a generic site increases as $\mu^n$, with $\mu = &lt; k^2 &gt; / &lt; k &gt; - 1$. For finite $N$, $s_n$ is reduced due to the presence of loops in the network, which causes the emergence of attrition of the paths. For kinetic growth walks, the average maximum length, $&lt; L &gt;$, increases as a power of the system size: $&lt; L &gt; \sim N^{\alpha}$, with an exponent $\alpha$ increasing as the parameter $\gamma$ is raised. We discuss the dependence of $\alpha$ on the minimum allowed degree in the network. A similar power-law dependence is found for the mean self-intersection length of non-reversal random walks. Simulation results support our approximate analytical calculations.

010       Synchronization in scale-free network with asymmetric coupling

010       Hierarchical characterization of complex networks
021       While the majority of approaches to the characterization of complex networks has relied on measurements considering only the immediate neighborhood of each network node, valuable information about the network topological properties can be obtained by considering further neighborhoods. 
020       The current work discusses on how the concepts of hierarchical node degree and hierarchical clustering coefficient (introduced in <a href="/abs/cond-mat/0408076">cond-mat/0408076</a>), complemented by new hierarchical measurements, can be used in order to obtain a powerful set of topological features of complex networks. The interpretation of such measurements is discussed, including an analytical study of the hierarchical node degree for random networks, and the potential of the suggested measurements for the characterization of complex networks is illustrated with respect to simulations of random, scale-free and regular network models as well as real data (airports, proteins and word associations). The enhanced characterization of the connectivity provided by the set of hierarchical measurements also allows the use of agglomerative clustering methods in order to obtain taxonomies of relationships between nodes in a network, a possibility which is also illustrated in the current article.

010       The Dynamics of Book Sales: Endogenous versus Exogenous Shocks in   Complex Networks
021       We present an extensive study of the foreshock and aftershock signatures accompanying peaks of book sales. 
020       The time series of book sales are derived from the ranking system of Amazon.com. We present two independent ways of classifying peaks, one based on the acceleration pattern of sales and the other based on the exponent of the relaxation. They are found to be consistent and reveal the co-existence of two types of sales peaks: exogenous peaks occur abruptly and are followed by a power law relaxation, while endogenous sale peaks occur after a progressively accelerating power law growth followed by an approximately symmetrical power law relaxation which is slower than for exogenous peaks. We develop a simple epidemic model of buyers connected within a network of acquaintances which propagates rumors and opinions on books. The comparison between the predictions of the model and the empirical data confirms the validity of the model and suggests in addition that social networks have evolved to converge very close to criticality (here in the sense of critical branching processes of opinion spreading). We test in details the evidence for a power law distribution of book sales and confirm a previous indirect study suggesting that the fraction of books (density distribution) $P(S)$ of sales S is a power law P(S) ~ 1/S^{1+mu} with mu close to 2.

010       Sznajd Complex Networks
021       The Sznajd cellular automata corresponds to one of the simplest and yet most interesting models of complex systems. 
020       While the traditional two-dimensional Sznajd model tends to a consensus state (pro or cons), the assignment of the contrary to the dominant opinion to some of its cells during the system evolution is known to provide stabilizing feedback implying the overall system state to oscillate around null magnetization. The current article presents a novel type of geographic complex network model whose connections follow an associated feedbacked Sznajd model, i.e. the Sznajd dynamics is run over the network edges. Only connections not exceeding a maximum Euclidean distance $D$ are considered, and any two nodes within such a distance are randomly selected and, in case they are connected, all network nodes which are no further than $D$ are connected to them. In case they are not connected, all nodes within that distance are disconnected from them. Pairs of nodes are then randomly selected and assigned to the contrary of the dominant connectivity. The topology of the complex networks obtained by such a simple growth scheme, which are typically characterized by patches of connected communities, is analyzed both at global and individual levels in terms of a set of hierarchical measurements introduced recently. A series of interesting properties are identified and discussed comparatively to random and scale-free models with the same number of nodes and similar connectivity.

Possible implications for neuronal networks topology and dynamics are also discussed.

021       In many complex systems, for the activity f(i) of the constituents or nodes i, a power-law relationship was discovered between the standard deviation sigma(i) and the average strength of the activity: sigma(i) ~ &lt;f(i)&gt;^alpha; universal values alpha = 1/2 or 1 were found, however, with exceptions. 
020       With the help of an impact variable we introduce a random walk model where the activity is the product of the number of visitors at a node and their impact. If the impact depends strongly on the node connectivity and the properties of the carrying network are broadly distributed (like in a scale free network) we find both analytically and numerically non-universal alpha values. The exponent always crosses over to the universal value of 1 if the external drive dominates.

010       The inhomogeneous evolution of subgraphs and cycles in complex networks
021       Subgraphs and cycles are often used to characterize the local properties of complex networks. 
020       Here we show that the subgraph structure of real networks is highly time dependent: as the network grows, the density of some subgraphs remains unchanged, while the density of others increase at a rate that is determined by the network's degree distribution and clustering properties. This inhomogeneous evolution process, supported by direct measurements on several real networks, leads to systematic shifts in the overall subgraph spectrum and to an inevitable overrepresentation of some subgraphs and cycles.

010       Analytic formula for hidden variable distribution: Complex networks   arising from fluctuating random graphs
021       In analogy to superstatistics, which connects Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics to its generalizations through temperature fluctuations, complex networks are constructed from the fluctuating Erdos-Renyi random graphs. 
020       Here, using the quantum mechanical method, the exact analytic formula is presented for the hidden variable distribution, which describes the fluctuation and generates a generic degree distribution through the Poisson transformation. As an example, a static scale-free network is discussed and the corresponding hidden variable distribution is found to decay as a power law.

010       Sznajd model with synchronous updating on complex networks
021       We analyze the evolution of Sznajd Model with synchronous updating in several complex networks. 
020       Similar to the model on square lattice, we have found a transition between the state with no-consensus and the state with complete consensus in several complex networks. Furthermore, by adjusting the network parameters, we find that a large clustering coefficient favors development of a consensus. In particular, in the limit of large system size with the initial concentration p=0.5 of opinion +1, a consensus seems to be never reached for the Watts-Strogatz small-world network, when we fix the connectivity k and the rewiring probability p_s; nor for the scale-free network, when we fix the minimum node degree m and the triad formation step probability p_t.

010       Coherence in complex networks of oscillators
021       We study fully synchronized (coherent) states in complex networks of chaotic oscillators, reviewing the analytical approach of determining the stability conditions for synchronizability and comparing them with numerical criteria. 
020       As an example, we present detailed results for networks of chaotic logistic maps having three different scale-free topologies: random scale-free topology, deterministic pseudo-fractal scale-free network and Apollonian network. For random scale-free topology we find that the lower boundary of the synchronizability region scales approximately as $k^{-\mu}$, where $k$ is the outgoing connectivity and $\mu$ depends on the local nonlinearity. For deterministic scale-free networks coherence is observed only when the coupling is heterogeneous, namely when it is proportional to some power of the neighbor connectivity. In all cases, stability conditions are determined from the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplacian matrix and agree well with numerical results based on histograms of coherent states in parameter space. Additionally, we show that almost everywhere in the synchronizability region the basin of attraction of coherent states fills the entire phase space, and that the transition to coherence is of first-order.

010       Network Synchronization, Diffusion, and the Paradox of Heterogeneity
021       Many complex networks display strong heterogeneity in the degree (connectivity) distribution. 
020       Heterogeneity in the degree distribution often reduces the average distance between nodes but, paradoxically, may suppress synchronization in networks of oscillators coupled symmetrically with uniform coupling strength. Here we offer a solution to this apparent paradox. Our analysis is partially based on the identification of a diffusive process underlying the communication between oscillators and reveals a striking relation between this process and the condition for the linear stability of the synchronized states. We show that, for a given degree distribution, the maximum synchronizability is achieved when the network of couplings is weighted and directed, and the overall cost involved in the couplings is minimum. This enhanced synchronizability is solely determined by the mean degree and does not depend on the degree distribution and system size. Numerical verification of the main results is provided for representative classes of small-world and scale-free networks.

010       Random field Ising model and community structure in complex networks
021       We propose a method to find out the community structure of a complex network. 
020       In this method the ground state problem of a ferromagnetic random field Ising model is considered on the network with the magnetic field $B_s = +\infty$, $B_{t} = -\infty$, and $B_{i\neq s,t}=0$ for a node pair $s$ and $t$. The ground state problem is equivalent to the so-called maximum flow problem, which can be solved exactly numerically with the help of a combinatorial optimization algorithm. The community structure is then identified from the ground state Ising spin domains for all pairs of $s$ and $t$. Our method provides a criterion for the existence of the community structure, and is applicable to unweighted and weighted networks equally well. We demonstrate the performance of the method by applying it to the Barab\'asi-Albert network, Zachary karate club network, the scientific collaboration network, and the stock price correlation network.

010       Random graphs with arbitrary i.i.d. degrees
021       In this paper we derive results concerning the connected components and the diameter of random graphs with an arbitrary i.i.d. 
020       degree sequence. We study these properties primarily, but not exclusively, when the tail of the degree distribution is regularly varying with exponent $1-\tau$. There are three distinct cases: (i) $\tau&gt;3$, where the degrees have finite variance, (ii) $\tau\in (2,3)$, where the degrees have infinite variance, but finite mean, and (iii) $\tau\in (1,2)$, where the degrees have infinite mean. These random graphs can serve as models for complex networks where degree power laws are observed. <br />Our results are twofold. First, we give a criterion when there exists a unique largest connected component of size proportional to the size of the graph, and study sizes of the other connected components. Secondly, we establish a phase transition for the diameter when $\tau \in (2,3)$. Indeed, we show that for $\tau&gt;2$ and when nodes with degree 2 are present with positive probability, the diameter of the random graph is, with high probability, bounded below by a constant times the logarithm of the size of the graph. On the other hand, assuming that all degrees are at least 3 or more, we show that, for $\tau \in (2,3)$, the diameter of the graph is with high probability bounded from above by a constant times the $\log \log$ of the size of the graph.

010       Functional cartography of complex metabolic networks
021       High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. 
020       Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that one can (i) find functional modules in complex networks, and (ii) classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a ``cartographic representation'' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with more potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyze the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different super-kingdoms. We find that, typically, 80% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that low-degree metabolites that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.

010       Maximum flow and topological structure of complex networks
021       The problem of sending the maximum amount of flow $q$ between two arbitrary nodes $s$ and $t$ of complex networks along links with unit capacity is studied, which is equivalent to determining the number of link-disjoint paths between $s$ and $t$. 
020       The average of $q$ over all node pairs with smaller degree $k_{\rm min}$ is $&lt;q&gt;_{k_{\rm min}} \simeq c k_{\rm min}$ for large $k_{\rm min}$ with $c$ a constant implying that the statistics of $q$ is related to the degree distribution of the network. The disjoint paths between hub nodes are found to be distributed among the links belonging to the same edge-biconnected component, and $q$ can be estimated by the number of pairs of edge-biconnected links incident to the start and terminal node. The relative size of the giant edge-biconnected component of a network approximates to the coefficient $c$. The applicability of our results to real world networks is tested for the Internet at the autonomous system level.

010       Self-similarity of complex networks
021       Complex networks have been studied extensively due to their relevance to many real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the Internet, energy landscapes, biological and social networks \cite{ab-review,mendes,vespignani,newman,amaral}. 
020       A large number of real networks are called ``scale-free'' because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node \cite{ab-review,barabasi1999,faloutsos}. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not {\it length-scale} invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the ``small-world'' property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the ``diameter'' of the network \cite{erdos,bollobas,milgram,watts}, rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given "size". Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.

010       Local modularity measure for network clusterizations
021       Many complex networks have an underlying modular structure, i.e., structural subunits (communities or clusters) characterized by highly interconnected nodes. 
020       The modularity $Q$ has been introduced as a measure to assess the quality of clusterizations. $Q$ has a global view, while in many real-world networks clusters are linked mainly \emph{locally} among each other (\emph{local cluster-connectivity}). Here, we introduce a new measure, localized modularity $LQ$, which reflects local cluster structure. Optimization of $Q$ and $LQ$ on the clusterization of two biological networks shows that the localized modularity identifies more cohesive clusters, yielding a complementary view of higher granularity.

020       Many of the existing algorithms partition a network into clear clusters, without overlap. We here introduce a method to identify the nodes lying ``between clusters'' and that allows for a general measure of the stability of the clusters. This is done by adding noise over the weights of the edges of the network. Our method can in principle be applied with any clustering algorithm, provided that it works on weighted networks. We present several applications on real-world networks using the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL).

010       Emergent rewirings for cascades on correlated networks
021       Recent studies of attacks on complex networks suggest that small initial breakdowns can lead to global cascades of overload failures in communication, economic trading, and supply-transportation systems, considering the defense methods is very important to reduce the huge damage. 
020       The propagation of failures depends on the flow dynamics such as packet routing of physical quantities and on the heterogeneous distribution of load or capacity in many realistic networks which have topological properties of scale-free (SF) and degree-degree correlations. We introduce a defense strategy based on emergent rewirings between neighbors of the attacked node, and investigate the size of cascade on SF networks with controllable correlations. We show the differences of damaged size for the types of correlations and the effective range of tolerance in the defense methods. They can be performed on the current wireless communication or dynamic allocation technologies.

020       Our data exhibit several universal features in considered systems when they are analyzed from the point of view of evolving networks. Depending on the assumed definition of a network topology the degree distribution can follow a power law p(k) ~ k^(-\gamma) or can be described by an exponential function p(k) \~exp(-\alpha k). In the first case one observes that mean distances between two nodes are a linear function of logarithms of their degrees product.

010       A Model for Collaboration Networks Giving Rise to a Power Law   Distribution with an Exponential Cutoff
021       Recently several authors have proposed stochastic evolutionary models for the growth of complex networks that give rise to power-law distributions. 
020       These models are based on the notion of preferential attachment leading to the ``rich get richer'' phenomenon. Despite the generality of the proposed stochastic models, there are still some unexplained phenomena, which may arise due to the limited size of networks such as protein, e-mail, actor and collaboration networks. Such networks may in fact exhibit an exponential cutoff in the power-law scaling, although this cutoff may only be observable in the tail of the distribution for extremely large networks. We propose a modification of the basic stochastic evolutionary model, so that after a node is chosen preferentially, say according to the number of its inlinks, there is a small probability that this node will become inactive. We show that as a result of this modification, by viewing the stochastic process in terms of an urn transfer model, we obtain a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff. Unlike many other models, the current model can capture instances where the exponent of the distribution is less than or equal to two. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the consistency of our model empirically by analysing the Mathematical Research collaboration network, the distribution of which is known to follow a power law with an exponential cutoff.

010       Morphological complex networks: Can individual morphology determine the   general connectivity and dynamics of networks?
021       This article discusses how the individual morphological properties of basic objects (e.g. 
020       neurons, molecules and aggregates), jointly with their particular spatial distribution, can determine the connectivity and dynamics of systems composed by those objects. This problem is characterized as a particular case of the more general shape and function paradigm, which emphasizes the interplay between shape and function in nature and evolution. Five key issues are addressed: (a) how to measure shapes; (b) how to obtain stochastic models of classes of shapes; (c) how to simulate morphologically realistic systems of multiple objects; (d) how to characterize the connectivity and topology of such systems in terms of complex network concepts and measurements; and (e) how the dynamics of such systems can be ultimately affected, and even determined, by the individual morphological features of the basic objects. Although emphasis is placed on neuromorphic systems, the presented concepts and methods are useful also for several other multiple object systems, such as protein-protein interaction, tissues, aggregates and polymers.

010       Properties of weighted complex networks
021       We study two kinds of weighted networks, weighted small-world (WSW) and weighted scale-free (WSF). 
020       The weight $w_{ij}$ of a link between nodes $i$ and $j$ in the network is defined as the product of endpoint node degrees; that is $w_{ij}=(k_{i}k_{j})^{\theta}$. In contrast to adding weights to links during networks being constructed, we only consider weights depending on the `` popularity\rq\rq of the nodes represented by their connectivity. It was found that the both weighted networks have broad distributions on characterization the link weight, vertex strength, and average shortest path length. Furthermore, as a survey of the model, the epidemic spreading process in both weighted networks was studied based on the standard \emph{susceptible-infected} (SI) model. The spreading velocity reaches a peak very quickly after the infection outbreaks and an exponential decay was found in the long time propagation.

010       Load distribution in small world networks
021       In this paper we introduce a new model of data packet transport, based on a stochastic approach with the aim of characterizing the load distribution on complex networks. 
020       Moreover we analyze the load standard deviation as an index of uniformity of the distribution of packets within the network, to characterize the effects of the network topology. We measure such index on the model proposed by Watts and Strogatz as the redirection probability is increased. We find that the uniformity of the load spread is maximized in the intermediate region, at which the small world effect is observed and both global and local efficiency are high. Moreover we analyze the relationship between load centrality and degree centrality as an approximate measure of the load at the edges. Analogous results are obtained for the load variance computed at the edges as well as at the vertices.

010       Multi-state epidemic processes on complex networks
021       Infectious diseases are practically represented by models with multiple states and complex transition rules corresponding to, for example, birth, death, infection, recovery, disease progression, and quarantine. 
020       In addition, networks underlying infection events are often much more complex than described by meanfield equations or regular lattices. In models with simple transition rules such as the SIS and SIR models, heterogeneous contact rates are known to decrease epidemic thresholds. We analyze steady states of various multi-state disease propagation models with heterogeneous contact rates. In many models, heterogeneity simply decreases epidemic thresholds. However, in models with competing pathogens and mutation, coexistence of different pathogens for small infection rates requires network-independent conditions in addition to heterogeneity in contact rates. Furthermore, models without spontaneous neighbor-independent state transitions, such as cyclically competing species, do not show heterogeneity effects.

010       The Dynamics of Hierarchical Evolution of Complex Networks
021       Introduced recently, the concept of hierarchical degree allows a more complete characterization of the topological context of a node in a complex network than the traditional node degree. 
020       This article presents analytical characterization and studies of the density of hierarchical degrees in random and scale free networks. The obtained results allowed the identification of a hierarchy-dependent power law for the degrees of nodes in random complex networks, with Poisson density for the first hierarchical degree (obtained through master equation approach). Exact results were obtained for the second hierarchical degree in scale free networks.

010       Voter model dynamics in complex networks: Role of dimensionality,   disorder and degree distribution
021       We analyze the ordering dynamics of the voter model in different classes of complex networks. 
020       We observe that whether the voter dynamics orders the system depends on the effective dimensionality of the interaction networks. We also find that when there is no ordering in the system, the average survival time of metastable states in finite networks decreases with network disorder and degree heterogeneity. The existence of hubs in the network modifies the linear system size scaling law of the survival time. The size of an ordered domain is sensitive to the network disorder and the average connectivity, decreasing with both; however it seems not to depend on network size and degree heterogeneity.

010       Kinetic growth walks on complex networks
021       Kinetically grown self-avoiding walks on various types of generalized random networks have been studied. 
020       Networks with short- and long-tailed degree distributions $P(k)$ were considered ($k$, degree or connectivity), including scale-free networks with $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$. The long-range behaviour of self-avoiding walks on random networks is found to be determined by finite-size effects. The mean self-intersection length of non-reversal random walks, $&lt;l&gt;$, scales as a power of the system size $N$: $&lt;l &gt; \sim N^{\beta}$, with an exponent $\beta = 0.5$ for short-tailed degree distributions and $\beta &lt; 0.5$ for scale-free networks with $\gamma &lt; 3$. The mean attrition length of kinetic growth walks, $&lt;L&gt;$, scales as $&lt;L &gt; \sim N^{\alpha}$, with an exponent $\alpha$ which depends on the lowest degree in the network. Results of approximate probabilistic calculations are supported by those derived from simulations of various kinds of networks. The efficiency of kinetic growth walks to explore networks is largely reduced by inhomogeneity in the degree distribution, as happens for scale-free networks.

010       Static Pairwise Annihilation in Complex Networks
021       We study static annihilation on complex networks, in which pairs of connected particles annihilate at a constant rate during time. 
020       Through a mean-field formalism, we compute the temporal evolution of the distribution of surviving sites with an arbitrary number of connections. This general formalism, which is exact for disordered networks, is applied to Kronecker, Erd\"os-R\'enyi (i.e. Poisson) and scale-free networks. We compare our theoretical results with extensive numerical simulations obtaining excellent agreement. Although the mean-field approach applies in an exact way neither to ordered lattices nor to small-world networks, it qualitatively describes the annihilation dynamics in such structures. Our results indicate that the higher the connectivity of a given network element, the faster it annihilates. This fact has dramatic consequences in scale-free networks, for which, once the ``hubs'' have been annihilated, the network disintegrates and only isolated sites are left.

010       Spectral Measures of Bipartivity in Complex Networks
021       We introduce a quantitative measure of network bipartivity as a proportion of even to total number of closed walks in the network. 
020       Spectral graph theory is used to quantify how close to bipartite a network is and the extent to which individual nodes and edges contribute to the global network bipartivity. It is shown that the bipartivity characterizes the network structure and can be related to the efficiency of semantic or communication networks, trophic interactions in food webs, construction principles in metabolic networks, or communities in social networks.

010       Subgraph Centrality in Complex Networks
021       We introduce a new centrality measure that characterizes the participation of each node in all subgraphs in a network. 
020       Smaller subgraphs are given more weight than larger ones, which makes this measure appropriate for characterizing network motifs. We show that the subgraph centrality (SC) can be obtained mathematically from the spectra of the adjacency matrix of the network. This measure is better able to discriminate the nodes of a network than alternate measures such as degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities. We study eight real-world networks for which SC displays useful and desirable properties, such as clear ranking of nodes and scale-free characteristics. Compared with the number of links per node, the ranking introduced by SC (for the nodes in the protein interaction network of S. cereviciae) is more highly correlated with the lethality of individual proteins removed from the proteome.

010       Knowledge Representation Issues in Semantic Graphs for Relationship   Detection
021       An important task for Homeland Security is the prediction of threat vulnerabilities, such as through the detection of relationships between seemingly disjoint entities. 
020       A structure used for this task is a "semantic graph", also known as a "relational data graph" or an "attributed relational graph". These graphs encode relationships as "typed" links between a pair of "typed" nodes. Indeed, semantic graphs are very similar to semantic networks used in AI. The node and link types are related through an ontology graph (also known as a schema). Furthermore, each node has a set of attributes associated with it (e.g., "age" may be an attribute of a node of type "person"). Unfortunately, the selection of types and attributes for both nodes and links depends on human expertise and is somewhat subjective and even arbitrary. This subjectiveness introduces biases into any algorithm that operates on semantic graphs. Here, we raise some knowledge representation issues for semantic graphs and provide some possible solutions using recently developed ideas in the field of complex networks. In particular, we use the concept of transitivity to evaluate the relevance of individual links in the semantic graph for detecting relationships. We also propose new statistical measures for semantic graphs and illustrate these semantic measures on graphs constructed from movies and terrorism data.

010       The effects of spatial constraints on the evolution of weighted complex   networks
021       Motivated by the empirical analysis of the air transportation system, we define a network model that includes geographical attributes along with topological and weight (traffic) properties. 
020       The introduction of geographical attributes is made by constraining the network in real space. Interestingly, the inclusion of geometrical features induces non-trivial correlations between the weights, the connectivity pattern and the actual spatial distances of vertices. The model also recovers the emergence of anomalous fluctuations in the betweenness-degree correlation function as first observed by Guimer\`a and Amaral [Eur. Phys. J. B {\bf 38}, 381 (2004)]. The presented results suggest that the interplay between weight dynamics and spatial constraints is a key ingredient in order to understand the formation of real-world weighted networks.

010       Strong correlations between text quality and complex networks features
021       Concepts of complex networks have been used to obtain metrics that were correlated to text quality established by scores assigned by human judges. 
020       Texts produced by high-school students in Portuguese were represented as scale-free networks (word adjacency model), from which typical network features such as the in/outdegree, clustering coefficient and shortest path were obtained. Another metric was derived from the dynamics of the network growth, based on the variation of the number of connected components. The scores assigned by the human judges according to three text quality criteria (coherence and cohesion, adherence to standard writing conventions and theme adequacy/development) were correlated with the network measurements. Text quality for all three criteria was found to decrease with increasing average values of outdegrees, clustering coefficient and deviation from the dynamics of network growth. Among the criteria employed, cohesion and coherence showed the strongest correlation, which probably indicates that the network measurements are able to capture how the text is developed in terms of the concepts represented by the nodes in the networks. Though based on a particular set of texts and specific language, the results presented here point to potential applications in other instances of text analysis.

010       Change of ownership networks in Japan
021       As complex networks in economics, we consider Japanese shareholding networks as they existed in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2002, and 2003. 
020       In this study, we use as data lists of shareholders for companies listed on the stock market or on the over-the-counter market. The lengths of the shareholder lists vary with the companies, and we use lists for the top 20 shareholders. We represent these shareholding networks as a directed graph by drawing arrows from shareholders to stock corporations. Consequently, the distribution of incoming edges has an upper bound, while that of outgoing edges has no bound. This representation shows that for all years the distributions of outgoing degrees can be well explained by the power law function with an exponential tail. The exponent depends on the year and the country, while the power law shape is maintained universally. We show that the exponent strongly correlates with the long-term shareholding rate and the cross-shareholding rate.

We calculate analytical and numerically critical points for a threshold model in several classes of complex networks, including an empirical social network.

We present in this work an example of complex technological network, investigating the process flow of an ammonia plant (AP). We show that the AP network is a small-world network with scale-free distribution of degrees. Adopting Newman's maximum modularity algorithm for the detection of communities in complex networks, evident modular structures are identified in the AP network, which stem from the modular sections in chemical plants. In addition, we find that the resultant AP tree exhibits excellent allometric scaling.

010       Spectral Scaling in Complex Networks
021       A complex network is said to show topological isotropy if the topological structure around a particular node looks the same in all directions of the whole network. 
020       Topologically anisotropic networks are those where the local neighborhood around a node is not reproduced at large scale for the whole network. The existence of topological isotropy is investigated by the existence of a power-law scaling between a local and a global topological characteristic of complex networks obtained from graph spectra. We investigate this structural characteristic of complex networks and its consequences for 32 real-world networks representing informational, technological, biological, social and ecological systems.

020       The classical dynamics on an Erdos-Renyi network with the wiring probability $p_{ER} \le \frac{1}{N}$ is in the state of collective order, while that on an Erdos-Renyi network with $p_{ER} &gt; \frac{1}{N}$ in the state of collective chaos. The dynamics on a WS Small-world complex network evolves from collective order to collective chaos rapidly in the region of the rewiring probability $p_r \in [0.0,0.1]$, and then keeps chaotic up to $p_r = 1.0$. The dynamics on a Growing Random Network (GRN) is in a special state deviates from order significantly in a way opposite to that on WS small-world networks. Each network can be measured by a couple values of two parameters $(\beta ,\eta)$.

010       Characterization of complex networks: A survey of measurements
021       Each complex network (or class of networks) presents specific topological features which characterize its connectivity and highly influence the dynamics of processes executed on the network. 
020       The analysis, discrimination, and synthesis of complex networks therefore rely on the use of measurements capable of expressing the most relevant topological features. This article presents a survey of such measurements. It includes general considerations about complex network characterization, a brief review of the principal models, and the presentation of the main existing measurements. Important related issues covered in this work comprise the representation of the evolution of complex networks in terms of trajectories in several measurement spaces, the analysis of the correlations between some of the most traditional measurements, perturbation analysis, as well as the use of multivariate statistics for feature selection and network classification. Depending on the network and the analysis task one has in mind, a specific set of features may be chosen. It is hoped that the present survey will help the proper application and interpretation of measurements.

020       We show that if the number of connections is sufficiently high, these networks contain a core of highly interconnected vertices. The number of vertices in this core varies in the range between $const N^{1/2}$ and $const N^{2/3}$, where $N$ is the number of vertices in a network. At the birth point of the core, we obtain the size-dependent cut-off of the distribution of the number of connections and find that its position differs from earlier estimates.

We also discuss the topological changes of RG and SF networks between the initial and stationary states.

010       Efficient routing on complex networks
021       In this letter, we propose a new routing strategy to improve the transportation efficiency on complex networks. 
020       Instead of using the routing strategy for shortest path, we give a generalized routing algorithm to find the so-called {\it efficient path}, which considers the possible congestion in the nodes along actual paths. Since the nodes with largest degree are very susceptible to traffic congestion, an effective way to improve traffic and control congestion, as our new strategy, can be as redistributing traffic load in central nodes to other non-central nodes. Simulation results indicate that the network capability in processing traffic is improved more than 10 times by optimizing the efficient path, which is in good agreement with the analysis.

020       Though the microscopic dynamics are different, these models are found to bear a similar mathematical framework, and hence exhibit some common behaviors, for example, the power-law distributions and evolution of degree, weight and strength. We also study the nontrivial clustering coefficient C and tunable degree assortativity coefficient r, depending on specific parameters. Most results are supported by present empirical evidences, and may provide us with a better description of the hierarchies and organizational architecture of weighted networks. Our models have been inspired by the weighted network model proposed by Alain Barrat et al. (BBV for short), and can be considered as a meaningful development of their original work.

010       Socioeconomic development and stability: A complex network blueprint
021       The current work discusses how complex networks can be applied in order to aid economical development and stability at several scales and contexts. 
020       The following activities are involved: (a) compilation of several types of data related to socioeconomic development; (b) representation of such data in terms of multilayer interacting complex networks (<a href="/abs/cond-mat/0406369">cond-mat/0406369</a>) registered geographically; (c) application of traditional and new methods for complex networks characterization and analysis. Such an approach allows the identification of bottlenecks and deficits/surpluses, simulation of system development under varying constraints and perturbations, as well as the application of optimization methods in order to help identify the most effective strategies leading to social and economic wealth and stability. In addition to its practical implications, such an approach also emphasizes several issues of substantial theoretical interest, including the integration of networks of different natures, the interplay between the dynamics of topological and node state evolution, the effects of geographical constraints, community finding, as well as optimization issues. The discussed methodology is particularly interesting for applications in developing countries because of the greater potential for economic evolution in such nations. This manuscript also includes a brief review of complex networks approaches to socioeconomics modeling.

010       Fifteen Minutes of Fame: The Dynamics of Information Access on the Web
021       While current studies on complex networks focus on systems that change relatively slowly in time, the structure of the most visited regions of the Web is altered at the timescale from hours to days. 
020       Here we investigate the dynamics of visitation of a major news portal, representing the prototype for such a rapidly evolving network. The nodes of the network can be classified into stable nodes, that form the time independent skeleton of the portal, and news documents. The visitation of the two node classes are markedly different, the skeleton acquiring visits at a constant rate, while a news document's visitation peaking after a few hours. We find that the visitation pattern of a news document decays as a power law, in contrast with the exponential prediction provided by simple models of site visitation. This is rooted in the inhomogeneous nature of the browsing pattern characterizing individual users: the time interval between consecutive visits by the same user to the site follows a power law distribution, in contrast with the exponential expected for Poisson processes. We show that the exponent characterizing the individual user's browsing patterns determines the power-law decay in a document's visitation. Finally, our results document the fleeting quality of news and events: while fifteen minutes of fame is still an exaggeration in the online media, we find that access to most news items significantly decays after 36 hours of posting.

010       Complex Networks as Hypergraphs
021       The representation of complex systems as networks is inappropriate for the study of certain problems. 
020       We show several examples of social, biological, ecological and technological systems where the use of complex networks gives very limited information about the structure of the system. We propose to use hypergraphs to represent these systems by introducing the concept of the complex hyper-network. We define several structural measures for complex hyper-networks. These measures characterize hyper-network structures on the basis of node participation in different hyper-edges (groups) and sub-hypergraphs. We also define two clustering coefficients, one characterizing the transitivity in the hyper-network through the proportion of hyper-triangles to paths of length two and the other characterizing the formation of triples of mutually adjacent groups in the hyper-network. All of these characteristics are studied in two different hyper-networks; a scientific collaboration hyper-network and an ecological competence hyper-network.

010       Surviving opinions in Sznajd models on complex networks
021       The Sznajd model has been largely applied to simulate many sociophysical phenomena. 
020       In this paper we applied the Sznajd model with more than two opinions on three different network topologies and observed the evolution of surviving opinions after many interactions among the nodes. As result, we obtained a scaling law which depends of the network size and the number of possible opinions. We also observed that this scaling law is not the same for all network topologies, being quite similar between scale-free networks and Sznajd networks but different for random networks.

010       Diversity as a product of interspecial interactions
021       We demonstrate diversification rather than optimisation for highly interacting organisms in a well mixed biological system by means of a simple model and reference to experiment, and find the cause to be the complex network of interactions formed, allowing species less well adapted to an environment to flourish by co-interaction over the `best' species. 
020       This diversification can be considered as the construction of many co-evolutionary niches by the network of interactions between species. Evidence for this comes from work with the bacteria Escherichia coli, which may coexist with their own mutants under certain conditions. Diversification only occurs above a certain threshold interaction strength, below which competitive exclusion occurs.

010       The Discovery of Spiral Arms in the Starburst Galaxy M82
021       We report the discovery of two symmetric spiral arms in the near-infrared (NIR) images of the starburst galaxy M82. 
020       The spiral arms are recovered when an axi-symmetric exponential disk is subtracted from the NIR images. The arms emerge from the ends of the NIR bar and can be traced up to three disk scalelengths. The winding of the arms is consistent with an m=2 logarithmic spiral mode of pitch angle 14 degrees. The arms are bluer than the disk in spite of their detection on the NIR images. If the northern side of the galaxy is nearer to us, as is normally assumed, the observed sense of rotation implies trailing arms. The nearly edge-on orientation, high disk surface brightness, and the presence of a complex network of dusty filaments in the optical images, are responsible for the lack of detection of the arms in previous studies.

010       Correlations in interacting systems with a network topology
021       We study pair correlations in cooperative systems placed on complex networks. 
020       We show that usually in these systems, the correlations between two interacting objects (e.g., spins), separated by a distance $\ell$, decay, on average, faster than $1/(\ell z_\ell)$. Here $z_\ell$ is the mean number of the $\ell$-th nearest neighbors of a vertex in a network. This behavior, in particular, leads to a dramatic weakening of correlations between second and more distant neighbors on networks with fat-tailed degree distributions, which have a divergent number $z_2$ in the infinite network limit. In this case, only the pair correlations between the nearest neighbors are observable. We obtain the pair correlation function of the Ising model on a complex network and also derive our results in the framework of a phenomenological approach.

020       The emergence of these properties from such man-made networks is explained as a consequence of the currently used principles for process design, which include heuristics as well as algorithmic techniques. We expect these results to be valid for chemical plants of different types and capacities.

010       Nonextensive aspects of small-world networks
021       Nonextensive aspects of the degree distribution in Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world networks, $P_{SW}(k)$, have been discussed in terms of a generalized Gaussian (referred to as {\it $Q$-Gaussian}) which is derived by the three approaches: the maximum-entropy method (MEM), stochastic differential equation (SDE), and hidden-variable distribution (HVD). 
020       In MEM, the degree distribution $P_Q(k)$ in complex networks has been obtained from $Q$-Gaussian by maximizing the nonextensive information entropy with constraints on averages of $k$ and $k^2$ in addition to the normalization condition. In SDE, $Q$-Gaussian is derived from Langevin equations subject to additive and multiplicative noises. In HVD, $Q$-Gaussian is made by a superposition of Gaussians for random networks with fluctuating variances, in analogy to superstatistics. Interestingly, {\it a single} $P_{Q}(k)$ may describe, with an accuracy of $\mid P_{SW}(k)-P_Q(k)\mid \siml 10^{-2} $, main parts of degree distributions of SW networks, within which about 96-99 percents of all $k$ states are included. It has been demonstrated that the overall behavior of $P_{SW}(k)$ including its tails may be well accounted for if the $k$-dependence is incorporated into the entropic index in MEM, which is realized in microscopic Langevin equations with generalized multiplicative noises.

010       Core-periphery organization of complex networks
021       Networks may, or may not, be wired to have a core that is both itself densely connected and central in terms of graph distance. 
020       In this study we propose a coefficient to measure if the network has such a clear-cut core-periphery dichotomy. We measure this coefficient for a number of real-world and model networks and find that different classes of networks have their characteristic values. For example do geographical networks have a strong core-periphery structure, while the core-periphery structure of social networks (despite their positive degree-degree correlations) is rather weak. We proceed to study radial statistics of the core, i.e. properties of the n-neighborhoods of the core vertices for increasing n. We find that almost all networks have unexpectedly many edges within n-neighborhoods at a certain distance from the core suggesting an effective radius for non-trivial network processes.

010       Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in   nature and society
021       Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. 
020       A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.

010       Hierarchy, Fractality, Small-World and Resilience of Haversian Bone   Structure: A Complex Network Study
021       This article describes the application of recently introduced complex networks concepts and methods to the characterization and analysis of cortical bone structure. 
020       Three-dimensional reconstructions of the system of channels underlying bone structure are obtained by using histological and computer graphics methods and then represented in terms of complex networks. Con&amp;#64258;uences of two or more channels are represented as nodes, while the interconnecting channels are expressed as edges. The hierarchical backbone (the tree with maximum depth) of such a network is obtained and understood to correspond to the main structure underlying the channel system. The remainder of the network is shown to correspond to geographical communities, suggesting that the bone channel structure involves a number of regular communities appended along the hierarchical backbone. It is shown that such additional edges play a crucial role in enhancing the network resilience and in reducing the shortest paths in both topology and geometry.The recently introduced concept of fractal dimension of a network (<a href="/abs/cond-mat/0503078">cond-mat/0503078</a>) is then correlated with the resilience of the several components of the bone channel structure to obstruction and failure, with important implications for the understanding of the organization and robustness of cortical bone structure.

010       Origins of fractality in the growth of complex networks
021       Complex networks from such different fields as biology, technology or sociology share similar organization principles. 
020       The possibility of a unique growth mechanism promises to uncover universal origins of collective behaviour. In particular, the emergence of self-similarity in complex networks raises the fundamental question of the growth process according to which these structures evolve. Here we investigate the concept of renormalization as a mechanism for the growth of fractal and non-fractal modular networks. We show that the key principle that gives rise to the fractal architecture of networks is a strong effective 'repulsion' (or, disassortativity) between the most connected nodes (that is, the hubs) on all length scales, rendering them very dispersed. More importantly, we show that a robust network comprising functional modules, such as a cellular network, necessitates a fractal topology, suggestive of an evolutionary drive for their existence.

010       Statistical-mechanical iterative algorithms on complex networks
021       The Ising models have been applied for various problems on information sciences, social sciences, and so on. 
020       In many cases, solving these problems corresponds to minimizing the Bethe free energy. To minimize the Bethe free energy, a statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm is often used. We study the statistical-mechanical iterative algorithm on complex networks. To investigate effects of heterogeneous structures on the iterative algorithm, we introduce an iterative algorithm based on information of heterogeneity of complex networks, in which higher-degree nodes are likely to be updated more frequently than lower-degree ones. Numerical experiments clarified that the usage of the information of heterogeneity affects the algorithm in BA networks, but does not influence that in ER networks. It is revealed that information of the whole system propagates rapidly through such high-degree nodes in the case of Barab{\'a}si-Albert's scale-free networks.

021       We study the synchronization of R{\"o}ssler oscillators as prototype of chaotic systems, when they are coupled on scale-free complex networks. 
020       We find that the underlying topology crucially affects the global synchronization properties. Especially, we show that the existence of loops facilitates the synchronizability of the system, whereas R\"ossler oscillators do not synchronize on tree-like topologies beyond a certain size. By considering Cayley trees, modified by various shortcuts, we find that also the distribution of shortest path lengths between two oscillators plays an important role for the global synchronization.

020       In this work we investigate, using the Hopfield model, the influence of the network architecture on the performance for associative recall while the network is under hub and edge attack. We show, by using four different attack strategies, that although the importance of hubs is more definite for Barab\'asi-Albert neuronal networks, the random removal of the same amount of edges as in a hub may imply a greater reduction of memory recall.

010       Assortative mixing by degree makes a network more unstable
021       We investigate the role of degree correlation among nodes on the stability of complex networks, by studying spectral properties of randomly weighted matrices constructed from directed Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi and scale-free random graph models. 
020       We focus on the behaviour of the largest real part of the eigenvalues, $\lambda_\text{max}$, that governs the growth rate of perturbations about an equilibrium (and hence, determines stability). We find that assortative mixing by degree, where nodes with many links connect preferentially to other nodes with many links, reduces the stability of networks. In particular, for sparse scale-free networks with $N$ nodes, $\lambda_\text{max}$ scales as $N^\alpha$ for highly assortative networks, while for disassortative graphs, $\lambda_\text{max}$ scales logarithmically with $N$. This difference may be a possible reason for the prevalence of disassortative networks in nature.

010       The Complex Network of Evolutionary Computation Authors: an Initial   Study
021       EC paper authors form a complex network of co-authorship which is, by itself, a example of an evolving system with its own rules, concept of fitness, and patterns of attachment. 
020       In this paper we explore the network of authors of evolutionary computation papers found in a major bibliographic database. We examine its macroscopic properties, and compare it with other co-authorship networks; the EC co-authorship network yields results in the same ballpark as other networks, but exhibits some distinctive patterns in terms of internal cohesion. We also try to find some hints on what makes an author a sociometric star. Finally, the role of proceeding editorship as the origin of long-range links in the co-authorship network is studied as well.

010       Scaling of optimal-path-lengths distribution in complex networks
021       We study the distribution of optimal path lengths in random graphs with random weights associated with each link (``disorder''). 
020       With each link $i$ we associate a weight $\tau_i = \exp(ar_i)$ where $r_i$ is a random number taken from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and the parameter $a$ controls the strength of the disorder. We suggest, in analogy with the average length of the optimal path, that the distribution of optimal path lengths has a universal form which is controlled by the expression $\frac{1}{p_c}\frac{\ell_{\infty}}{a}$, where $\ell_{\infty}$ is the optimal path length in strong disorder ($a \to \infty$) and $p_c$ is the percolation threshold. This relation is supported by numerical simulations for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and scale-free graphs. We explain this phenomenon by showing explicitly the transition between strong disorder and weak disorder at different length scales in a single network.

010       Width of percolation transition in complex networks
021       It is known that the critical probability for the percolation transition is not a sharp threshold, actually it is a region of non-zero width $\Delta p_c$ for systems of finite size. 
020       Here we present evidence that for complex networks $\Delta p_c \sim \frac{p_c}{l}$, where $l \sim N^{\nu_{opt}}$ is the average length of the percolation cluster, and $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. For Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graphs $\nu_{opt} = 1/3$, while for scale-free (SF) networks with a degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$ and $3&lt;\lambda&lt;4$, $\nu_{opt} = (\lambda-3)/(\lambda-1)$. We show analytically and numerically that the \textit{survivability} $S(p,l)$, which is the probability of a cluster to survive $l$ chemical shells at probability $p$, behaves near criticality as $S(p,l) = S(p_c,l) \cdot exp[(p-p_c)l/p_c]$. Thus for probabilities inside the region $|p-p_c| &lt; p_c/l$ the behavior of the system is indistinguishable from that of the critical point.

010       Skeleton and fractal scaling in complex networks
021       We find that the fractal scaling in a class of scale-free networks originates from the underlying tree structure called skeleton, a special type of spanning tree based on the edge betweenness centrality. 
020       The fractal skeleton has the property of the critical branching tree. The original fractal networks are viewed as a fractal skeleton dressed with local shortcuts. An in-silico model with both the fractal scaling and the scale-invariance properties is also constructed. The framework of fractal networks is useful in understanding the utility and the redundancy in networked systems.

021       We study in this work the properties of the $Q_{mf}$ network which is constructed from an anisotropic partition of the square, the multifractal tiling. 
020       This tiling is build using a single parameter $\rho$, in the limit of $\rho \to 1$ the tiling degenerates into the square lattice that is associated with a regular network. <br />The $Q_{mf}$ network is a space-filling network with the following characteristics: it shows a power-law distribution of connectivity for $k&gt;7$ and it has an high clustering coefficient when compared with a random network associated. In addition the $Q_{mf}$ network satisfy the relation $N \propto \ell^{d_f}$ where $\ell$ is a typical length of the network (the average minimal distance) and $N$ the network size. We call $d_f$ the fractal dimension of the network. In tne limit case $\rho \to 1$ we have $d_{f} \to 2$.

020       The maximum degree k_max, representing the local property of the system, shows similar scaling behaviors for random graphs and scale-free networks. The fluctuations are quite random at short time scales but display strong anticorrelation at longer time scales under the same system size N and different repair probability p_re. The average degree &lt;k&gt;, revealing the statistical property of the system, exhibits completely different scaling behaviors for random graphs and scale-free networks. Random graphs display long-range power-law correlations. Scale-free networks are uncorrelated at short time scales; while anticorrelated at longer time scales and the anticorrelation becoming stronger with the increase of p_re.

010       Extremal dynamics on complex networks: Analytic solutions
021       The Bak-Sneppen model displaying punctuated equilibria in biological evolution is studied on random complex networks. 
020       By using the rate equation and the random walk approaches, we obtain the analytic solution of the fitness threshold $x_c$ to be 1/(&lt;k&gt;_f+1), where &lt;k&gt;_f=&lt;k^2&gt;/&lt;k&gt; (=&lt;k&gt;) in the quenched (annealed) updating case, where &lt;k^n&gt; is the n-th moment of the degree distribution. Thus, the threshold is zero (finite) for the degree exponent \gamma &lt;3 (\gamma &gt; 3) for the quenched case in the thermodynamic limit. The theoretical value x_c fits well to the numerical simulation data in the annealed case only. Avalanche size, defined as the duration of successive mutations below the threshold, exhibits a critical behavior as its distribution follows a power law, P_a(s) ~ s^{-3/2}.

021       Over the last decade, an enormous interest and activity in complex networks have been witnessed within the physics community. 
020       On the other hand, diffusion and its theory, have equipped the toolbox of the physicist for decades. In this paper, we will demonstrate how to combine these two seemingly different topics in a fruitful manner. In particular, we will review and develop further, an auxiliary diffusive process on weighted networks that represents a powerful concept and tool for studying network (community) structures. The working principle of the method is the observation that the relaxation of the diffusive process towards the stationary state is {\em non-local} and fastest in the highly connected regions of the network. This can be used to acquire non-trivial information about the structure of clustered and non-clustered networks.

010       Avalanche dynamics driven by adaptive rewirings in complex networks
021       We introduce a toy model displaying the avalanche dynamics of failure in scale-free networks. 
020       In the model, the network growth is based on the Barab\'asi and Albert model and each node is assigned a capacity or tolerance, which is constant irrespective of node index. The degree of each node increases over time. When the degree of a node exceeds its capacity, it fails and each link connected to it is is rewired to other unconnected nodes by following the preferential attachment rule. Such a rewiring edge may trigger another failure. This dynamic process can occur successively, and it exhibits a self-organized critical behavior in which the avalanche size distribution follows a power law. The associated exponent is $\tau \approx 2.6(1)$. The entire system breaks down when any rewired edges cannot locate target nodes: the time at which this occurs is referred to as the breaking time. We obtain the breaking time as a function of the capacity. Moreover, using extreme value statistics, we determine the distribution function of the breaking time.

010       Critical threshold and dynamics of a general rumor model on complex   networks
021       We derive mean-field equations that describe the dynamics of a general model of rumor spreading on complex networks, and use analytical and numerical solutions of these equations to examine the threshold behavior and dynamics of the model on random graphs, uncorrelated scale-free networks and scale-free networks with assortative degree correlations. 
020       We show that in both homogeneous networks and random graphs the model exhibits a critical threshold in the rumor spreading rate below which a rumor cannot propagate in the system. In the case of scale-free networks, on the other hand, this threshold becomes vanishingly small in the limit of infinite system size. We find that the initial rate at which a rumor spreads is much higher in scale-free networks than in random graphs, and that the rate at which the spreading proceeds on scale-free networks is further increased when assortative degree correlations are introduced. The impact of degree correlations on the final fraction of nodes that ever hears a rumor, however, depends on the interplay between network topology and the rumor spreading rate. Our results show that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading of rumors, just as they are to the spreading of infections. They are relevant to the spreading dynamics of chain emails, viral advertising and large-scale data dissemination algorithms on the Internet, the so-called gossip protocols.

020       In this paper, we address the hierarchy property sharing among a large amount of networks. Based upon the eigenvector centrality (EC) measure, a method is proposed to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of a complex network. It is tested on the Santa Fe Institute collaboration network, whose structure is well known. We also apply it to a Mathematicians' collaboration network and the protein interaction network of Yeast. The method can detect significantly hierarchical structures in these networks.

010       The network of concepts in written texts
021       Complex network theory is used to investigate the structure of meaningful concepts in written texts of individual authors. 
020       Networks have been constructed after a two phase filtering, where words with less meaning contents are eliminated, and all remaining words are set to their canonical form, without any number, gender or time flexion. Each sentence in the text is added to the network as a clique. A large number of written texts have been scrutinized, and its found that texts have small-world as well as scale-free structures. The growth process of these networks has also been investigated, and a universal evolution of network quantifiers have been found among the set of texts written by distinct authors. Further analyzes, based on shufling procedures taken either on the texts or on the constructed networks, provide hints on the role played by the word frequency and sentence length distributions to the network structure. Since the meaningful words are related to concepts in the author's mind, results for text networks may uncover patterns in communication and language processes that occur in the mind.

021       A concept of neighborhood in complex networks is addressed based on the criterion of the minimal number os steps to reach other vertices. 
020       This amounts to, starting from a given network $R_1$, generating a family of networks $R_\ell, \ell=2,3,...$ such that, the vertices that are $\ell$ steps apart in the original $R_1$, are only 1 step apart in $R_\ell$. The higher order networks are generated using Boolean operations among the adjacency matrices $M_\ell$ that represent $R_\ell$. The families originated by the well known linear and the Erd\"os-Renyi networks are found to be invariant, in the sense that the spectra of $M_\ell$ are the same, up to finite size effects. A further family originated from small world network is identified.

010       The Network of Inter-Regional Direct Investment Stocks across Europe
021       We propose a methodological framework to study the dynamics of inter-regional investment flow in Europe from a Complex Networks perspective, an approach with recent proven success in many fields including economics. 
020       In this work we study the network of investment stocks in Europe at two different levels: first, we compute the inward-outward investment stocks at the level of firms, based on ownership shares and number of employees; then we estimate the inward-outward investment stock at the level of regions in Europe, by aggregating the ownership network of firms, based on their headquarter location. Despite the intuitive value of this approach for EU policy making in economic development, to our knowledge there are no similar works in the literature yet. In this paper we focus on statistical distributions and scaling laws of activity, investment stock and connectivity degree both at the level of firms and at the level of regions. In particular we find that investment stock of firms is power law distributed with an exponent very close to the one found for firm activity. On the other hand investment stock and activity of regions turn out to be log-normal distributed. At both levels we find scaling laws relating investment to activity and connectivity. In particular, we find that investment stock scales with connectivity in a similar way as has been previously found for stock market data, calling for further investigations on a possible general scaling law holding true in economical networks.

010       Hierarchical Features of Large-Scale Cortical Connectivity
021       The analysis of complex networks has revealed patterns of organization in a variety of natural and artificial systems, including neuronal networks of the brain at multiple scales. 
020       In this paper, we describe a novel analysis of the large-scale connectivity between regions of the mammalian cerebral cortex, utilizing a set of hierarchical measurements proposed recently. We examine previously identified functional clusters of brain regions in macaque visual cortex and cat cortex and find significant differences between such clusters in terms of several hierarchical measures, revealing differences in how these clusters are embedded in the overall cortical architecture. For example, the ventral cluster of visual cortex maintains structurally more segregated, less divergent connections than the dorsal cluster, which may point to functionally different roles of their constituent brain regions.

020       It is a complex network has the properties of the right-skewed degree distribution and the clustering simultaneously, i.e., a hierarchical structure. An eigenvector centrality (EC) based method is used to reconstruct this hierarchical structure.

010       Approximations by graphs and emergence of global structures
021       We study approximations of billiard systems by lattice graphs. 
020       It is demonstrated that under natural assumptions the graph wavefunctions approximate solutions of the Schroedinger equation with energy rescaled by the billiard dimension. As an example, we analyze a Sinai billiard with attached leads. The results illustrate emergence of global structures in large quantum graphs and offer interesting comparisons with patterns observed in complex networks of a different nature.

010       Scaling Invariance in Spectra of Complex Networks: A Diffusion Factorial   Moment Approach
021       A new method called diffusion factorial moment (DFM) is used to obtain scaling features embedded in spectra of complex networks. 
020       For an Erdos-Renyi network with connecting probability $p_{ER} &lt; \frac{1}{N}$, the scaling parameter is $\delta = 0.51$, while for $p_{ER} \ge \frac{1}{N}$ the scaling parameter deviates from it significantly. For WS small-world networks, in the special region $p_r \in [0.05,0.2]$, typical scale invariance is found. For GRN networks, in the range of $\theta\in[0.33,049]$, we have $\delta=0.6\pm 0.1$. And the value of $\delta$ oscillates around $\delta=0.6$ abruptly. In the range of $\theta\in[0.54,1]$, we have basically $\delta&gt;0.7$. Scale invariance is one of the common features of the three kinds of networks, which can be employed as a global measurement of complex networks in a unified way.

010       Inhomogeneous percolation models for spreading phenomena in random graphs
021       Percolation theory has been largely used in the study of structural properties of complex networks such as the robustness, with remarkable results. 
020       Nevertheless, a purely topological description is not sufficient for a correct characterization of networks behaviour in relation with physical flows and spreading phenomena taking place on them. The functionality of real networks also depends on the ability of the nodes and the edges in bearing and handling loads of flows, energy, information and other physical quantities. We propose to study these properties introducing a process of inhomogeneous percolation, in which both the nodes and the edges spread out the flows with a given probability. <br />Generating functions approach is exploited in order to get a generalization of the Molloy-Reed Criterion for inhomogeneous joint site bond percolation in correlated random graphs. A series of simple assumptions allows the analysis of more realistic situations, for which a number of new results are presented. In particular, for the site percolation with inhomogeneous edge transmission, we obtain the explicit expressions of the percolation threshold for many interesting cases, that are analyzed by means of simple examples and numerical simulations. Some possible applications are debated.

010       Fluctuation-dissipation relations for complex networks
021       In the paper, we study fluctuations over several ensembles of maximum-entropy random networks. 
020       We derive several fluctuation-dissipation relations characterizing susceptibilities of different networks to changes in external fields. In the case of networks with a given degree sequence, we argue that the scale-free topologies of real-world networks may arise as a result of self-organization of real systems into sparse structures with low susceptibility to random external perturbations. We also show that the ensembles of networks with noninteracting links (both uncorrelated and with two-point correlations) are equivalent to random networks with hidden variables.

010       k-core organization of complex networks
021       We analytically describe the architecture of randomly damaged uncorrelated networks as a set of successively enclosed substructures -- k-cores. 
020       The k-core is the largest subgraph where vertices have at least k interconnections. We find the structure of k-cores, their sizes, and their birth points -- the bootstrap percolation thresholds. We show that in networks with a finite mean number z_2 of the second-nearest neighbors, the emergence of a k-core is a hybrid phase transition. In contrast, if z_2 diverges, the networks contain an infinite sequence of k-cores which are ultra-robust against random damage.

010       Localization transition on complex networks via spectral statistics
021       The spectral statistics of complex networks are numerically studied. 
020       <br />The features of the Anderson metal-insulator transition are found to be similar for a wide range of different networks. A metal-insulator transition as a function of the disorder can be observed for different classes of complex networks for which the average connectivity is small. The critical index of the transition corresponds to the mean field expectation. When the connectivity is higher, the amount of disorder needed to reach a certain degree of localization is proportional to the average connectivity, though a precise transition cannot be identified. The absence of a clear transition at high connectivity is probably due to the very compact structure of the highly connected networks, resulting in a small diameter even for a large number of sites.

The result indicates that the network, which is composed of the tags from the folksonomy, displays both properties of small world and scale-free. However, the statistics only shows a local and static slice of the vast body of folksonomy which is still evolving.

010       Complex Network Properties of Chinese Natural Science Basic Research
021       In this paper, we studied the research areas of Chinese natural science basic research from a point view of complex network. 
020       Two research areas are considered to be connected if they appear in one fund proposal. The explicit network of such connections using data from 1999 to 2004 is constructed. The analysis of the real data shows that the degree distribution of the {\bf research areas network} (RAN) may be better fitted by the exponential distribution. It displays small world effect in which randomly chosen pairs of research areas are typically separated by only a short path of intermediate research areas. The average distance of RAN decreases with time, while the average clustering coefficient increases with time, which indicates that the scientific study would like to be integrated together in terms of the studied areas. The relationship between the clustering coefficient $C(k)$ and the degree $k$ indicates that there is no hierarchical organization in RAN.

010       Epidemics in small world networks
021       For many infectious diseases, a small-world network on an underlying regular lattice is a suitable simplified model for the contact structure of the host population. 
020       It is well known that the contact network, described in this setting by a single parameter, the small-world parameter $p$, plays an important role both in the short term and in the long term dynamics of epidemic spread. We have studied the effect of the network structure on models of immune for life diseases and found that in addition to the reduction of the effective transmission rate, through the screening of infectives, spatial correlations may strongly enhance the stochastic fluctuations. As a consequence, time series of unforced Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) models provide patterns of recurrent epidemics with realistic amplitudes, suggesting that these models together with complex networks of contacts are the key ingredients to describe the prevaccination dynamical patterns of diseases such as measles and pertussis. We have also studied the role of the host contact strucuture in pathogen antigenic variation, through its effect on the final outcome of an invasion by a viral strain of a population where a very similar virus is endemic. Similar viral strains are modelled by the same infection and reinfection parameters, and by a given degree of cross immunity that represents the antigenic distance between the competing strains. We have found, somewhat surprisingly, that clustering on the network decreases the potential to sustain pathogen diversity.

010       Instability of defensive alliances in the predator-prey model on complex   networks
021       A model of six-species food web is studied in the viewpoint of spatial interaction structures. 
020       Each species has two predators and two preys, and it was previously known that the defensive alliances of three cyclically predating species self-organize in two-dimensions. The alliance-breaking transition occurs as either the mutation rate is increased or interaction topology is randomized in the scheme of the Watts-Strogatz model. In the former case of temporal disorder, via the finite-size scaling analysis the transition is clearly shown to belong to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. In contrast, the geometric or spatial randomness for the latter case yields a discontinuous phase transition. The mean-field limit of the model is analytically solved and then compared with numerical results. The dynamic universality and the temporally periodic behaviors are also discussed.

010       Relations between Average Distance, Heterogeneity and Network   Synchronizability
021       By using the random interchanging algorithm, we investigate the relations between average distance, standard deviation of degree distribution and synchronizability of complex networks. 
020       We find that both increasing the average distance and magnifying the degree deviation will make the network synchronize harder. Only the combination of short average distance and small standard deviation of degree distribution that ensures strong synchronizability. Some previous studies assert that the maximal betweenness is a right quantity to estimate network synchronizability: the larger the maximal betweenness, the poorer the network synchronizability. Here we address an interesting case, which strongly suggests that the single quantity, maximal betweenness, may not give a comprehensive description of network synchronizability.

021       The Penna bit-string model successfully encompasses many phenomena of population evolution, including inheritance, mutation, evolution and ageing. 
020       If we consider social interactions among individuals in the Penna model, the population will form a complex network. In this paper, we first modify the Verhulst factor to control only the birth rate, and introduce activity-based preferential reproduction of offspring in the Penna model. The social interactions among individuals are generated by both inheritance and activity-based preferential increase. Then we study the properties of the complex network generated by the modified Penna model. We find that the resulting complex network has a small-world effect and the assortative mixing property.

010       Scaling Invariance in Wave Functions of Quantum Systems on Complex   Networks
021       Structure-induced features of the wave functions for the quantum systems on complex networks are discussed in this paper. 
020       For a quantum system on a network, the state corresponding to the eigenvalue close to the center of the spectrum is used as the representative state to display the impacts of the structure on the wave functions. We consider the Erdos-Renyi, the WS small world and the growing randomly network (GRN) models. It is found that the probability distribution functions (PDF) of the representative state's components can be described with a power-law with an exponential cutoff in a unified way. For Erdos-Renyi networks, with the increase of the connectivity probability $p_{ER} $ the PDF turns from power-law-dominated to exponential-dominated functions. For the WS networks in a special region of the rewiring probability $p_r \in (0,0.2)$, where this model can capture the features of real world networks, and the GRN networks, the PDFs obey almost a perfect power-law. These characteristics can be used as the structure measurements of complex networks. They can also provide useful information on dynamical processes on complex networks.

010       Layered Complex Networks
021       Many complex networks are only a part of larger systems, where a number of coexisting topologies interact and depend on each other. 
020       We introduce a layered model to facilitate the description and analysis of such systems. As an example of its application we study the load distribution in three real-life transportation systems, where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure and the upper layer represents the traffic flows. This layered view allows us to capture the fundamental differences between the real load and commonly used load estimators, which explains why these estimators fail to approximate the real load.

010       An evolving network model with community structure
021       Many social and biological networks consist of communities - groups of nodes within which connections are dense, but between which connections are sparser. 
020       Recently, there has been considerable interest in designing algorithms for detecting community structures in real-world complex networks. In this paper, we propose an evolving network model which exhibits community structure. The network model is based on the inner-community preferential attachment and inter-community preferential attachment mechanisms. The degree distributions of this network model are analyzed based on a mean-field method. Theoretical results and numerical simulations indicate that this network model has community structure and scale-free properties.

010       Speed of synchronization in complex networks of neural oscillators   Analytic results based on Random Matrix Theory
021       We analyze the dynamics of networks of spiking neural oscillators. 
020       First, we present an exact linear stability theory of the synchronous state for networks of arbitrary connectivity. For general neuron rise functions, stability is determined by multiple operators, for which standard analysis is not suitable. We describe a general non-standard solution to the multi-operator problem. Subsequently, we derive a class of rise functions for which all stability operators become degenerate and standard eigenvalue analysis becomes a suitable tool. Interestingly, this class is found to consist of networks of leaky integrate and fire neurons. For random networks of inhibitory integrate-and-fire neurons, we then develop an analytical approach, based on the theory of random matrices, to precisely determine the eigenvalue distribution. This yields the asymptotic relaxation time for perturbations to the synchronous state which provides the characteristic time scale on which neurons can coordinate their activity in such networks. For networks with finite in-degree, i.e. finite number of presynaptic inputs per neuron, we find a speed limit to coordinating spiking activity: Even with arbitrarily strong interaction strengths neurons cannot synchronize faster than at a certain maximal speed determined by the typical in-degree.

010       Search in weighted complex networks
021       We study trade-offs presented by local search algorithms in complex networks which are heterogeneous in edge weights and node degree. 
020       We show that search based on a network measure, local betweenness centrality (LBC), utilizes the heterogeneity of both node degrees and edge weights to perform the best in scale-free weighted networks. The search based on LBC is universal and performs well in a large class of complex networks.

010       Synchronization reveals topological scales in complex networks
021       We study the relationship between topological scales and dynamic time scales in complex networks. 
020       The analysis is based on the full dynamics towards synchronization of a system of coupled oscillators. In the synchronization process, modular structures corresponding to well defined communities of nodes emerge in different time scales, ordered in a hierarchical way. The analysis also provides a useful connection between synchronization dynamics, complex networks topology and spectral graph analysis.

010       Complex networks in brain electrical activity
021       We analyze the complex networks associated with brain electrical activity. 
020       Multichannel EEG measurements are first processed to obtain 3D voxel activations using the tomographic algorithm LORETA. Then, the correlation of the current intensity activation between voxel pairs is computed to produce a voxel cross-correlation coefficient matrix. Using several correlation thresholds, the cross-correlation matrix is then transformed into a network connectivity matrix and analyzed. To study a specific example, we selected data from an earlier experiment focusing on the MMN brain wave. The resulting analysis highlights significant differences between the spatial activations associated with Standard and Deviant tones, with interesting physiological implications. When compared to random data networks, physiological networks are more connected, with longer links and shorter path lengths. Furthermore, as compared to the Deviant case, Standard data networks are more connected, with longer links and shorter path lengths--i.e., with a stronger ``small worlds'' character. The comparison between both networks shows that areas known to be activated in the MMN wave are connected. In particular, the analysis supports the idea that supra-temporal and inferior frontal data work together in the processing of the differences between sounds by highlighting an increased connectivity in the response to a novel sound.

010       Condensation phase transitions of symmetric conserved-mass aggregation   model on complex networks
021       We investigate condensation phase transitions of symmetric conserved-mass aggregation (SCA) model on random networks (RNs) and scale-free networks (SFNs) with degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}$. 
020       In SCA model, masses diffuse with unite rate, and unit mass chips off from mass with rate $\omega$. The dynamics conserves total mass density $\rho$. In the steady state, on RNs and SFNs with $\gamma&gt;3$ for $\omega \neq \infty$, we numerically show that SCA model undergoes the same type condensation transitions as those on regular lattices. However the critical line $\rho_c (\omega)$ depends on network structures. On SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$, the fluid phase of exponential mass distribution completely disappears and no phase transitions occurs. Instead, the condensation with exponentially decaying background mass distribution always takes place for any non-zero density. For the existence of the condensed phase for $\gamma \leq 3$ at the zero density limit, we investigate one lamb-lion problem on RNs and SFNs. We numerically show that a lamb survives indefinitely with finite survival probability on RNs and SFNs with $\gamma &gt;3$, and dies out exponentially on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$. The finite life time of a lamb on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$ ensures the existence of the condensation at the zero density limit on SFNs with $\gamma \leq 3$ at which direct numerical simulations are practically impossible. At $\omega = \infty$, we numerically confirm that complete condensation takes place for any $\rho &gt; 0$ on RNs. Together with the recent study on SFNs, the complete condensation always occurs on both RNs and SFNs in zero range process with constant hopping rate.

010       From simple to complex networks: inherent structures, barriers and   valleys in the context of spin glasses
021       Given discrete degrees of freedom (spins) on a graph interacting via an energy function, what can be said about the energy local minima and associated inherent structures? Using the lid algorithm in the context of a spin glass energy function, we investigate the properties of the energy landscape for a variety of graph topologies. 
020       First, we find that the multiplicity Ns of the inherent structures generically has a lognormal distribution. In addition, the large volume limit of ln&lt;Ns&gt;/&lt;lnNs&gt; differs from unity, except for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. Second, we find simple scaling laws for the growth of the height of the energy barrier between the two degenerate ground states and the size of the associated valleys. For finite connectivity models, changing the topology of the underlying graph does not modify qualitatively the energy landscape, but at the quantitative level the models can differ substantially.

010       Crossovers in ScaleFree Networks on Geographical Space
021       Complex networks are characterized by several topological properties: degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average shortest path length, etc. 
020       Using a simple model to generate scale-free networks embedded on geographical space, we analyze the relationship between topological properties of the network and attributes (fitness and location) of the vertices in the network. We find there are two crossovers for varying the scaling exponent of the fitness distribution.

010       Partial Synchronization on Complex Networks
021       Network topology plays an important role in governing the collective dynamics. 
020       Partial synchronization (PaS) on regular networks with a few non-local links is explored. Different PaS patterns out of the symmetry breaking are observed for different ways of non-local couplings. The criterion for the emergence of PaS is studied. The emergence of PaS is related to the loss of degeneration in Lyapunov exponent spectrum. Theoretical and numerical analysis indicate that non-local coupling may drastically change the dynamical feature of the network, emphasizing the important topological dependence of collective dynamics on complex networks.

010       A Review of Recent Studies of Geographical Scale-Free Networks
021       The scale-free (SF) structure that commonly appears in many complex networks is one of the hot topics related to social, biological, and information sciences. 
020       The self-organized generation mechanisms are expected to be useful for efficient communication or robust connectivity in socio-technological infrastructures. This paper is the first review of geographical SF network models. We discuss the essential generation mechanisms to induce the structure with power-law behavior and the properties of planarity and link length. The distributed designs of geographical SF networks without the crossing and long-range links that cause the interference and dissipation problems are very important for many applications such as in the Internet, power-grid, mobile, and sensor systems.

010       Computing communities in large networks using random walks (long   version)
021       Dense subgraphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. 
020       Computing them however is generally expensive. We propose here a measure of similarities between vertices based on random walks which has several important advantages: it captures well the community structure in a network, it can be computed efficiently, and it can be used in an agglomerative algorithm to compute efficiently the community structure of a network. We propose such an algorithm, called Walktrap, which runs in time O(mn^2) and space O(n^2) in the worst case, and in time O(n^2log n) and space O(n^2) in most real-world cases (n and m are respectively the number of vertices and edges in the input graph). Extensive comparison tests show that our algorithm surpasses previously proposed ones concerning the quality of the obtained community structures and that it stands among the best ones concerning the running time.

010       Hierarchical and mixing properties of static complex networks emerging   from the fluctuating classical random graphs
021       The Erdos-Renyi classical random graph is characterized by a fixed linking probability for all pairs of vertices. 
020       Here, this concept is generalized by drawing the linking probability from a certain distribution. Such a procedure is found to lead to a static complex network with an arbitrary connectivity distribution. In particular, a scale-free network with the hierarchical organization is constructed without assuming any knowledge about the global linking structure, in contrast to the preferential attachment rule for a growing network. The hierarchical and mixing properties of the static scale-free network thus constructed are studied. The present approach establishes a bridge between a scalar characterization of individual vertices and topology of an emerging complex network. The result may offer a clue for understanding the origin of a few abundance of connectivity distributions in a wide variety of static real-world networks.

010       Effects of Weight on Structure and Dynamics in Complex Networks
021       Link weight is crucial in weighted complex networks. 
020       It provides additional dimension for describing and adjusting the properties of networks. The topological role of weight is studied by the effects of random redistribution of link weights based on regular network with initial homogeneous weight. The small world effect emerges due to the weight randomization. Its effects on the dynamical systems coupled by weighted networks are also investigated. Randomization of weight can increase the transition temperature in Ising model and enhance the ability of synchronization of chaotic systems dramatically.

010       The emergence of coherence in complex networks of heterogeneous   dynamical systems
021       We present a general theory for the onset of coherence in collections of heterogeneous maps interacting via a complex connection network. 
020       Our method allows the dynamics of the individual uncoupled systems to be either chaotic or periodic, and applies generally to networks for which the number of connections per node is large. We find that the critical coupling strength at which a transition to synchrony takes place depends separately on the dynamics of the individual uncoupled systems and on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the coupling network. Our theory directly generalizes the Kuramoto model of equal strength, all-to-all coupled phase oscillators to the case of oscillators with more realistic dynamics coupled via a large heterogeneous network.

By assigning new (short) names to nodes (aka labelling) we are able to reduce significantly the memory requirement at the routers, yet we succeed in routing with high probability through paths very close in distance to the shortest ones.

010       Comparison and validation of community structures in complex networks
021       The issue of partitioning a network into communities has attracted a great deal of attention recently. 
020       Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one of finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since the problem formulated this way is NP-hard, most effort has gone into the construction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measures of community structures, similarities between various partitionings and the validation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a class of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which constitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US college football teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways of clustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures in networks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer ones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, and show by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare different partitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, which indicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularity corresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, we introduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external data when the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This is here possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, as well as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams are partitioned in reality. The partitioning of the gene network is validated by use of the Gene Ontology database, where we show that a community in general corresponds to a biological process.

010       Learning about knowledge: A complex network approach
021       This article describes an approach to modeling knowledge acquisition in terms of walks along complex networks. 
020       Each subset of knowledge is represented as a node, and relations between such knowledge are expressed as edges. Two types of edges are considered, corresponding to free and conditional transitions. The latter case implies that a node can only be reached after visiting previously a set of nodes (the required conditions). The process of knowledge acquisition can then be simulated by considering the number of nodes visited as a single agent moves along the network, starting from its lowest layer. It is shown that hierarchical networks, i.e. networks composed of successive interconnected layers, arise naturally as a consequence of compositions of the prerequisite relationships between the nodes. In order to avoid deadlocks, i.e. unreachable nodes, the subnetwork in each layer is assumed to be a connected component. Several configurations of such hierarchical knowledge networks are simulated and the performance of the moving agent quantified in terms of the percentage of visited nodes after each movement. The Barab\'asi-Albert and random models are considered for the layer and interconnecting subnetworks. Although all subnetworks in each realization have the same number of nodes, several interconnectivities, defined by the average node degree of the interconnection networks, have been considered. Two visiting strategies are investigated: random choice among the existing edges and preferential choice to so far untracked edges. A series of interesting results are obtained, including the identification of a series of plateaux of knowledge stagnation in the case of the preferential movements strategy in presence of conditional edges.

010       Effect of size heterogeneity on community identification in complex   networks
021       Identifying community structure can be a potent tool in the analysis and understanding of the structure of complex networks. 
020       Up to now, methods for evaluating the performance of identification algorithms use ad-hoc networks with communities of equal size. We show that inhomogeneities in community sizes can and do affect the performance of algorithms considerably, and propose an alternative method which takes these factors into account. Furthermore, we propose a simple modification of the algorithm proposed by Newman for community detection (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 69} 066133) which treats communities of different sizes on an equal footing, and show that it outperforms the original algorithm while retaining its speed.

010       The Network of Epicenters of the Olami-Feder-Christensen Model of   Earthquakes
021       We study the dynamics of the Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model of earthquakes, focusing on the behavior of sequences of epicenters regarded as a growing complex network. 
020       Besides making a detailed and quantitative study of the effects of the borders (the occurrence of epicenters is dominated by a strong border effect which does not scale with system size), we examine the degree distribution and the degree correlation of the graph. We detect sharp differences between the conservative and nonconservative regimes of the model. Removing border effects, the conservative regime exhibits a Poisson-like degree statistics and is uncorrelated, while the nonconservative has a broad power-law-like distribution of degrees (if the smallest events are ignored), which reproduces the observed behavior of real earthquakes. In this regime the graph has also a unusually strong degree correlation among the vertices with higher degree, which is the result of the existence of temporary attractors for the dynamics: as the system evolves, the epicenters concentrate increasingly on fewer sites, exhibiting strong synchronization, but eventually spread again over the lattice after a series of sufficiently large earthquakes. We propose an analytical description of the dynamics of this growing network, considering a Markov process network with hidden variables, which is able to account for the mentioned properties.

020       Application of mean-field theory yields as main prediction that for symmetric disordered initial conditions the mean time to reach full order is finite or diverges as a logarithm of the system size N, depending on the exponent of the degree distribution. Extensive numerical simulations contradict these results and clearly show that the mean-field assumption is not appropriate to describe this problem.

010       Synchronization in Network Structures: Entangled Topology as Optimal   Architecture for Network Design
021       In these notes we study synchronizability of dynamical processes defined on complex networks as well as its interplay with network topology. 
020       Building from a recent work by Barahona and Pecora [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 054101 (2002)], we use a simulated annealing algorithm to construct optimally-synchronizable networks. The resulting structures, known as entangled networks, are characterized by an extremely homogeneous and interwoven topology: degree, distance, and betweenness distributions are all very narrow, with short average distances, large loops, and small modularity. Entangled networks exhibit an excellent (almost optimal) performance with respect to other flow or connectivity properties such as robustness, random walk minimal first-passage times, and good searchability. All this converts entangled networks in a powerful concept with optimal properties in many respects.

010       Epidemic variability in complex networks
021       We study numerically the variability of the outbreak of diseases on complex networks. 
020       We use a SI model to simulate the disease spreading at short times, in homogeneous and in scale-free networks. In both cases, we study the effect of initial conditions on the epidemic's dynamics and its variability. The results display a time regime during which the prevalence exhibits a large sensitivity to noise. We also investigate the dependence of the infection time on nodes' degree and distance to the seed. In particular, we show that the infection time of hubs have large fluctuations which limit their reliability as early-detection stations. Finally, we discuss the effect of the multiplicity of shortest paths between two nodes on the infection time. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existence of even longer paths reduces the average infection time. These different results could be of use for the design of time-dependent containment strategies.

010       Majority-vote model on (3,4,6,4) and (3^4,6) Archimedean lattices
021       On Archimedean lattices, the Ising model exhibits spontaneous ordering. 
020       Two examples of these lattices of the majority-vote model with noise are considered and studied through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The order/disorder phase transition is observed in this system. The calculated values of the critical noise parameter are q_c=0.091(2) and q_c=0.134(3) for (3,4,6,4) and (3^4,6) Archimedean lattices, respectively. The critical exponents beta/nu, gamma/nu and 1/nu for this model are 0.103(6), 1.596(54), 0.872(85) for (3,4,6,4) and 0.114(3), 1.632(35), 0.978(104) for (3^4,6) Archimedean lattices. These results differs from the usual Ising model results and the majority-vote model on so-far studied regular lattices or complex networks. The effective dimensionality of the system [D_{eff}(3,4,6,4)=1.802(55) and D_{eff}(3^4,6)=1.860(34)] for these networks are reasonably close to the embedding dimension two.

010       k-core (bootstrap) percolation on complex networks: Critical phenomena   and nonlocal effects
021       We develop the theory of the k-core (bootstrap) percolation on uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. 
020       We show that the k-core percolation is an unusual, hybrid phase transition with a jump emergence of the k-core as at a first order phase transition but also with a critical singularity as at a continuous transition. We describe the properties of the k-core, explain the meaning of the order parameter for the k-core percolation, and reveal the origin of the specific critical phenomena. We demonstrate that a so-called ``corona'' of the k-core plays a crucial role (corona is a subset of vertices in the k-core which have exactly k neighbors in the k-core). It turns out that the k-core percolation threshold is at the same time the percolation threshold of finite corona clusters. The mean separation of vertices in corona clusters plays the role of the correlation length and diverges at the critical point. We show that a random removal of even one vertex from the k-core may result in the collapse of a vast region of the k-core around the removed vertex. The mean size of this region diverges at the critical point. We find an exact mapping of the k-core percolation to a model of cooperative relaxation. This model undergoes critical relaxation with a divergent rate at some critical moment.

010       Emergent Behavior in Agent Networks: Self-Organization in Wasp and Open   Source Communities
021       Understanding the complex dynamics of communities of software developers requires a view of such organizations as a network of interacting agents involving both goals and constraints. 
020       Beyond their special features, these systems display some overall patterns of organization not far from the ones seen in other types of organizations, including both natural and artificial entities. By looking at both software developers and social insects as agents interacting in a complex network, we found common statistical patterns of organization. Here, simple self-organizing processes leading to the formation of hierarchies in wasp colonies and open source communities are studied. Our analysis further validates simple models of formation of wasp hierarchies based on individual learning. In the open source community, a few members are clearly distinguished from the rest of the community with different reinforcement mechanisms.

010       Evolving Social Weighted Networks: Nonlocal Dynamics of Open Source   Communities
021       Complex networks emerge under different conditions through simple rules of growth and evolution. 
020       Such rules are typically local when dealing with biological systems and most social webs. An important deviation from such scenario is provided by communities of agents engaged in technology development, such as open source (OS) communities. Here we analyze their network structure, showing that it defines a complex weighted network with scaling laws at different levels, as measured by looking at e-mail exchanges. We also present a simple model of network growth involving non-local rules based on betweenness centrality. The model outcomes fit very well the observed scaling laws, suggesting that the overall goals of the community and the underlying hierarchical organization play a key role is shaping its dynamics.

020       We show that this Internet-based social network has a power-law region in degree distribution with exponent \gamma = 3.45. It is also a small-world network with high clustering of nodes. To study the community structure we simulate diffusion of a virtual substance immersed in such a network as in a multi-dimensional porous system. By analyzing concentration profiles at intermediate stage of the diffusion process the well-interconnected cliques of users can be identified as nodes with equal values of concentration.

We also report the experimental scaling of the fluctuations in the Internet for the Abilene backbone network. We found scaling exponents between 0.71 and 0.86 that do not fit with the exponent 1/2 reported in the literature.

010       Detecting rich-club ordering in complex networks
021       Uncovering the hidden regularities and organizational principles of networks arising in physical systems ranging from the molecular level to the scale of large communication infrastructures is the key issue for the understanding of their fabric and dynamical properties [1-5]. 
020       The ``rich-club'' phenomenon refers to the tendency of nodes with high centrality, the dominant elements of the system, to form tightly interconnected communities and it is one of the crucial properties accounting for the formation of dominant communities in both computer and social sciences [4-8]. Here we provide the analytical expression and the correct null models which allow for a quantitative discussion of the rich-club phenomenon. The presented analysis enables the measurement of the rich-club ordering and its relation with the function and dynamics of networks in examples drawn from the biological, social and technological domains.

010       Collective synchronization induced by epidemic dynamics on complex   networks with communities
021       Much recent empirical evidence shows that \textit{community structure} is ubiquitous in the real-world networks. 
020       In this Letter, we propose a growth model to create scale-free networks with the tunable strength (noted by $Q$) of community structure and investigate the influence of community strength upon the collective synchronization induced by SIRS epidemiological process. Global and local synchronizability of the system is studied by means of an order parameter and the relevant finite-size scaling analysis is provided. The numerical results show that, a phase transition occurs at $Q_c\simeq0.835$ from global synchronization to desynchronization and the local synchronization is weakened in a range of intermediately large $Q$. Moreover, we study the impact of mean degree $&lt;k&gt;$ upon synchronization on scale-free networks.

021       Wikipedia is a popular web-based encyclopedia edited freely and collaboratively by its users. 
020       In this paper we present an analysis of Wikipedias in several languages as complex networks. The hyperlinks pointing from one Wikipedia article to another are treated as directed links while the articles represent the nodes of the network. We show that many network characteristics are common to different language versions of Wikipedia, such as their degree distributions, growth, topology, reciprocity, clustering, assortativity, path lengths and triad significance profiles. These regularities, found in the ensemble of Wikipedias in different languages and of different sizes, point to the existence of a unique growth process. We also compare Wikipedias to other previously studied networks.

010       Structured thalamocortical connectivity revealed by random walks on   complex networks
021       The segregated regions of the mammalian cerebral cortex and thalamus form an extensive and complex network, whose structure and function are still only incompletely understood. 
020       The present article describes an application of the concepts of complex networks and random walks that allows the identification of non-random, highly structured features of thalamocortical connections, and their potential effects on dynamic interactions between cortical areas in the cat brain. Utilizing large-scale anatomical data sets of this thalamocortical system, we investigate uniform random walks in such a network by considering the steady state eigenvector of the respective stochastic matrix. It is shown that thalamocortical connections are organized in such a way as to guarantee strong correlation between the outdegree and occupancy rate (a stochastic measure potentially related to activation) of each cortical area. Possible organizational principles underlying this effect are identified and discussed.

010       Heterogeneity in connectivity of habitat networks saves stable   coexistence of competing species
021       Coexistence of individuals with different species or phenotypes is often found in nature in spite of competition between them. 
020       Stable coexistence of multiple types of individuals have implications for maintenance of ecological biodiversity and emergence of altruism in society, to name a few. Various mechanisms of coexistence including spatial structure of populations, heterogeneous individuals, and heterogeneous environments, have been proposed. In reality, individuals disperse and interact on complex networks. We examine how heterogeneous degree distributions of networks influence coexistence, focusing on models of cyclically competing species. We show analytically and numerically that heterogeneity in degree distributions promotes stable coexistence.

010       Competitive cluster growth in complex networks
021       Understanding the process by which the individuals of a society make up their minds and reach opinions about different issues can be of fundamental importance. 
020       In this work we propose an idealized model for competitive cluster growth in complex networks. Each cluster can be thought as a fraction of a community that shares some common opinion. Our results show that the cluster size distribution depends on the particular choice for the topology of the network of contacts among the agents. As an application, we show that the cluster size distributions obtained when the growth process is performed on hierarchical networks, e.g., the Apollonian network, have a scaling form similar to what has been observed for the distribution of number of votes in an electoral process. We suggest that this similarity is due to the fact that social networks involved in the electoral process may also posses an underlining hierarchical structure.

010       Diffusive Capture Process on Complex Networks
021       We study the dynamical properties of a diffusing lamb captured by a diffusing lion on the complex networks with various sizes of $N$. 
020       We find that the life time &lt;T&gt;$ of a lamb scales as &lt;T&gt;\sim N$ and the survival probability $S(N\to \infty,t)$ becomes finite on scale-free networks with degree exponent $\gamma&gt;3$. However, $S(N,t)$ for $\gamma&lt;3$ has a long-living tail on tree-structured scale-free networks and decays exponentially on looped scale-free networks. It suggests that the second moment of degree distribution &lt;k^2&gt;$ is the relevant factor for the dynamical properties in diffusive capture process. We numerically find that the normalized number of capture events at a node with degree $k$, $n(k)$, decreases as $n(k)\sim k^{-\sigma}$. When $\gamma&lt;3$, $n(k)$ still increases anomalously for $k\approx k_{max}$. We analytically show that $n(k)$ satisfies the relation $n(k)\sim k^2P(k)$ and the total number of capture events $N_{tot}$ is proportional to &lt;k^2&gt;$, which causes the $\gamma$ dependent behavior of $S(N,t)$ and &lt;T&gt;$.

010       Congestion-gradient driven transport on complex networks
021       We present a study of transport on complex networks with routing based on local information. 
020       Particles hop from one node of the network to another according to a set of routing rules with different degrees of congestion awareness, ranging from random diffusion to rigid congestion-gradient driven flow. Each node can be either source or destination for particles and all nodes have the same routing capacity, which are features of ad-hoc wireless networks. It is shown that the transport capacity increases when a small amount of congestion awareness is present in the routing rules, and that it then decreases as the routing rules become too rigid when the flow becomes strictly congestion-gradient driven. Therefore, an optimum value of the congestion awareness exists in the routing rules. It is also shown that, in the limit of a large number of nodes, networks using routing based on local information jam at any nonzero load. Finally, we study the correlation between congestion at node level and a betweenness centrality measure.

010       Protein domain connectivity and essentiality
021       Protein-protein interactions can be properly modeled as scale-free complex networks, while the lethality of proteins has been correlated with the node degrees, therefore defining a lethality-centrality rule. 
020       In this work we revisit this relevant problem by focusing attention not on proteins as a whole, but on their functional domains, which are ultimately responsible for their binding potential. Four networks are considered: the original protein-protein interaction network, its randomized version, and two domain networks assuming different lethality hypotheses. By using formal statistical analysis, we show that the correlation between connectivity and essentiality is higher for domains than for proteins.

010       Visual Saliency and Attention as Random Walks on Complex Networks
021       The current article shows how concepts from the areas of random walks, Markov chains, complex networks and image analysis can be naturally combined in order to provide a unified and biologically plausible model relating saliency and visual attention. 
020       Two types of models are proposed: (i) images are converted into complex networks by considering pixels as nodes while connections are established in terms of fields of influence defined by visual features such as tangent fields induced by gray-level contrasts and distance; and (ii) image pixels exhibiting particularly distinctive values of visual properties such as gray-level intensity, contrast, size of objects, orientation and texture are mapped into nodes and the weights of links are defined in order to favor transitions between regions with similar or different visual features, also taking the distance between the nodes into account. Preferential random walks are performed on such networks in order to emulate attentional shifts and eye movements, and the saliency of each region is obtained in terms of the frequency of visits to each node at equilibrium. In the case of the first model, there is a definite tendency to emphasize not only high curvature points but also convergences of the tangent field. The frequency of visits is found to be strongly correlated with the node degrees (strengths) for this model. Different results have been obtained for the second model as a consequence of the directed and asymmetric nature of the respectively obtained networks.

010       The Spread of Opinions and Proportional Voting
021       Election results are determined by numerous social factors that affect the formation of opinion of the voters, including the network of interactions between them and the dynamics of opinion influence. 
020       In this work we study the result of proportional elections using an opinion dynamics model similar to simple opinion spreading over a complex network. Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, regular lattices and randomly augmented lattices are considered as models of the underlying social networks. The model reproduces the power law behavior of number of candidates with a given number of votes found in real elections with the correct slope, a cutoff for larger number of votes and a plateau for small number of votes. It is found that the small world property of the underlying network is fundamental for the emergence of the power law regime.

010       Vulnerability of weighted networks
021       In real networks complex topological features are often associated with a diversity of interactions as measured by the weights of the links. 
020       Moreover, spatial constraints may as well play an important role, resulting in a complex interplay between topology, weight, and geography. In order to study the vulnerability of such networks to intentional attacks, these attributes must be therefore considered along with the topological quantities. In order to tackle this issue, we consider the case of the world-wide airport network, which is a weighted heterogeneous network whose evolution and structure are influenced by traffic and geographical constraints. We first characterize relevant topological and weighted centrality measures and then use these quantities as selection criteria for the removal of vertices. We consider different attack strategies and different measures of the damage achieved in the network. The analysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are capable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at very low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight and traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of complex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key features in the finding and development of defensive strategies.

010       Complex networks theory for analyzing metabolic networks
021       One of the main tasks of post-genomic informatics is to systematically investigate all molecules and their interactions within a living cell so as to understand how these molecules and the interactions between them relate to the function of the organism, while networks are appropriate abstract description of all kinds of interactions. 
020       In the past few years, great achievement has been made in developing theory of complex networks for revealing the organizing principles that govern the formation and evolution of various complex biological, technological and social networks. This paper reviews the accomplishments in constructing genome-based metabolic networks and describes how the theory of complex networks is applied to analyze metabolic networks.

010       Random Networks Tossing Biased Coins
021       In statistical mechanical investigations on complex networks, it is useful to employ random graphs ensembles as null models, to compare with experimental realizations. 
020       Motivated by transcription networks, we present here a simple way to generate an ensemble of random directed graphs with, asymptotically, scale-free outdegree and compact indegree. Entries in each row of the adjacency matrix are set to be zero or one according to the toss of a biased coin, with a chosen probability distribution for the biases. This defines a quick and simple algorithm, which yields good results already for graphs of size n ~ 100. Perhaps more importantly, many of the relevant observables are accessible analytically, improving upon previous estimates for similar graphs.

010       Universality in the synchronization of weighted random networks
021       Realistic networks display not only a complex topological structure, but also a heterogeneous distribution of weights in the connection strengths. 
020       Here we study synchronization in weighted complex networks and show that the synchronizability of random networks with large minimum degree is determined by two leading parameters: the mean degree and the heterogeneity of the distribution of node's intensity, where the intensity of a node, defined as the total strength of input connections, is a natural combination of topology and weights. Our results provide a possibility for the control of synchronization in complex networks by the manipulation of few parameters.

010       Community Detection in Complex Networks using Genetic Algorithm
021       Community structure identification has been an important research topic in complex networks and there has been many algorithms proposed so far to detect community structures in complex networks, where most of the algorithms are not suitable for very large networks because of their time-complexity. 
020       Genetic algorithm for detecting communities in complex networks, which is based on optimizing network modularity using genetic algorithm, is presented here. It is scalable to very large networks and does not need any priori knowledge about number of communities or any threshold value. It has O(e) time-complexity where e is the number of edges in the network. Its accuracy is tested with the known Zachary Karate Club and College Football datasets. Enron e-mail dataset is used for scalability test.

010       Effects of decision-making on the transport costs across complex   networks
021       We analyze the effects of agents' decisions on the creation of congestion on a centralized network with ring-and-hub topology. 
020       We show that there are two classes of agents each displaying a distinct set of behaviours. The dynamics of the system are driven by an interplay between the formation of, and transition between, unique stable states that arise as the network is varied. We show how the flow of objects across the network can be understood in terms of the ordering and allocation of strategies. Our results show that the existence of congestion in a network is a dynamic process that is as much dependent on the agents' decisions as it is on the structure of the network itself.

010       Interplay between function and structure in complex networks
021       We show that abrupt structural transitions can arise in functionally optimal networks, driven by small changes in the level of transport congestion. 
020       Our results offer an explanation as to why so many diverse species of network structure arise in Nature (e.g. fungal systems) under essentially the same environmental conditions. Our findings are based on an exactly solvable model system which mimics a variety of biological and social networks. We then extend our analysis by introducing a novel renormalization scheme involving cost motifs, to describe analytically the average shortest path across multiple-ring-and-hub networks. As a consequence, we uncover a 'skin effect' whereby the structure of the inner multi-ring core can cease to play any role in terms of determining the average shortest path across the network.

010       Exploring Complex Networks through Random Walks
021       Most real complex networks -- such as protein interactions, social contacts, the internet -- are only partially known and available to us. 
020       While the process of exploring such networks in many cases resembles a random walk, it becomes a key issue to investigate and characterize how effectively the nodes and edges of such networks can be covered by different strategies. At the same time, it is critically important to infer how well can topological measurements such as the average node degree and average clustering coefficient be estimated during such network explorations. The present article addresses these problems by considering random and Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) network models with varying connectivity explored by three types of random walks: traditional, preferential to untracked edges, and preferential to unvisited nodes. A series of relevant results are obtained, including the fact that random and BA models with the same size and average node degree allow similar node and edge coverage efficiency, the identification of linear scaling with the size of the network of the random walk step at which a given percentage of the nodes/edges is covered, and the critical result that the estimation of the averaged node degree and clustering coefficient by random walks on BA networks often leads to heavily biased results. Many are the theoretical and practical implications of such results.

010       Sparse repulsive coupling enhances synchronization in complex networks
021       Through the last years, different strategies to enhance synchronization in complex networks have been proposed. 
020       In this Letter, we show that the synchronization in a small-world network of attractively coupled non-identical neurons is strongly improved by adding a tiny fraction of phase-repulsive couplings. By a purely topological analysis that does not depend on the dynamical model, we link the emerging dynamical behavior to the structural properties of the sparsely coupled repulsive network.

010       Fractality in complex networks: critical and supercritical skeletons
021       Fractal scaling--a power-law behavior of the number of boxes needed to tile a given network with respect to the lateral size of the box--is studied. 
020       We introduce a new box-covering algorithm that is a modified version of the original algorithm introduced by Song et al. [Nature (London) 433, 392 (2005)]; this algorithm enables effective computation and easy implementation. Fractal networks are viewed as comprising a skeleton and shortcuts. The skeleton, embedded underneath the original network, is a special type of spanning tree based on the edge betweenness centrality; it provides a scaffold for the fractality of the network. When the skeleton is regarded as a branching tree, it exhibits a plateau in the mean branching number as a function of the distance from a root. Based on these observations, we construct a fractal network model by combining a random branching tree and local shortcuts. The scaffold branching tree can be either critical or supercritical, depending on the small-worldness of a given network. For the network constructed from the critical (supercritical) branching tree, the average number of vertices within a given box grows with the lateral size of the box according to a power-law (an exponential) form in the cluster-growing method. The distribution of box masses, i.e., the number of vertices within each box, follows a power law P_m(M) sim M^{-eta}. The exponent eta depends on the box lateral size ell_B. For small values of ell_B, eta is equal to the degree exponent gamma of a given scale-free network, whereas eta approaches the exponent tau=gamma/(gamma-1) as ell_B increases, which is the exponent of the cluster-size distribution of the random branching tree. We also study the perimeter of a given box as a function of the box mass.

010       Variational principle for the Pareto power law
021       A mechanism is proposed for the appearance of power law distributions in various complex systems. 
020       It is shown that in a conservative mechanical system composed of subsystems with different numbers of degrees of freedom a robust power-law tail can appear in the equilibrium distribution of energy as a result of certain superpositions of the canonical equilibrium energy densities of the subsystems. The derivation only uses a variational principle based on the Boltzmann entropy, without assumptions outside the framework of canonical equilibrium statistical mechanics. Two examples are discussed, free diffusion on a complex network and a kinetic model of wealth exchange. The mechanism is illustrated in the general case through an exactly solvable mechanical model of a dimensionally heterogeneous system.

We then present a model with global redistribution of the load when a link in the system fails which reproduces the power law from the Norwegian power grid if the simulation are carried out on the Norwegian high-voltage power grid. The model is also applied to regular and irregular networks and give power laws with exponents $-2.0\pm0.05$ for the regular networks and $-1.5\pm0.05$ for the irregular networks. A presented mean field theory is in good agreement with these numerical results.

021       We consider the problem of maximizing the synchronizability of oscillator networks by assigning weights and directions to the links of a given interaction topology. 
020       We first extend the well-known master stability formalism to the case of non-diagonalizable networks. We then show that, unless some oscillator is connected to all the others, networks of maximum synchronizability are necessarily non-diagonalizable and can always be obtained by imposing unidirectional information flow with normalized input strengths. The extension makes the formalism applicable to all possible network structures, while the maximization results provide insights into hierarchical structures observed in complex networks in which synchronization plays a significant role.

010       Network properties of written human language
021       We investigate the nature of written human language within the framework of complex network theory. 
020       In particular, we analyse the topology of Orwell's \textit{1984} focusing on the local properties of the network, such as the properties of the nearest neighbors and the clustering coefficient. We find a composite power law behavior for both the average nearest neighbor's degree and average clustering coefficient as a function of the vertex degree. This implies the existence of different functional classes of vertices. Furthermore we find that the second order vertex correlations are an essential component of the network architecture. To model our empirical results we extend a previously introduced model for language due to Dorogovtsev and Mendes. We propose an accelerated growing network model that contains three growth mechanisms: linear preferential attachment, local preferential attachment and the random growth of a pre-determined small finite subset of initial vertices. We find that with these elementary stochastic rules we are able to produce a network showing syntactic-like structures.

010       Finding community structure in networks using the eigenvectors of   matrices
021       We consider the problem of detecting communities or modules in networks, groups of vertices with a higher-than-average density of edges connecting them. 
020       Previous work indicates that a robust approach to this problem is the maximization of the benefit function known as "modularity" over possible divisions of a network. Here we show that this maximization process can be written in terms of the eigenspectrum of a matrix we call the modularity matrix, which plays a role in community detection similar to that played by the graph Laplacian in graph partitioning calculations. This result leads us to a number of possible algorithms for detecting community structure, as well as several other results, including a spectral measure of bipartite structure in networks and a new centrality measure that identifies those vertices that occupy central positions within the communities to which they belong. The algorithms and measures proposed are illustrated with applications to a variety of real-world complex networks.

010       Statistical Self-Similar Properties of Complex Networks
021       It has been shown that many complex networks shared distinctive features, which differ in many ways from the random and the regular networks. 
020       Although these features capture important characteristics of complex networks, their applicability depends on the type of networks. To unravel ubiquitous characteristics that complex networks may have in common, we adopt the clustering coefficient as the probability measure, and present a systematic analysis of various types of complex networks from the perspective of statistical self-similarity. We find that the probability distribution of the clustering coefficient is best characterized by the multifractal; moreover, the support of the measure had a fractal dimension. These two features enable us to describe complex networks in a unified way; at the same time, offer unforeseen possibilities to comprehend complex networks.

010       Correlations among centrality measures in complex networks
021       In this paper, we empirically investigate correlations among four centrality measures, originated from the social science, of various complex networks. 
020       For each network, we compute the centrality measures, from which the partial correlation as well as the correlation coefficient among measures is estimated. We uncover that the degree and the betweenness centrality are highly correlated; furthermore, the betweenness follows a power-law distribution irrespective of the type of networks. This characteristic is further examined in terms of the conditional probability distribution of the betweenness, given the degree. The conditional distribution also exhibits a power-law behavior independent of the degree which explains partially, if not whole, the origin of the power-law distribution of the betweenness. A similar analysis on the random network reveals that these characteristics are not found in the random network.

010       Integrating static and dynamic information for routing traffic
021       The efficiency of traffic routing on complex networks can be reflected by two key measurements i.e. 
020       the system capacity and the average data packets travel time. In this paper, we propose a mixing routing strategy by integrating local static and dynamic information for enhancing the efficiency of traffic on scale-free networks. The strategy is governed by a single parameter. Simulation results show that there exists a optimal parameter value by considering both maximizing the network capacity and reducing the packet travel time. Comparing with the strategy by adopting exclusive local static information, the new strategy shows its advantages in improving the efficiency of the system. The detailed analysis of the mixing strategy is provided. This work suggests that how to effectively utilize the larger degree nodes plays the key role in the scale-free traffic systems.

We show how our characterization of the dynamical importance of nodes can be affected by degree-degree correlations and network community structure. We discuss how our characterization can be used to optimize techniques for controlling certain network dynamical processes and apply our results to real networks.

010       When are networks truly modular?
021       Study of the cluster- or community structure of complex networks makes an important contribution to the understanding of networks at a functional level. 
020       Despite the many efforts, no definition of community has been agreed on and important aspects such as the statistical significance and theoretical limits of community detection are not well understood. We show how the problem of community detection can be mapped onto finding the ground state of an infinite range spin glass. The ground state energy then corresponds directly to the quality of the partition. The network modularity Q previously defined by Girvan and Newman [Phys. Rev. E, 69, 026113 (2004)] turns out to be a special case of this spin glass energy. Through this spin glass analogy, we are able to give expectation values for the modularity of random graphs that can be used in the assessment of the statistical significance of real network clusterings. Further, it allows for assessing the theoretical limits of community detection.

010       Degree distribution of complex networks from statistical mechanics   principles
021       In this paper we describe the emergence of scale-free degree distributions from statistical mechanics principles. 
020       We define an energy associated to a degree sequence as the logarithm of the number of indistinguishable simple networks it is possible to draw given the degree sequence. Keeping fixed the total number of nodes and links, we show that the energy of scale-free distribution is much higher than the energy associated to the degree sequence of regular random graphs. This results unable us to estimate the annealed average of the number of distinguishable simple graphs it is possible to draw given a scale-free distribution with structural cutoff. In particular we shaw that this number for large networks is strongly suppressed for power -law exponent \gamma-&gt;2.

010       Deducing Local Rules for Solving Global Tasks with Random Boolean   Networks
021       It has been shown that uniform as well as non-uniform cellular automata (CA) can be evolved to perform certain computational tasks. 
020       Random Boolean networks are a generalization of two-state cellular automata, where the interconnection topology and the cell's rules are specified at random. Here we present a novel analytical approach to find the local rules of random Boolean networks (RBNs) to solve the global density classification and the synchronization task from any initial configuration. We quantitatively and qualitatively compare our results with previously published work on cellular automata and show that randomly interconnected automata are computationally more efficient in solving these two global tasks. Our approach also provides convergence and quality estimates and allows the networks to be randomly rewired during operation, without affecting the global performance. Finally, we show that RBNs outperform small-world topologies on the density classification task and that they perform equally well on the synchronization task. Our novel approach and the results may have applications in designing robust complex networks and locally interacting distributed computing systems for solving global tasks.

010       Nonlinear Diffusion Through Large Complex Networks Containing Regular   Subgraphs
021       Transport through generalized trees is considered. 
020       Trees contain the simple nodes and supernodes, either well-structured regular subgraphs or those with many triangles. We observe a superdiffusion for the highly connected nodes while it is Brownian for the rest of the nodes. Transport within a supernode is affected by the finite size effects vanishing as $N\to\infty.$ For the even dimensions of space, $d=2,4,6,...$, the finite size effects break down the perturbation theory at small scales and can be regularized by using the heat-kernel expansion.

010       Temperature in complex networks
021       Various statistical-mechanics approaches to complex networks have been proposed to describe expected topological properties in terms of ensemble averages. 
020       Here we extend this formalism by introducing the fundamental concept of graph temperature, controlling the degree of topological optimization of a network. We recover the temperature-dependent version of various important models as particular cases of our approach, and show examples where, remarkably, the onset of a percolation transition, a scale-free degree distribution, correlations and clustering can be understood as natural properties of an optimized (low-temperature) topology. We then apply our formalism to real weighted networks and we compute their temperature, finding that various techniques used to extract information from complex networks are again particular cases of our approach.

010       Complexity characteristics of currency networks
021       A large set of daily FOREX time series is analyzed. 
020       The corresponding correlation matrices (CM) are constructed for USD, EUR and PLZ used as the base currencies. The triangle rule is interpreted as constraints reducing the number of independent returns. The CM spectrum is computed and compared with the cases of shuffled currencies and a fictitious random currency taken as a base currency. The Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) graphs are calculated and the clustering effects for strong currencies are found. It is shown that for MSTs the node rank has power like, scale free behavior. Finally, the scaling exponents are evaluated and found in the range analogous to those identified recently for various complex networks.

010       Analysis and Synthesis of the Distribution of Consonants over Languages:   A Complex Network Approach
021       Cross-linguistic similarities are reflected by the speech sound systems of languages all over the world. 
020       In this work we try to model such similarities observed in the consonant inventories, through a complex bipartite network. We present a systematic study of some of the appealing features of these inventories with the help of the bipartite network. An important observation is that the occurrence of consonants follows a two regime power law distribution. We find that the consonant inventory size distribution together with the principle of preferential attachment are the main reasons behind the emergence of such a two regime behavior. In order to further support our explanation we present a synthesis model for this network based on the general theory of preferential attachment.

010       Modeling the Co-occurrence Principles of the Consonant Inventories: A   Complex Network Approach
021       Speech sounds of the languages all over the world show remarkable patterns of cooccurrence. 
020       In this work, we attempt to automatically capture the patterns of cooccurrence of the consonants across languages and at the same time figure out the nature of the force leading to the emergence of such patterns. For this purpose we define a weighted network where the consonants are the nodes and an edge between two nodes (read consonants) signify their co-occurrence likelihood over the consonant inventories. Through this network we identify communities of consonants that essentially reflect their patterns of co-occurrence across languages. We test the goodness of the communities and observe that the constituent consonants frequently occur in such groups in real languages also. Interestingly, the consonants forming these communities reflect strong correlations in terms of their features, which indicate that the principle of feature economy acts as a driving force towards community formation. In order to measure the strength of this force we propose an information theoretic definition of feature economy and show that indeed the feature economy exhibited by the consonant communities are substantially better than those if the consonant inventories had evolved just by chance.

010       Transport on Complex Networks: Flow, Jamming and Optimization
021       Many transport processes on networks depend crucially on the underlying network geometry, although the exact relationship between the structure of the network and the properties of transport processes remain elusive. 
020       In this paper we address this question by using numerical models in which both structure and dynamics are controlled systematically. We consider the traffic of information packets that include driving, searching and queuing. We present the results of extensive simulations on two classes of networks; a correlated cyclic scale-free network and an uncorrelated homogeneous weakly clustered network. By measuring different dynamical variables in the free flow regime we show how the global statistical properties of the transport are related to the temporal fluctuations at individual nodes (the traffic noise) and the links (the traffic flow). We then demonstrate that these two network classes appear as representative topologies for optimal traffic flow in the regimes of low density and high density traffic, respectively. We also determine statistical indicators of the pre-jamming regime on different network geometries and discuss the role of queuing and dynamical betweenness for the traffic congestion. The transition to the jammed traffic regime at a critical posting rate on different network topologies is studied as a phase transition with an appropriate order parameter. We also address several open theoretical problems related to the network dynamics.

010       Designing Complex Networks
021       We suggest a new perspective of research towards understanding the relations between structure and dynamics of a complex network: Can we design a network, e.g. 
020       by modifying the features of units or interactions, such that it exhibits a desired dynamics? Here we present a case study where we positively answer this question analytically for networks of spiking neural oscillators. First, we present a method of finding the set of all networks (defined by all mutual coupling strengths) that exhibit an arbitrary given periodic pattern of spikes as an invariant solution. In such a pattern all the spike times of all the neurons are exactly predefined. The method is very general as it covers networks of different types of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory couplings, interaction delays that may be heterogeneously distributed, and arbitrary network connectivities. Second, we show how to design networks if further restrictions are imposed, for instance by predefining the detailed network connectivity. We illustrate the applicability of the method by examples of Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and power-law random networks. Third, the method can be used to design networks that optimize network properties. To illustrate this idea, we design networks that exhibit a predefined pattern dynamics while at the same time minimizing the networks' wiring costs.

010       Optimal routing on complex networks
021       We present a novel heuristic algorithm for routing optimization on complex networks. 
020       Previously proposed routing optimization algorithms aim at avoiding or reducing link overload. Our algorithm balances traffic on a network by minimizing the maximum node betweenness with as little path lengthening as possible, thus being useful in cases when networks are jamming due to queuing overload. By using the resulting routing table, a network can sustain significantly higher traffic without jamming than in the case of traditional shortest path routing.

010       Oscillations of complex networks
021       A complex network processing information or physical flows is usually characterized by a number of macroscopic quantities such as the diameter and the betweenness centrality. 
020       An issue of significant theoretical and practical interest is how such a network responds to sudden changes caused by attacks or disturbances. By introducing a model to address this issue, we find that, for a finite-capacity network, perturbations can cause the network to \emph{oscillate} persistently in the sense that the characterizing quantities vary periodically or randomly with time. We provide a theoretical estimate of the critical capacity-parameter value for the onset of the network oscillation. The finding is expected to have broad implications as it suggests that complex networks may be structurally highly dynamic.

010       New Model of Internet Topology Using k-shell Decomposition
021       We introduce and use k-shell decomposition to investigate the topology of the Internet at the AS level. 
020       Our analysis separates the Internet into three sub-components: (a) a nucleus which is a small (~100 nodes) very well connected globally distributed subgraph; (b) a fractal sub-component that is able to connect the bulk of the Internet without congesting the nucleus, with self similar properties and critical exponents; and (c) dendrite-like structures, usually isolated nodes that are connected to the rest of the network through the nucleus only. This unique decomposition is robust, and provides insight into the underlying structure of the Internet and its functional consequences. Our approach is general and useful also when studying other complex networks.

010       Non-equilibrium dynamics of language games on complex networks
021       The Naming Game is a model of non-equilibrium dynamics for the self-organized emergence of a linguistic convention or a communication system in a population of agents with pairwise local interactions. 
020       We present an extensive study of its dynamics on complex networks, that can be considered as the most natural topological embedding for agents involved in language games and opinion dynamics. Except for some community structured networks on which metastable phases can be observed, agents playing the Naming Game always manage to reach a global consensus. This convergence is obtained after a time generically scaling with the population's size $N$ as $t\_{conv} \sim N^{1.4 \pm 0.1}$, i.e. much faster than for agents embedded on regular lattices. Moreover, the memory capacity required by the system scales only linearly with its size. Particular attention is given to heterogenous networks, in which the dynamical activity pattern of a node depends on its degree. High degree nodes have a fundamental role, but require larger memory capacity. They govern the dynamics acting as spreaders of (linguistic) conventions. The effects of other properties, such as the average degree and the clustering, are also discussed.

010       Resolution limit in community detection
021       Detecting community structure is fundamental to clarify the link between structure and function in complex networks and is used for practical applications in many disciplines. 
020       A successful method relies on the optimization of a quantity called modularity [Newman and Girvan, Phys. Rev. E 69, 026113 (2004)], which is a quality index of a partition of a network into communities. We find that modularity optimization may fail to identify modules smaller than a scale which depends on the total number L of links of the network and on the degree of interconnectedness of the modules, even in cases where modules are unambiguously defined. The probability that a module conceals well-defined substructures is the highest if the number of links internal to the module is of the order of \sqrt{2L} or smaller. We discuss the practical consequences of this result by analyzing partitions obtained through modularity optimization in artificial and real networks.

021       In complex networks a common task is to identify the most important or "central" nodes. 
020       There are several definitions, often called centrality measures, which often lead to different results. Here we study extensively correlations between four local and global measures namely the degree, the shortest-path-betweenness, the random-walk betweenness and the subgraph centrality on different random-network models like Erdos-Renyi, Small-World and Barabasi-Albert as well as on different real networks like metabolic pathways, social collaborations and computer networks. Correlations are quite different between the real networks and the model networks questioning whether the models really reflect all important properties of the real world.

The algorithm attains a high level of precision, especially when the modular units are very mixed and hardly detectable by the other methods, with a computational effort ${\cal O}(KN)$ on a generic graph with $N$ nodes and $K$ links.

010       Paths to Synchronization on Complex Networks
021       The understanding of emergent collective phenomena in natural and social systems has driven the interest of scientists from different disciplines during decades. 
020       Among these phenomena, the synchronization of a set of interacting individuals or units has been intensively studied because of its ubiquity in the natural world. In this paper, we show how for fixed coupling strengths local patterns of synchronization emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks, driving the process towards a certain global synchronization degree following different paths. The dependence of the dynamics on the coupling strength and on the topology is unveiled. This study provides a new perspective and tools to understand this emerging phenomena.

010       Clustering in complex networks. I. General formalism
021       We develop a full theoretical approach to clustering in complex networks. 
020       A key concept is introduced, the edge multiplicity, that measures the number of triangles passing through an edge. This quantity extends the clustering coefficient in that it involves the properties of two --and not just one-- vertices. The formalism is completed with the definition of a three-vertex correlation function, which is the fundamental quantity describing the properties of clustered networks. The formalism suggests new metrics that are able to thoroughly characterize transitive relations. A rigorous analysis of several real networks, which makes use of the new formalism and the new metrics, is also provided. It is also found that clustered networks can be classified into two main groups: the {\it weak} and the {\it strong transitivity} classes. In the first class, edge multiplicity is small, with triangles being disjoint. In the second class, edge multiplicity is high and so triangles share many edges.

010       Clustering in complex networks. II. Percolation properties
021       The percolation properties of clustered networks are analyzed in detail. 
020       In the case of weak clustering, we present an analytical approach that allows to find the critical threshold and the size of the giant component. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of our results. In more general terms, we show that weak clustering hinders the onset of the giant component whereas strong clustering favors its appearance. This is a direct consequence of the differences in the $k$-core structure of the networks, which are found to be totally different depending on the level of clustering. An empirical analysis of a real social network confirms our predictions.

010       Multicomponent reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks
021       We study the reaction-diffusion process $A + B \to \emptyset$ on uncorrelated scale-free networks analytically. 
020       By a mean-field ansatz we derive analytical expressions for the particle pair-correlations and the particle density. Expressing the time evolution of the particle density in terms of the instantaneous particle pair-correlations, we determine analytically the `jamming' effect which arises in the case of multicomponent, pair-wise reactions. Comparing the relevant terms within the differential equation for the particle density, we find that the `jamming' effect diminishes in the long-time, low-density limit. This even holds true for the hubs of the network, despite that the hubs dynamically attract the particles.

010       Generalizations of the clustering coefficient to weighted complex   networks
021       The recent high level of interest in weighted complex networks gives rise to a need to develop new measures and to generalize existing ones to take the weights of links into account. 
020       Here we focus on various generalizations of the clustering coefficient, which is one of the central characteristics in the complex network theory. We present a comparative study of the several suggestions introduced in the literature, and point out their advantages and limitations. The concepts are illustrated by simple examples as well as by empirical data of the world trade and weighted coauthorship networks.

010       Local symmetries in complex networks
021       Symmetry -- invariance to certain operators -- is a fundamental concept in many branches of physics. 
020       We propose ways to measure symmetric properties of vertices, and their surroundings, in networks. To be stable to the randomness inherent in many complex networks, we consider measures that are continuous rather than dichotomous. The main operator we suggest is permutations of the paths of a certain length leading out from a vertex. If these paths are more similar (in some sense) than expected, the vertex is a local center of symmetry in networks. We discuss different precise definitions based on this idea and give examples how different symmetry coefficients can be applied to protein interaction networks.

010       Post-Processing Hierarchical Community Structures: Quality Improvements   and Multi-scale View
021       Dense sub-graphs of sparse graphs (communities), which appear in most real-world complex networks, play an important role in many contexts. 
020       Most existing community detection algorithms produce a hierarchical structure of community and seek a partition into communities that optimizes a given quality function. We propose new methods to improve the results of any of these algorithms. First we show how to optimize a general class of additive quality functions (containing the modularity, the performance, and a new similarity based quality function we propose) over a larger set of partitions than the classical methods. Moreover, we define new multi-scale quality functions which make it possible to detect the different scales at which meaningful community structures appear, while classical approaches find only one partition.

021       We apply random matrix theory to complex networks. 
020       We show that nearest neighbor spacing distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of various model networks, namely scale-free, small-world and random networks follow universal Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics of random matrix theory. Secondly we show an analogy between the onset of small-world behavior, quantified by the structural properties of networks, and the transition from Poisson to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, quantified by Brody parameter characterizing a spectral property. We also present our analysis for a protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.

010       Topology of Foreign Exchange Markets using Hierarchical Structure   Methods
021       This paper uses two hierarchical techniques, a minimal spanning tree and an ultrametric hierarchical tree, to extract a topological influence map for major currencies from the ultrametric distance matrix for 1996-2001. 
020       We find that these two techniques generate a defined and robust scale free network with meaningful taxonomy. The topology is shown to be robust with respect to method, to time horizon and is stable during market crises. This topology, appropriately used, gives a guide to determining the underlying economic or regional causal relationships for individual currencies and will prove useful to understanding the dynamics of exchange rate price determination as part of a complex network.

010       Maximum likelihood: extracting unbiased information from complex   networks
021       The choice of free parameters in network models is subjective, since it depends on what topological properties are being monitored. 
020       However, we show that the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle indicates a unique, statistically rigorous parameter choice, associated to a well defined topological feature. We then find that, if the ML condition is incompatible with the built-in parameter choice, network models turn out to be intrinsically ill-defined or biased. To overcome this problem, we construct a class of safely unbiased models. We also propose an extension of these results that leads to the fascinating possibility to extract, only from topological data, the `hidden variables' underlying network organization, making them `no more hidden'. We test our method on the World Trade Web data, where we recover the empirical Gross Domestic Product using only topological information.

010       Transport of multiple users in complex networks
021       We study the transport properties of model networks such as scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks as well as a real network. 
020       We consider the conductance $G$ between two arbitrarily chosen nodes where each link has the same unit resistance. Our theoretical analysis for scale-free networks predicts a broad range of values of $G$, with a power-law tail distribution $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)\sim G^{-g_G}$, where $g_G=2\lambda -1$, and $\lambda$ is the decay exponent for the scale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our predictions by large scale simulations. The power-law tail in $\Phi_{\rm SF}(G)$ leads to large values of $G$, thereby significantly improving the transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks where the tail of the conductivity distribution decays exponentially. We develop a simple physical picture of the transport to account for the results. We study another model for transport, the \emph{max-flow} model, where conductance is defined as the number of link-independent paths between the two nodes, and find that a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the value of conductance are considered for both models, and some differences emerge. We then extend our study to the case of multiple sources, where the transport is define between two \emph{groups} of nodes. We find a fundamental difference between the two forms of flow when considering the quality of the transport with respect to the number of sources, and find an optimal number of sources, or users, for the max-flow case. A qualitative (and partially quantitative) explanation is also given.

010       Synchronization in Weighted Uncorrelated Complex Networks in a Noisy   Environment: Optimization and Connections with Transport Efficiency
021       Motivated by synchronization problems in noisy environments, we study the Edwards-Wilkinson process on weighted uncorrelated scale-free networks. 
020       We consider a specific form of the weights, where the strength (and the associated cost) of a link is proportional to $(k_{i}k_{j})^{\beta}$ with $k_{i}$ and $k_{j}$ being the degrees of the nodes connected by the link. Subject to the constraint that the total network cost is fixed, we find that in the mean-field approximation on uncorrelated scale-free graphs, synchronization is optimal at $\beta^{*}$$=$-1. Numerical results, based on exact numerical diagonalization of the corresponding network Laplacian, confirm the mean-field results, with small corrections to the optimal value of $\beta^{*}$. Employing our recent connections between the Edwards-Wilkinson process and resistor networks, and some well-known connections between random walks and resistor networks, we also pursue a naturally related problem of optimizing performance in queue-limited communication networks utilizing local weighted routing schemes.

010       Universal Scaling Behavior of Clustering Coefficient Induced by   Deactivation Mechanism
021       We propose a model of network growth that generalizes the deactivation model previously suggested for complex networks. 
020       Several topological features of this generalized model, such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficient, have been investigated analytically and by simulations. A scaling behavior of clustering coefficient $C \sim 1/M$ is theoretically obtained, where $M$ refers to the number of active nodes in the network. We discuss the relationship between the recently observed numerical behavior of clustering coefficient in the coauthor and paper citation networks and our theoretical result. It shows that both of them are induced by deactivation mechanism. By introducing a perturbation, the generated network undergoes a transition from large- to small-world, meanwhile the scaling behavior of $C$ is conserved. It indicates that $C \sim 1/M$ is a universal scaling behavior induced by deactivation mechanism.

010       Maximum Performance at Minimum Cost in Network Synchronization
021       We consider two optimization problems on synchronization of oscillator networks: maximization of synchronizability and minimization of synchronization cost. 
020       We first develop an extension of the well-known master stability framework to the case of non-diagonalizable Laplacian matrices. We then show that the solution sets of the two optimization problems coincide and are simultaneously characterized by a simple condition on the Laplacian eigenvalues. Among the optimal networks, we identify a subclass of hierarchical networks, characterized by the absence of feedback loops and the normalization of inputs. We show that most optimal networks are directed and non-diagonalizable, necessitating the extension of the framework. We also show how oriented spanning trees can be used to explicitly and systematically construct optimal networks under network topological constraints. Our results may provide insights into the evolutionary origin of structures in complex networks for which synchronization plays a significant role.

010       Measuring Fundamental Properties of Real-World Complex Networks
021       Complex networks, modeled as large graphs, received much attention during these last years. 
020       However, data on such networks is only available through intricate measurement procedures. Until recently, most studies assumed that these procedures eventually lead to samples large enough to be representative of the whole, at least concerning some key properties. This has crucial impact on network modeling and simulation, which rely on these properties. <br />Recent contributions proved that this approach may be misleading, but no solution has been proposed. We provide here the first practical way to distinguish between cases where it is indeed misleading, and cases where the observed properties may be trusted. It consists in studying how the properties of interest evolve when the sample grows, and in particular whether they reach a steady state or not. <br />In order to illustrate this method and to demonstrate its relevance, we apply it to data-sets on complex network measurements that are representative of the ones commonly used. The obtained results show that the method fulfills its goals very well. We moreover identify some properties which seem easier to evaluate in practice, thus opening interesting perspectives.

021       Finding, counting and/or listing triangles (three vertices with three edges) in large graphs are natural fundamental problems, which received recently much attention because of their importance in complex network analysis. 
020       We provide here a detailed state of the art on these problems, in a unified way. We note that, until now, authors paid surprisingly little attention to space complexity, despite its both fundamental and practical interest. We give the space complexities of known algorithms and discuss their implications. Then we propose improvements of a known algorithm, as well as a new algorithm, which are time optimal for triangle listing and beats previous algorithms concerning space complexity. They have the additional advantage of performing better on power-law graphs, which we also study. We finally show with an experimental study that these two algorithms perform very well in practice, allowing to handle cases that were previously out of reach.

010       A Formal Treatment of Generalized Preferential Attachment and its   Empirical Validation
021       Generalized preferential attachment is defined as the tendency of a vertex to acquire new links in the future with respect to a particular vertex property. 
020       Understanding which properties influence link acquisition tendency (LAT) gives us a predictive power to estimate the future growth of network and insight about the actual dynamics governing the complex networks. In this study, we explore the effect of age and degree on LAT by analyzing data collected from a new complex-network growth dataset. We found that LAT and degree of a vertex are linearly correlated in accordance with previous studies. Interestingly, the relation between LAT and age of a vertex is found to be in conflict with the known models of network growth. We identified three different periods in the network's lifetime where the relation between age and LAT is strongly positive, almost stationary and negative correspondingly.

010       Analyzing Trails in Complex Networks
021       Even more interesting than the intricate organization of complex networks are the dynamical behavior of systems which such structures underly. 
020       Among the many types of dynamics, one particularly interesting category involves the evolution of trails left by moving agents progressing through random walks and dilating processes in a complex network. The emergence of trails is present in many dynamical process, such as pedestrian traffic, information flow and metabolic pathways. Important problems related with trails include the reconstruction of the trail and the identification of its source, when complete knowledge of the trail is missing. In addition, the following of trails in multi-agent systems represent a particularly interesting situation related to pedestrian dynamics and swarming intelligence. The present work addresses these three issues while taking into account permanent and transient marks left in the visited nodes. Different topologies are considered for trail reconstruction and trail source identification, including four complex networks models and four real networks, namely the Internet, the US airlines network, an email network and the scientific collaboration network of complex network researchers. Our results show that the topology of the network influence in trail reconstruction, source identification and agent dynamics.

010       The intermodal networks: a survey on intermodalism
021       A new and rather independent research field is now emerging on intermodalism, because intermodalism, that is the intermodal transportation, must study the behavior of systems different from single-mode transport systems. 
020       In fact, the importance of this new research field, its potential interdisciplinary of modeling the problem with the science of complex networks, are not yet completely appreciated by the scientific community. This is due to several reasons, among others the lack of a common background and a rather cumbersome approach of operation research to the modeling of transportation. In this paper we review the concept of intermodalism and the approach to intermodalism in the operation research field. Then we discuss the intermodal networks in the framework of real world networks to understand the behavior of intermodal systems as a whole.

010       The Flow Dimension and Capacity for Structuring Urban Street Networks
021       This paper aims to measure the efficiency of urban street networks (a kind of complex networks) from the perspective of the multidimensional chain of connectivity (or flow). 
020       More specifically, we define two quantities: flow dimension and flow capacity, to characterize structures of urban street networks. To our surprise for the topologies of urban street networks, previously confirmed as a form of small world and scale-free networks, we find that (1) the range of their flow dimension is rather wider than their random and regular counterparts, (2) their flow dimension shows a power-law distribution, and (3) they have a higher flow capacity than their random and regular counterparts. The findings confirm that (1) both the wider range of flow dimension and the higher flow capacity can be a signature of small world networks, and (2) the flow capacity can be an alternative quantity for measuring the efficiency of networks or that of the individual nodes. The findings are illustrated using three urban street networks (two in the Europe and one in the USA).

010       On the Dynamics of the $h-$index in Complex Networks with Coexisting   Communities
021       This article investigates the evolution of the $h-$index in a complex network including two communities (in the sense of having different features) with the same number of authors whose yearly productions follow the Zipf's law. 
020       Models considering indiscriminate citations, as well as citations preferential to the fitness values of each community and/or the number of existing citations are proposed and numerically simulated. The $h-$indices of each type of author is estimated along a period of 20 years, while the number of authors remains constant. Interesting results are obtained including the fact that, for the model where citations are preferential to both community fitness and number of existing citations per article, the $h-$indices of the community with the largest fitness value are only moderately increased while the indices of the other community are severely and irreversibly limited to low values. Three possible strategies are discussed in order to change this situation. In addition, based on such findings, a new version of the $h-$index is proposed involving the automated identification of virtual citations which can provide complementary and unbiased quantification of the relevance of scientific works.

010       Dynamical Phenomena on Complex Networks
021       The work presented in this thesis concerns different aspects of dynamical processes on networks. 
020       The first subject considered is the theoretical modeling of exploration processes of complex networks, such as the ``traceroute'' process used to map the Internet. Our mean-field analysis of the traceroute model provides a better understanding of the Internet topology. A second part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the weighted representation of networks and their relations with the functional properties of infrastructure systems (e.g. the airports network). Other results concerning spreading processes and percolation on weighted networks are presented. Finally, we turns to social networks, introducing the Naming Game, a model for the emergence of a communication system in a structured population of individuals. We show that the dynamical phenomena generated by this model depend strongly on the topology of the interactions.

010       Synchronization Properties of Network Motifs
021       We address the problem of understanding the variable abundance of 3-node and 4-node subgraphs (motifs) in complex networks from a dynamical point of view. 
020       As a criterion in the determination of the functional significance of a n-node subgraph, we propose an analytic method to measure the stability of the synchronous state (SSS) the subgraph displays. We show that, for undirected graphs, the SSS is correlated with the relative abundance, while in directed graphs the correlation exists only for some specific motifs.

010       Optimal Paths in Complex Networks with Correlated Weights: The   World-wide Airport Network
021       We study complex networks with weights, $w_{ij}$, associated with each link connecting node $i$ and $j$. 
020       The weights are chosen to be correlated with the network topology in the form found in two real world examples, (a) the world-wide airport network, and (b) the {\it E. Coli} metabolic network. Here $w_{ij} \sim x_{ij} (k_i k_j)^\alpha$, where $k_i$ and $k_j$ are the degrees of nodes $i$ and $j$, $x_{ij}$ is a random number and $\alpha$ represents the strength of the correlations. The case $\alpha &gt; 0$ represents correlation between weights and degree, while $\alpha &lt; 0$ represents anti-correlation and the case $\alpha = 0$ reduces to the case of no correlations. We study the scaling of the lengths of the optimal paths, $\ell_{\rm opt}$, with the system size $N$ in strong disorder for scale-free networks for different $\alpha$. We calculate the robustness of correlated scale-free networks with different $\alpha$, and find the networks with $\alpha &lt; 0$ to be the most robust networks when compared to the other values of $\alpha$. We propose an analytical method to study percolation phenomena on networks with this kind of correlation. We compare our simulation results with the real world-wide airport network, and we find good agreement.

010       Dynamic behaviors in directed networks
021       Motivated by the abundance of directed synaptic couplings in a real biological neuronal network, we investigate the synchronization behavior of the Hodgkin-Huxley model in a directed network. 
020       We start from the standard model of the Watts-Strogatz undirected network and then change undirected edges to directed arcs with a given probability, still preserving the connectivity of the network. A generalized clustering coefficient for directed networks is defined and used to investigate the interplay between the synchronization behavior and underlying structural properties of directed networks. We observe that the directedness of complex networks plays an important role in emerging dynamical behaviors, which is also confirmed by a numerical study of the sociological game theoretic voter model on directed networks.

010       Using graph concepts to understand the organization of complex systems
021       Complex networks are universal, arising in fields as disparate as sociology, physics, and biology. 
020       In the past decade, extensive research into the properties and behaviors of complex systems has uncovered surprising commonalities among the topologies of different systems. Attempts to explain these similarities have led to the ongoing development and refinement of network models and graph-theoretical analysis techniques with which to characterize and understand complexity. In this tutorial, we demonstrate through illustrative examples, how network measures and models have contributed to the elucidation of the organization of complex systems.

010       Limited resolution in complex network community detection with Potts   model approach
021       According to Fortunato and Barthelemy, modularity-based community detection algorithms have a resolution threshold such that small communities in a large network are invisible. 
020       Here we generalize their work and show that the q-state Potts community detection method introduced by Reichardt and Bornholdt also has a resolution threshold. The model contains a parameter by which this threshold can be tuned, but no a priori principle is known to select the proper value. Single global optimization criteria do not seem capable for detecting all communities if their size distribution is broad.

010       Synchronization and modularity in complex networks
021       We investigate the connection between the dynamics of synchronization and the modularity on complex networks. 
020       Simulating the Kuramoto's model in complex networks we determine patterns of meta-stability and calculate the modularity of the partition these patterns provide. The results indicate that the more stable the patterns are, the larger tends to be the modularity of the partition defined by them. This correlation works pretty well in homogeneous networks (all nodes have similar connectivity) but fails when networks contain hubs, mainly because the modularity is never improved where isolated nodes appear, whereas in the synchronization process the characteristic of hubs is to have a large stability when forming its own community.

010       Mapping dynamical systems onto complex networks
021       A procedure to characterize chaotic dynamical systems with concepts of complex networks is pursued, in which a dynamical system is mapped onto a network. 
020       The nodes represent the regions of space visited by the system, while edges represent the transitions between these regions. Parameters used to quantify the properties of complex networks, including those related to higher order neighborhoods, are used in the analysis. The methodology is tested for the logistic map, focusing the onset of chaos and chaotic regimes. It is found that the corresponding networks show distinct features, which are associated to the particular type of dynamics that have generated them.

010       A self-organized particle moving model on scale free network with   $1/f^{2}$ behavior
021       In this paper we propose a self-organized particle moving model on scale free network with the algorithm of the shortest path and preferential walk. 
020       The over-capacity property of the vertices in this particle moving system on complex network is studied from the holistic point of view. Simulation results show that the number of over-capacity vertices forms punctuated equilibrium processes as time elapsing, that the average number of over-capacity vertices under each local punctuated equilibrium process has power law relationship with the local punctuated equilibrium value. What's more, the number of over-capacity vertices has the bell-shaped temporal correlation and $1/f^{2}$ behavior. Finally, the average lifetime $L(t)$ of particles accumulated before time $t$ is analyzed to find the different roles of the shortest path algorithm and the preferential walk algorithm in our model.

010       2D pattern evolution constrained by complex network dynamics
021       Complex networks have established themselves along the last years as being particularly suitable and flexible for representing and modeling several complex natural and human-made systems. 
020       At the same time in which the structural intricacies of such networks are being revealed and understood, efforts have also been directed at investigating how such connectivity properties define and constrain the dynamics of systems unfolding on such structures. However, lesser attention has been focused on hybrid systems, \textit{i.e.} involving more than one type of network and/or dynamics. Because several real systems present such an organization (\textit{e.g.} the dynamics of a disease coexisting with the dynamics of the immune system), it becomes important to address such hybrid systems. The current paper investigates a specific system involving a diffusive (linear and non-linear) dynamics taking place in a regular network while interacting with a complex network of defensive agents following Erd\"os-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert graph models, whose nodes can be displaced spatially. More specifically, the complex network is expected to control, and if possible to extinguish, the diffusion of some given unwanted process (\textit{e.g.} fire, oil spilling, pest dissemination, and virus or bacteria reproduction during an infection). Two types of pattern evolution are considered: Fick and Gray-Scott. The nodes of the defensive network then interact with the diffusing patterns and communicate between themselves in order to control the spreading. The main findings include the identification of higher efficiency for the Barab\'asi-Albert control networks.

010       Error and Attack Tolerance of Layered Complex Networks
021       Many complex systems may be described not by one, but by a number of complex networks mapped one on the other in a multilayer structure. 
020       The interactions and dependencies between these layers cause that what is true for a distinct single layer does not necessarily reflect well the state of the entire system. In this paper we study the robustness of three real-life examples of two-layer complex systems that come from the fields of communication (the Internet), transportation (the European railway system) and biology (the human brain). In order to cover the whole range of features specific to these systems, we focus on two extreme policies of system's response to failures, no rerouting and full rerouting. Our main finding is that multilayer systems are much more vulnerable to errors and intentional attacks than they seem to be from a single layer perspective.

010       A fitness model for the Italian Interbank Money Market
021       We use the theory of complex networks in order to quantitatively characterize the formation of communities in a particular financial market. 
020       The system is composed by different banks exchanging on a daily basis loans and debts of liquidity. Through topological analysis and by means of a model of network growth we can determine the formation of different group of banks characterized by different business strategy. The model based on Pareto's Law makes no use of growth or preferential attachment and it reproduces correctly all the various statistical properties of the system. We believe that this network modeling of the market could be an efficient way to evaluate the impact of different policies in the market of liquidity.

010       Self-organization of the Sound Inventories: Analysis and Synthesis of   the Occurrence and Co-occurrence Networks of Consonants
021       The sound inventories of the world's languages self-organize themselves giving rise to similar cross-linguistic patterns. 
020       In this work we attempt to capture this phenomenon of self-organization, which shapes the structure of the consonant inventories, through a complex network approach. For this purpose we define the occurrence and co-occurrence networks of consonants and systematically study some of their important topological properties. A crucial observation is that the occurrence as well as the co-occurrence of consonants across languages follow a power law distribution. This property is arguably a consequence of the principle of preferential attachment. In order to support this argument we propose a synthesis model which reproduces the degree distribution for the networks to a close approximation. We further observe that the co-occurrence network of consonants show a high degree of clustering and subsequently refine our synthesis model in order to incorporate this property. Finally, we discuss how preferential attachment manifests itself through the evolutionary nature of language.

010       Quantifying Cosmic Superstructures
021       The Large Scale Structure (LSS) found in galaxy redshift surveys and in computer simulations of cosmic structure formation shows a very complex network of galaxy clusters, filaments, and sheets around large voids. 
020       Here, we introduce a new algorithm, based on a Minimal Spanning Tree, to find basic structural elements of this network and their properties. We demonstrate how the algorithm works using simple test cases and then apply it to haloes from the Millennium Run simulation (Springel et al. 2005). We show that about 70% of the total halo mass is contained in a structure composed of more than 74,000 individual elements, the vast majority of which are filamentary, with lengths of up to 15 Mpc/h preferred. Spatially more extended structures do exist, as do examples of what appear to be sheet-like configurations of matter. What is more, LSS appears to be composed of a fixed set of basic building blocks. The LSS formed by mass selected subsamples of haloes shows a clear correlation between the threshold mass and the mean extent of major branches, with cluster-size haloes forming structures whose branches can extend to almost 200 Mpc/h - the backbone of LSS to which smaller branches consisting of smaller haloes are attached.

010       Self-organized network evolution coupled to extremal dynamics
021       The interplay between topology and dynamics in complex networks is a fundamental but widely unexplored problem. 
020       Here, we study this phenomenon on a prototype model in which the network is shaped by a dynamical variable. We couple the dynamics of the Bak-Sneppen evolution model with the rules of the so-called fitness network model for establishing the topology of a network; each vertex is assigned a fitness, and the vertex with minimum fitness and its neighbours are updated in each iteration. At the same time, the links between the updated vertices and all other vertices are drawn anew with a fitness-dependent connection probability. We show analytically and numerically that the system self-organizes to a non-trivial state that differs from what is obtained when the two processes are decoupled. A power-law decay of dynamical and topological quantities above a threshold emerges spontaneously, as well as a feedback between different dynamical regimes and the underlying correlation and percolation properties of the network.

010       Anomalous electrical and frictionless flow conductance in complex   networks
021       We study transport properties such as electrical and frictionless flow conductance on scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks. 
020       We consider the conductance G between two arbitrarily chosen nodes where each link has the same unit resistance. Our theoretical analysis for scale-free networks predicts a broad range of values of G, with a power-law tail distribution \Phi_{SF}(G) \sim G^{g_G}, where g_G = 2\lambda - 1, where \lambda is the decay exponent for the scale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our predictions by simulations of scale-free networks solving the Kirchhoff equations for the conductance between a pair of nodes. The power-law tail in \Phi_{SF}(G) leads to large values of G, thereby significantly improving the transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erdos-Renyi networks where the tail of the conductivity distribution decays exponentially. Based on a simple physical 'transport backbone' picture we suggest that the conductances of scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks can be approximated by ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B) for any pair of nodes A and B with degrees k_A and k_B. Thus, a single quantity c, which depends on the average degree &lt;k&gt; of the network, characterizes transport on both scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks. We determine that c tends to 1 for increasing &lt;k&gt;, and it is larger for scale-free networks. We compare the electrical results with a model for frictionless transport, where conductance is defined as the number of link-independent paths between A and B, and find that a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the value of conductance are considered for both models, and some differences emerge. Finally, we use a recent data set for the AS (autonomous system) level of the Internet and confirm that our results are valid in this real-world example.

010       Basic Notions for the Analysis of Large Affiliation Networks / Bipartite   Graphs
021       Many real-world complex networks actually have a bipartite nature: their nodes may be separated into two classes, the links being between nodes of different classes only. 
020       Despite this, and despite the fact that many ad-hoc tools have been designed for the study of special cases, very few exist to analyse (describe, extract relevant information) such networks in a systematic way. We propose here an extension of the most basic notions used nowadays to analyse classical complex networks to the bipartite case. To achieve this, we introduce a set of simple statistics, which we discuss by comparing their values on a representative set of real-world networks and on their random versions.

020       The entry $w_{ij}$ in the weight matrix W holds information about the transmission probability along the edge joining node $v_i$ and node $v_j$. We use the analogy between the spread of a disease on a network and a random walk performed on this network to derive a master equation describing the dynamics of the process. We find conditions under which an epidemic does not break out and investigate numerically the effect of a non-symmetric weight distribution of the initially infected individual on the dynamics of the disease spread.

010       The effects of degree correlations on network topologies and robustness
021       Complex networks have been applied to model numerous interactive nonlinear systems in the real world. 
020       Knowledge about network topology is crucial for understanding the function, performance and evolution of complex systems. In the last few years, many network metrics and models have been proposed to illuminate the network topology, dynamics and evolution. Since these network metrics and models derive from a wide range of studies, a systematic study is required to investigate the correlations between them. The present paper explores the effect of degree correlation on the other network metrics through studying an ensemble of graphs where the degree sequence (set of degrees) is fixed. We show that to some extent, the characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, modular extent and robustness of networks are directly influenced by the degree correlation.

010       Correlations between structure and dynamics in complex networks
021       Previous efforts in complex networks research focused mainly on the topological features of such networks, but now also encompass the dynamics. 
020       In this Letter we discuss the relationship between structure and dynamics, with an emphasis on identifying whether a topological hub, i.e. a node with high degree or strength, is also a dynamical hub, i.e. a node with high activity. We employ random walk dynamics and establish the necessary conditions for a network to be topologically and dynamically fully correlated, with topological hubs that are also highly active. Zipf's law is then shown to be a reflection of the match between structure and dynamics in a fully correlated network, as well as a consequence of the rich-get-richer evolution inherent in scale-free networks. We also examine a number of real networks for correlations between topology and dynamics and find that many of them are not fully correlated.

010       From Centrality to Temporary Fame: Dynamic Centrality in Complex   Networks
021       We develop a new approach to the study of the dynamics of link utilization in complex networks using records of communication in a large social network. 
020       Counter to the perspective that nodes have particular roles, we find roles change dramatically from day to day. "Local hubs" have a power law degree distribution over time, with no characteristic degree value. Our results imply a significant reinterpretation of the concept of node centrality in complex networks, and among other conclusions suggest that interventions targeting hubs will have significantly less effect than previously thought.

010       Dynamics on Complex Networks and Applications
021       At the eight-year anniversary of Watts &amp; Strogatz's work on the collective dynamics of small-world networks and seven years after Barabasi &amp; Albert's discovery of scale-free networks, the area of dynamical processes on complex networks is at the forefront of the current research on nonlinear dynamics and complex systems. 
020       This volume brings together a selection of original contributions in complementary topics of statistical physics, nonlinear dynamics and biological sciences, and is expected to provide the reader with a comprehensive up-to-date representation of this rapidly developing area.

010       Self-similarity, small-world, scale-free scaling, disassortativity, and   robustness in hierarchical lattices
021       In this paper, firstly, we study analytically the topological features of a family of hierarchical lattices (HLs) from the view point of complex networks. 
020       We derive some basic properties of HLs controlled by a parameter $q$. Our results show that scale-free networks are not always small-world, and support the conjecture that self-similar scale-free networks are not assortative. Secondly, we define a deterministic family of graphs called small-world hierarchical lattices (SWHLs). Our construction preserves the structure of hierarchical lattices, while the small-world phenomenon arises. Finally, the dynamical processes of intentional attacks and collective synchronization are studied and the comparisons between HLs and Barab{\'asi}-Albert (BA) networks as well as SWHLs are shown. We show that degree distribution of scale-free networks does not suffice to characterize their synchronizability, and that networks with smaller average path length are not always easier to synchronize.

010       Network Structure Revealed by Short Cycles
021       This article explores the relationship between communities and short cycles in complex networks, based on the fact that nodes more densely connected amongst one another are more likely to be linked through short cycles. 
020       By identifying combinations of 3-, 4- and 5-edge-cycles, a subnetwork is obtained which contains only those nodes and links belonging to such cycles, which can then be used to highlight community structure. Examples are shown using a theoretical model (Sznajd networks) and a real-world network (NCAA football).

010       Characterization of complex networks by higher order neighborhood   properties
021       A concept of higher order neighborhood in complex networks, introduced previously (PRE \textbf{73}, 046101, (2006)), is systematically explored to investigate larger scale structures in complex networks. 
020       The basic idea is to consider each higher order neighborhood as a network in itself, represented by a corresponding adjacency matrix. Usual network indices are then used to evaluate the properties of each neighborhood. Results for a large number of typical networks are presented and discussed. Further, the information from all neighborhoods is condensed in a single neighborhood matrix, which can be explored for visualizing the neighborhood structure. On the basis of such representation, a distance is introduced to compare, in a quantitative way, how far apart networks are in the space of neighborhood matrices. The distance depends both on the network topology and the adopted node numbering. Given a pair of networks, a Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to find the best numbering for one of them, holding fixed the numbering of the second network, obtaining a projection of the first one onto the pattern of the other. The minimal value found for the distance reflects differences in the neighborhood structures of the two networks that arise from distinct topologies. Examples are worked out allowing for a quantitative comparison for distances among a set of distinct networks.

010       Network Information Flow in Small World Networks
021       Recent results from statistical physics show that large classes of complex networks, both man-made and of natural origin, are characterized by high clustering properties yet strikingly short path lengths between pairs of nodes. 
020       This class of networks are said to have a small-world topology. In the context of communication networks, navigable small-world topologies, i.e. those which admit efficient distributed routing algorithms, are deemed particularly effective, for example in resource discovery tasks and peer-to-peer applications. Breaking with the traditional approach to small-world topologies that privileges graph parameters pertaining to connectivity, and intrigued by the fundamental limits of communication in networks that exploit this type of topology, we investigate the capacity of these networks from the perspective of network information flow. Our contribution includes upper and lower bounds for the capacity of standard and navigable small-world models, and the somewhat surprising result that, with high probability, random rewiring does not alter the capacity of a small-world network.

010       Probabilistic Inductive Classes of Graphs
021       Models of complex networks are generally defined as graph stochastic processes in which edges and vertices are added or deleted over time to simulate the evolution of networks. 
020       Here, we define a unifying framework - probabilistic inductive classes of graphs - for formalizing and studying evolution of complex networks. Our definition of probabilistic inductive class of graphs (PICG) extends the standard notion of inductive class of graphs (ICG) by imposing a probability space. A PICG is given by: (1) class B of initial graphs, the basis of PICG, (2) class R of generating rules, each with distinguished left element to which the rule is applied to obtain the right element, (3) probability distribution specifying how the initial graph is chosen from class B, (4) probability distribution specifying how the rules from class R are applied, and, finally, (5) probability distribution specifying how the left elements for every rule in class R are chosen. We point out that many of the existing models of growing networks can be cast as PICGs. We present how the well known model of growing networks - the preferential attachment model - can be studied as PICG. As an illustration we present results regarding the size, order, and degree sequence for PICG models of connected and 2-connected graphs.

010       An information-theoretic framework for resolving community structure in   complex networks
021       To understand the structure of a large-scale biological, social, or technological network, it can be helpful to decompose the network into smaller subunits or modules. 
020       In this article, we develop an information-theoretic foundation for the concept of modularity in networks. We identify the modules of which the network is composed by finding an optimal compression of its topology, capitalizing on regularities in its structure. We explain the advantages of this approach and illustrate them by partitioning a number of real-world and model networks.

010       Topological fractal networks introduced by mixed degree distribution
021       Several fundamental properties of real complex networks, such as the small-world effect, the scale-free degree distribution, and recently discovered topological fractal structure, have presented the possibility of a unique growth mechanism and allow for uncovering universal origins of collective behaviors. 
020       However, highly clustered scale-free network, with power-law degree distribution, or small-world network models, with exponential degree distribution, are not self-similarity. We investigate networks growth mechanism of the branching-deactivated geographical attachment preference that learned from certain empirical evidence of social behaviors. It yields high clustering and spectrums of degree distribution ranging from algebraic to exponential, average shortest path length ranging from linear to logarithmic. We observe that the present networks fit well with small-world graphs and scale-free networks in both limit cases (exponential and algebraic degree distribution respectively), obviously lacking self-similar property under a length-scale transformation. Interestingly, we find perfect topological fractal structure emerges by a mixture of both algebraic and exponential degree distributions in a wide range of parameter values. The results present a reliable connection among small-world graphs, scale-free networks and topological fractal networks, and promise a natural way to investigate universal origins of collective behaviors.

010       Dynamical evolution of clustering in complex network of earthquakes
021       The network approach plays a distinguished role in contemporary science of complex systems/phenomena. 
020       Such an approach has been introduced into seismology in a recent work [S. Abe and N. Suzuki, Europhys. Lett. 65, 581 (2004)]. Here, we discuss the dynamical property of the earthquake network constructed in California and report the discovery that the values of the clustering coefficient remain stationary before main shocks, suddenly jump up at the main shocks, and then slowly decay following a power law to become stationary again. Thus, the network approach is found to characterize main shocks in a peculiar manner.

010       Effective networks for real-time distributed processing
021       The problem of real-time processing is one of the most challenging current issues in computer sciences. 
020       Because of the large amount of data to be treated in a limited period of time, parallel and distributed systems are required, whose performance depends on a series of factors including the interconnectivity of the processing elements, the application model and the communication protocol. Given their flexibility for representing and modeling natural and human-made systems (such as the Internet and WWW), complex networks have become a primary choice in many research areas. The current work presents how the concepts and methods of complex networks can be used to develop realistic models and simulations of distributed real-time system while taking into account two representative interconnection models: uniformly random and scale free (Barabasi-Albert), including the presence of background traffic of messages. The interesting obtained results include the identification of the uniformly random interconnectivity scheme as being largely more efficient than the scale-free counterpart.

020       Using nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor spacing distributions we analyze the eigenvalues of adjacency matrix of various model networks, namely, random, scale-free and small-world networks. These distributions follow Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistic of RMT. To probe long-range correlations in the eigenvalues we study spectral rigidity via $\Delta_3$ statistic of RMT as well. It follows RMT prediction of linear behavior in semi-logarithmic scale with slope being $\sim 1/\pi^2$. Random and scale-free networks follow RMT prediction for very large scale. Small-world network follows it for sufficiently large scale, but much less than the random and scale-free networks.

010       Transport optimization on complex networks
021       We present a comparative study of the application of a recently introduced heuristic algorithm to the optimization of transport on three major types of complex networks. 
020       The algorithm balances network traffic iteratively by minimizing the maximum node betweenness with as little path lengthening as possible. We show that by using this optimal routing, a network can sustain significantly higher traffic without jamming than in the case of shortest path routing. A formula is proved that allows quick computation of the average number of hops along the path and of the average travel times once the betweennesses of the nodes are computed. Using this formula, we show that routing optimization preserves the small-world character exhibited by networks under shortest path routing, and that it significantly reduces the average travel time on congested networks with only a negligible increase in the average travel time at low loads. Finally, we study the correlation between the weights of the links in the case of optimal routing and the betweennesses of the nodes connected by them.

010       How to calculate the fractal dimension of a complex network: the box   covering algorithm
021       Covering a network with the minimum possible number of boxes can reveal interesting features for the network structure, especially in terms of self-similar or fractal characteristics. 
020       Considerable attention has been recently devoted to this problem, with the finding that many real networks are self-similar fractals. Here we present, compare and study in detail a number of algorithms that we have used in previous papers towards this goal. We show that this problem can be mapped to the well-known graph coloring problem and then we simply can apply well-established algorithms. This seems to be the most efficient method, but we also present two other algorithms based on burning which provide a number of other benefits. We argue that the presented algorithms provide a solution close to optimal and that another algorithm that can significantly improve this result in an efficient way does not exist. We offer to anyone that finds such a method to cover his/her expenses for a 1-week trip to our lab in New York (details in <a href="http://jamlab.org">this http URL</a>).

010       Griffiths singularities and algebraic order in the exact solution of an   Ising model on a fractal modular network
021       We use an exact renormalization-group transformation to study the Ising model on a complex network composed of tightly-knit communities nested hierarchically with the fractal scaling recently discovered in a variety of real-world networks. 
020       Varying the ratio K/J of of inter- to intra-community coupling, we obtain an unusual phase diagram: at high temperatures or small K/J we have a disordered phase with a Griffiths singularity in the free energy, due to the presence of rare large clusters, which we analyze through the Yang-Lee zeros in the complex magnetic field plane. As the temperature is lowered, true long-range order is not seen, but there is a transition to algebraic order, where pair correlations have power-law decay with distance, reminiscent of the XY model. The transition is infinite-order at small K/J, and becomes second-order above a threshold value (K/J)_m. The existence of such slowly decaying correlations is unexpected in a fat-tailed scale-free network, where correlations longer than nearest-neighbor are typically suppressed.

021       We present our recent work on stochastic particle systems on complex networks. 
020       As a noninteracting system we first consider the diffusive motion of a random walker on heterogeneous complex networks. We find that the random walker is attracted toward nodes with larger degree and that the random walk motion is asymmetric. The asymmetry can be quantified with the random walk centrality, the matrix formulation of which is presented. As an interacting system, we consider the zero-range process on complex networks. We find that a structural heterogeneity can lead to a condensation phenomenon. These studies show that structural heterogeneity plays an important role in understanding the properties of dynamical systems.

020       The present work addresses a particularly important related aspect, namely the quantification of how well separated can the attractors be in dynamic systems underlined by four types of complex networks (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and as well as a geographic model). Attention is focused on grandmother dynamic systems, where each state variable (associated to each node) is used to represent a specific prototype pattern (attractor). By assuming that the attractors spread their influence among its neighboring nodes through a diffusive process, it is possible to overlook the specific details of specific dynamics and focus attention on the separability among such attractors. This property is defined in terms of two separation indices (one individual to each prototype and the other considering also the immediate neighborhood) reflecting the balance and proximity to attractors revealed by the activation of the network after a diffusive process. The separation index considering also the neighborhood was found to be much more informative, while the best separability was observed for the Watts-Strogatz and the geographic models. The effects of the involved parameters on the separability were investigated by correlation and path analyses. The obtained results suggest the special importance of some measurements in underlying the relationship between topology and dynamics.

010       Classes of complex networks defined by role-to-role connectivity   profiles
021       Interactions between units in phyical, biological, technological, and social systems usually give rise to intrincate networks with non-trivial structure, which critically affects the dynamics and properties of the system. 
020       The focus of most current research on complex networks is on global network properties. A caveat of this approach is that the relevance of global properties hinges on the premise that networks are homogeneous, whereas most real-world networks have a markedly modular structure. Here, we report that networks with different functions, including the Internet, metabolic, air transportation, and protein interaction networks, have distinct patterns of connections among nodes with different roles, and that, as a consequence, complex networks can be classified into two distinct functional classes based on their link type frequency. Importantly, we demonstrate that the above structural features cannot be captured by means of often studied global properties.

010       Module identification in bipartite and directed networks
021       Modularity is one of the most prominent properties of real-world complex networks. 
020       Here, we address the issue of module identification in two important classes of networks: bipartite networks and directed unipartite networks. Nodes in bipartite networks are divided into two non-overlapping sets, and the links must have one end node from each set. Directed unipartite networks only have one type of nodes, but links have an origin and an end. We show that directed unipartite networks can be conviniently represented as bipartite networks for module identification purposes. We report a novel approach especially suited for module detection in bipartite networks, and define a set of random networks that enable us to validate the new approach.

010       Structurally dynamic spin market networks
021       The agent-based model of stock price dynamics on a directed evolving complex network is suggested and studied by direct simulation. 
020       The stationary regime is maintained as a result of the balance between the extremal dynamics, adaptivity of strategic variables and reconnection rules. The inherent structure of node agent "brain" is modeled by a recursive neural network with local and global inputs and feedback connections. For specific parametric combination the complex network displays small-world phenomenon combined with scale-free behavior. The identification of a local leader (network hub, agent whose strategies are frequently adapted by its neighbors) is carried out by repeated random walk process through network. The simulations show empirically relevant dynamics of price returns and volatility clustering. The additional emerging aspects of stylized market statistics are Zipfian distributions of fitness.

010       Different topologies for a herding model of opinion
021       Understanding how opinions spread through a community or how consensus emerges in noisy environments can have a significant impact on our comprehension of social relations among individuals. 
020       In this work a model for the dynamics of opinion formation is introduced. The model is based on a nonlinear interaction between opinion vectors of agents plus a stochastic variable to account for the effect of noise in the way the agents communicate. The dynamics presented is able to generate rich dynamical patterns of interacting groups or clusters of agents with the same opinion without a leader or centralized control. Our results show that by increasing the intensity of noise, the system goes from consensus to a disordered state. Depending on the number of competing opinions and the details of the network of interactions, the system displays a first- or a second-order transition. We compare the behavior of different topologies of interactions: one-dimensional chains, and annealed and complex networks.

010       The rich-club phenomenon across complex network hierarchies
021       The so-called rich-club phenomenon in a complex network is characterized when nodes of higher degree (hubs) are better connected among themselves than are nodes with smaller degree. 
020       The presence of the rich-club phenomenon may be an indicator of several interesting high-level network properties, such as tolerance to hub failures. Here we investigate the existence of the rich-club phenomenon across the hierarchical degrees of a number of real-world networks. Our simulations reveal that the phenomenon may appear in some hierarchies but not in others and, moreover, that it may appear and disappear as we move across hierarchies. This reveals the interesting possibility of non-monotonic behavior of the phenomenon; the possible implications of our findings are discussed.

010       Co-evolution of strategy and structure in complex networks with   dynamical linking
021       Here we introduce a model in which individuals differ in the rate at which they seek new interactions with others, making rational decisions modeled as general symmetric two-player games. 
020       Once a link between two individuals has formed, the productivity of this link is evaluated. Links can be broken off at different rates. We provide analytic results for the limiting cases where linking dynamics is much faster than evolutionary dynamics and vice-versa, and show how the individual capacity of forming new links or severing inconvenient ones maps into the problem of strategy evolution in a well-mixed population under a different game. For intermediate ranges, we investigate numerically the detailed interplay determined by these two time-scales and show that the scope of validity of the analytical results extends to a much wider ratio of time scales than expected.

010       Synchronizability determined by coupling strengths and topology on   Complex Networks
021       We investigate in depth the synchronization of coupled oscillators on top of complex networks with different degrees of heterogeneity within the context of the Kuramoto model. 
020       In a previous paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 034101 (2007)], we unveiled how for fixed coupling strengths local patterns of synchronization emerge differently in homogeneous and heterogeneous complex networks. Here, we provide more evidence on this phenomenon extending the previous work to networks that interpolate between homogeneous and heterogeneous topologies. We also present new details on the path towards synchronization for the evolution of clustering in the synchronized patterns. Finally, we investigate the synchronization of networks with modular structure and conclude that, in these cases, local synchronization is first attained at the most internal level of organization of modules, progressively evolving to the outer levels as the coupling constant is increased. The present work introduces new parameters that are proved to be useful for the characterization of synchronization phenomena in complex networks.

010       Scaling theory of transport in complex networks
021       Transport is an important function in many network systems and understanding its behavior on biological, social, and technological networks is crucial for a wide range of applications. 
020       However, it is a property that is not well-understood in these systems and this is probably due to the lack of a general theoretical framework. Here, based on the finding that renormalization can be applied to bio-networks, we develop a scaling theory of transport in self-similar networks. We demonstrate the networks invariance under length scale renormalization and we show that the problem of transport can be characterized in terms of a set of critical exponents. The scaling theory allows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport. We also generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for the dependence of transport on microscopic features, such as the degree of the nodes and the distance between them. Using transport concepts such as diffusion and resistance we exploit this invariance and we are able to explain, based on the topology of the network, recent experimental results on the broad flow distribution in metabolic networks.

010       Graph Partitioning Induced Phase Transitions
021       We study the percolation properties of graph partitioning on random regular graphs with N vertices of degree $k$. 
020       Optimal graph partitioning is directly related to optimal attack and immunization of complex networks. We find that for any partitioning process (even if non-optimal) that partitions the graph into equal sized connected components (clusters), the system undergoes a percolation phase transition at $f=f_c=1-2/k$ where $f$ is the fraction of edges removed to partition the graph. For optimal partitioning, at the percolation threshold, we find $S \sim N^{0.4}$ where $S$ is the size of the clusters and $\ell\sim N^{0.25}$ where $\ell$ is their diameter. Additionally, we find that $S$ undergoes multiple non-percolation transitions for $f&lt;f_c$.

010       Effect of initial conditions on Glauber dynamics in complex networks
021       The effect of initial spin configurations on zero-temperature Glauber spin dynamics in complex networks is investigated. 
020       In a system in which the initial spins are defined by centrality measures at the vertices of a network, a variety of non-trivial diffusive behaviors arise, particularly in relation to functional relationships between the initial and final fractions of positive spins, some of which exhibit a critical point. Notably, the majority spin in the initial state is not always dominant in the final state, and the phenomena that occur as a result of the dynamics differ according on the initial condition, even for the same network. It is thus concluded that the initial condition of a complex network exerts an influence on spin dynamics that is equally as strong as that exerted by the network structure.

010       Limited path percolation in complex networks
021       We study the stability of network communication after removal of $q=1-p$ links under the assumption that communication is effective only if the shortest path between nodes $i$ and $j$ after removal is shorter than $a\ell_{ij} (a\geq1)$ where $\ell_{ij}$ is the shortest path before removal. 
020       For a large class of networks, we find a new percolation transition at $\tilde{p}_c=(\kappa_o-1)^{(1-a)/a}$, where $\kappa_o\equiv &lt; k^2&gt;/&lt; k&gt;$ and $k$ is the node degree. Below $\tilde{p}_c$, only a fraction $N^{\delta}$ of the network nodes can communicate, where $\delta\equiv a(1-|\log p|/\log{(\kappa_o-1)}) &lt; 1$, while above $\tilde{p}_c$, order $N$ nodes can communicate within the limited path length $a\ell_{ij}$. Our analytical results are supported by simulations on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and scale-free network models. We expect our results to influence the design of networks, routing algorithms, and immunization strategies, where short paths are most relevant.

021       In this expository and resources chapter we review selected aspects of the mathematics of dynamical systems, stability, and chaos, within a historical framework that draws together two threads of its early development: celestial mechanics and control theory, and focussing on qualitative theory. 
020       From this perspective we show how concepts of stability enable us to classify dynamical equations and their solutions and connect the key issues of nonlinearity, bifurcation, control, and uncertainty that are common to time-dependent problems in natural and engineered systems. We discuss stability and bifurcations in three simple model problems, and conclude with a survey of recent extensions of stability theory to complex networks.

010       Size reduction of complex networks preserving modularity
021       The ubiquity of modular structure in real-world complex networks is being the focus of attention in many trials to understand the interplay between network topology and functionality. 
020       The best approaches to the identification of modular structure are based on the optimization of a quality function known as modularity. However this optimization is a hard task provided that the computational complexity of the problem is in the NP-hard class. Here we propose an exact method for reducing the size of weighted (directed and undirected) complex networks while maintaining invariant its modularity. This size reduction allows the heuristic algorithms that optimize modularity for a better exploration of the modularity landscape. We compare the modularity obtained in several real complex-networks by using the Extremal Optimization algorithm, before and after the size reduction, showing the improvement obtained. We speculate that the proposed analytical size reduction could be extended to an exact coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space renormalization.

010       Rediscovering the Co-occurrence Principles of Vowel Inventories: A   Complex Network Approach
021       In this work, we attempt to capture patterns of co-occurrence across vowel systems and at the same time figure out the nature of the force leading to the emergence of such patterns. 
020       For this purpose we define a weighted network where the vowels are the nodes and an edge between two nodes (read vowels) signify their co-occurrence likelihood over the vowel inventories. Through this network we identify communities of vowels, which essentially reflect their patterns of co-occurrence across languages. We observe that in the assortative vowel communities the constituent nodes (read vowels) are largely uncorrelated in terms of their features and show that they are formed based on the principle of maximal perceptual contrast. However, in the rest of the communities, strong correlations are reflected among the constituent vowels with respect to their features indicating that it is the principle of feature economy that binds them together. We validate the above observations by proposing a quantitative measure of perceptual contrast as well as feature economy and subsequently comparing the results obtained due to these quantifications with those where we assume that the vowel inventories had evolved just by chance.

010       How does degree heterogeneity affect an order-disorder transition?
021       We focus on the role played by the node degree distribution on the way collective phenomena emerge on complex networks. 
020       To address this question, we focus analytically on a typical model for cooperative behaviour, the Majority Rule, applied to dichotomous networks. The latter are composed of two kinds of nodes, each kind $i$ being characterized by a degree $k_i$. Dichotomous networks are therefore a simple instance of heterogeneous networks, especially adapted in order to reveal the effect of degree heterogeneity. Our main result are that degree heterogeneity affects the location of the order-disorder transition and that the system exhibits non-equipartition of the average opinion between the two kinds of nodes. This effect is observed in the ordered phase and in the disordered phase.

010       Structural constraints in complex networks
021       We present a link rewiring mechanism to produce surrogates of a network where both the degree distribution and the rich--club connectivity are preserved. 
020       We consider three real networks, the AS--Internet, the protein interaction and the scientific collaboration. We show that for a given degree distribution, the rich--club connectivity is sensitive to the degree--degree correlation, and on the other hand the degree--degree correlation is constrained by the rich--club connectivity. In particular, in the case of the Internet, the assortative coefficient is always negative and a minor change in its value can reverse the network's rich--club structure completely; while fixing the degree distribution and the rich--club connectivity restricts the assortative coefficient to such a narrow range, that a reasonable model of the Internet can be produced by considering mainly the degree distribution and the rich--club connectivity. We also comment on the suitability of using the maximal random network as a null model to assess the rich--club connectivity in real networks.

010       Seeking for Simplicity in Complex Networks
021       Complex networks can be understood as graphs whose connectivity deviates from those of regular or near-regular graphs, which are understood as being `simple'. 
020       While a great deal of the attention so far dedicated to complex networks has been duly driven by the `complex' nature of these structures, in this work we address the identification of simplicity, in the sense of regularity, in complex networks. The basic idea is to seek for subgraphs exhibiting small dispersion (e.g. standard deviation or entropy) of local measurements such as the node degree and clustering coefficient. This approach paves the way for the identification of subgraphs (patches) with nearly uniform connectivity, therefore complementing the characterization of the complexity of networks. We also performed analysis of cascade failures, revealing that the removal of vertices in `simple' regions results in smaller damage to the network structure than the removal of vertices in the heterogeneous regions. We illustrate the potential of the proposed methodology with respect to four theoretical models as well as protein-protein interaction networks of three different species. Our results suggest that the simplicity of protein interaction grows as the result of natural selection. This increase in simplicity makes these networks more robust to cascade failures.

010       Failure in Complex Social Networks
021       Tolerance against failures and errors is an important feature of many complex networked systems [1,2]. 
020       It has been shown that a class of inhomogeneously wired networks called scale-free[1,3] networks can be surprisingly robust to failures, suggesting that socially self-organized systems such as the World-Wide Web, the Internet, and other kinds of social networks [4] may have significant tolerance against failures by virtue of their scale-free degree distribution. I show that this finding only holds on the assumption that the diffusion process supported by the network is a simple one, requiring only a single contact in order for transmission to be successful.

010       Structure of n-clique networks embedded in a complex network
021       We propose the n-clique network as a powerful tool for understanding global structures of combined highly-interconnected subgraphs, and provide theoretical predictions for statistical properties of the n-clique networks embedded in a complex network using the degree distribution and the clustering spectrum. 
020       Furthermore, using our theoretical predictions, we find that the statistical properties are invariant between 3-clique networks and original networks for several observable real-world networks with the scale-free connectivity and the hierarchical modularity. The result implies that structural properties are identical between the 3-clique networks and the original networks.

021       The spectral densities of the weighted Laplacian, random walk and weighted adjacency matrices associated with a random complex network are studied using the replica method. 
020       The link weights are parametrized by a weight exponent $\beta$. Explicit results are obtained for scale-free networks in the limit of large mean degree after the thermodynamic limit, for arbitrary degree exponent and $\beta$.

010       A statistical mechanics approach for scale-free networks and   finite-scale networks
021       We present a statistical mechanics approach for the description of complex networks. 
020       We first define an energy and an entropy associated to a degree distribution which have a geometrical interpretation. Next we evaluate the distribution which extremize the free energy of the network. We find two important limiting cases: a scale-free degree distribution and a finite-scale degree distribution. The size of the space of allowed simple networks given these distribution is evaluated in the large network limit. Results are compared with simulations of algorithms generating these networks.

010       Synchronization reveals correlation between oscillators on networks
021       The understanding of synchronization ranging from natural to social systems has driven the interests of scientists from different disciplines. 
020       Here, we have investigated the synchronization dynamics of the Kuramoto dynamics departing from the fully synchronized regime. We have got the analytic expression of the dynamical correlation between pairs of oscillators that reveals the relation between the network dynamics and the underlying topology. Moreover, it also reveals the internal structure of networks that can be used as a new algorithm to detect community structures. Further, we have proposed a new measure about the synchronization in complex networks and scrutinize it in small-world and scale-free networks. Our results indicate that the more heterogeneous and "smaller" the network is, the more closely it would be synchronized by the collective dynamics.

010       Modular networks emerge from multiconstraint optimization
021       Modular structure is ubiquitous among complex networks. 
020       We note that most such systems are subject to multiple structural and functional constraints, e.g., minimizing the average path length and the total number of links, while maximizing robustness against perturbations in node activity. We show that the optimal networks satisfying these three constraints are characterized by the existence of multiple subnetworks (modules) sparsely connected to each other. In addition, these modules have distinct hubs, resulting in an overall heterogeneous degree distribution.

020       Numerical simulations show that our method generates only 2% of traffic compared with the most popular flooding-based query-packet-forwarding (FB) algorithm.

We also discuss the possible relationship between $&lt;T&gt;$ and $&lt;k^2&gt;$, the second moment of the degree distribution of the networks.

010       Fluctuation scaling versus gap scaling
021       Fluctuation scaling is observed phenomenon from complex networks through finance to ecology. 
020       It means that the variance and the mean of a specific quantity are related as $\ev{\sigma^2|n}\propto \ev{n|A}^{2\alpha}$ with $1/2\geq \alpha \geq 1$ when a parameter $A$ (usually the system size) is varied. $A$ can be the strength of the node, the capitalization of the firm or the area of the habitat. On the other hand, quantities often obey gap scaling meaning that their density function depends on, say, the system size $A$ as $P(n|A) = n^{-1}F(n/A^{\Phi})$. This note describes that these two notions cannot coexist except when $\alpha = 1$. In this way one can empirically exclude the possibility of gap scaling in many complex systems including population dynamics, stock market fluctuations and Internet router traffic, where $\alpha &lt; 1$.

010       Network Topology of the Austrian Airline Flights
021       The information of the Austrian airline flights was collected and quantitatively analyzed by the concepts of complex network. 
020       It displays some features of small-world networks, namely large clustering coefficient and small average shortest-path length. The degree distributions of the networks reveal power law behavior with exponent value of 2 $\sim$ 3 for the small degree branch but a flat tail for the large degree branch. Similarly, the flight weight distributions show power-law behavior for the small weight branch. Furthermore, we found that the clustering coefficient $C$, 0.206, of this flight network is greatly larger than that of a random network, 0.01, which has the same numbers of the airports ($N$) and mean degree ($&lt;k&gt;$), and the diameter $D$, 2.383, of the flight network is significantly smaller than the value of the same random network, 18.67. In addition, the degree-degree correlation analysis shows the network has disassortative behavior, i.e. the large airports are likely to link to smaller airports. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient analysis indicates that the large airports reveal the hierarchical organization.

021       The difficulties involved in spelling error detection and correction in a language have been investigated in this work through the conceptualization of SpellNet - the weighted network of words, where edges indicate orthographic proximity between two words. 
020       We construct SpellNets for three languages - Bengali, English and Hindi. Through appropriate mathematical analysis and/or intuitive justification, we interpret the different topological metrics of SpellNet from the perspective of the issues related to spell-checking. We make many interesting observations, the most significant among them being that the probability of making a real word error in a language is propotionate to the average weighted degree of SpellNet, which is found to be highest for Hindi, followed by Bengali and English.

010       Analysis of the structure of complex networks at different resolution   levels
021       Modular structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks, and its detection is important because it gives insights in the structure-functionality Modular structure is ubiquitous in real-world complex networks, and its detection is important because it gives insights in the structure-functionality relationship. 
020       The standard approach is based on the optimization of a quality function, modularity, which is a relative quality measure for a partition of a network into modules. Recently some authors [1,2] have pointed out that the optimization of modularity has a fundamental drawback: the existence of a resolution limit beyond which no modular structure can be detected even though these modules might have own entity. The reason is that several topological descriptions of the network coexist at different scales, which is, in general, a fingerprint of complex systems. Here we propose a method that allows for multiple resolution screening of the modular structure. The method has been validated using synthetic networks, discovering the predefined structures at all scales. Its application to two real social networks allows to find the exact splits reported in the literature, as well as the substructure beyond the actual split.

010       Optimal transport on wireless networks
021       We present a study of the application of a variant of a recently introduced heuristic algorithm for the optimization of transport routes on complex networks to the problem of finding the optimal routes of communication between nodes on wireless networks. 
020       Our algorithm iteratively balances network traffic by minimizing the maximum node betweenness on the network. The variant we consider specifically accounts for the broadcast restrictions imposed by wireless communication by using a different betweenness measure. We compare the performance of our algorithm to two other known algorithms and find that our algorithm achieves the highest transport capacity both for minimum node degree geometric networks, which are directed geometric networks that model wireless communication networks, and for configuration model networks that are uncorrelated scale-free networks.

010       The functional structure of cortical neuronal networks grown in vitro
021       We apply an information theoretic treatment of action potential time series measured with microelectrode arrays to estimate the connectivity of mammalian neuronal cell assemblies grown {\it in vitro}. 
020       We infer connectivity between two neurons via the measurement of the mutual information between their spike trains. In addition we measure higher point multi-informations between any two spike trains conditional on the activity of a third cell, as a means to identify and distinguish classes of functional connectivity among three neurons. The use of a conditional three-cell measure removes some interpretational shortcomings of the pairwise mutual information and sheds light into the functional connectivity arrangements of any three cells. We analyze the resultant connectivity graphs in light of other complex networks and demonstrate that, despite their {\it ex vivo} development, the connectivity maps derived from cultured neural assemblies are similar to other biological networks and display nontrivial structure in clustering coefficient, network diameter and assortative mixing. Specifically we show that these networks are weakly disassortative small world graphs, which differ significantly in their structure from randomized graphs with the same degree. We expect our analysis to be useful in identifying the computational motifs of a wide variety of complex networks, derived from time series data.

010       Robustness of Cooperation in the Evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma on   Complex Networks
021       Recent studies on the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game in scale-free networks have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the network interconnections enhances the evolutionary success of cooperation. 
020       In this paper we address the issue of how the characterization of the asymptotic states of the evolutionary dynamics depends on the initial concentration of cooperators. We find that the measure and the connectedness properties of the set of nodes where cooperation reaches fixation is largely independent of initial conditions, in contrast with the behavior of both the set of nodes where defection is fixed, and the fluctuating nodes. We also check for the robustness of these results when varying the degree heterogeneity along a one-parametric family of networks interpolating between the class of Erdos-Renyi graphs and the Barabasi-Albert networks.

020       evolutionary trees, which are a type of networks. The terminal nodes of these trees represent species, which are made of individuals and populations among which gene flow occurs. This flow can also be represented as a network. In this paper we briefly show some properties of these complex networks of evolutionary and ecological relationships. First, we characterize large scale evolutionary relationships in the Tree of Life by a degree distribution. Second, we represent genetic relationships between individuals of a Mediterranean marine plant, Posidonia oceanica, in terms of a Minimum Spanning Tree. Finally, relationships among plant shoots inside populations are represented as networks of genetic similarity.

010       Simulation of Robustness against Lesions of Cortical Networks
021       Structure entails function and thus a structural description of the brain will help to understand its function and may provide insights into many properties of brain systems, from their robustness and recovery from damage, to their dynamics and even their evolution. 
020       Advances in the analysis of complex networks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and functional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks recently described allow their characterization as small-world, random (exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that have been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology, hodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network analysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and macaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark rewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis strategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free networks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks' connectivity.

010       Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks
021       Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are investigated. 
020       Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted, and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the unsynchronizable state.

We introduce structural correlations and strongly reduce congestion occurring on the network by using a Monte Carlo optimization scheme. This optimization alters the degree distribution and other structural properties of the resulting gradient networks. These results are expected to be relevant for transport and other dynamical processes in real network systems.

010       Effects of accelerating growth on the evolution of weighted complex   networks
021       Many real systems possess accelerating statistics where the total number of edges grows faster than the network size. 
020       In this paper, we propose a simple weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and weight, which are relevant to accelerating growth. We also find that accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks. Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect to accelerating growth increases from a small to large value. All the theoretical predictions are successfully contrasted with extensive numerical simulations.

This derivation allows to understand the universal CSN network topology observed in systems ranging from a simple quadratic well to the native state of the beta3s peptide and a 2D lattice heteropolymer. Moreover CSN are shown to fall in the general class of complex networks describe d by the fitness model.

021       The science of complex networks is a new interdisciplinary branch of science which has arisen recently on the interface of physics, biology, social and computer sciences, and others. 
020       Its main goal is to discover general laws governing the creation and growth as well as processes taking place on networks, like e.g. the Internet, transportation or neural networks. It turned out that most real-world networks cannot be simply reduced to a compound of some individual components. Fortunately, the statistical mechanics, being one of pillars of modern physics, provides us with a very powerful set of tools and methods for describing and understanding these systems. In this thesis, we would like to present a consistent approach to complex networks based on statistical mechanics, with the central role played by the concept of statistical ensemble of networks. We show how to construct such a theory and present some practical problems where it can be applied. Among them, we pay attention to the problem of finite-size corrections and the dynamics of a simple model of mass transport on networks.

010       Identifying network communities with a high resolution
021       Community structure is an important property of complex networks. 
020       An automatic discovery of such structure is a fundamental task in many disciplines, including sociology, biology, engineering, and computer science. Recently, several community discovery algorithms have been proposed based on the optimization of a quantity called modularity (Q). However, the problem of modularity optimization is NP-hard, and the existing approaches often suffer from prohibitively long running time or poor quality. Furthermore, it has been recently pointed out that algorithms based on optimizing Q will have a resolution limit, i.e., communities below a certain scale may not be detected. In this research, we first propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, Qcut, which combines spectral graph partitioning and local search to optimize Q. Using both synthetic and real networks, we show that Qcut can find higher modularities and is more scalable than the existing algorithms. Furthermore, using Qcut as an essential component, we propose a recursive algorithm, HQcut, to solve the resolution limit problem. We show that HQcut can successfully detect communities at a much finer scale and with a higher accuracy than the existing algorithms. Finally, we apply Qcut and HQcut to study a protein-protein interaction network, and show that the combination of the two algorithms can reveal interesting biological results that may be otherwise undetectable.

010       Critical phenomena in complex networks
021       The combination of the compactness of networks, featuring small diameters, and their complex architectures results in a variety of critical effects dramatically different from those in cooperative systems on lattices. 
020       In the last few years, researchers have made important steps toward understanding the qualitatively new critical phenomena in complex networks. We review the results, concepts, and methods of this rapidly developing field. Here we mostly consider two closely related classes of these critical phenomena, namely structural phase transitions in the network architectures and transitions in cooperative models on networks as substrates. We also discuss systems where a network and interacting agents on it influence each other. We overview a wide range of critical phenomena in equilibrium and growing networks including the birth of the giant connected component, percolation, k-core percolation, phenomena near epidemic thresholds, condensation transitions, critical phenomena in spin models placed on networks, synchronization, and self-organized criticality effects in interacting systems on networks. We also discuss strong finite size effects in these systems and highlight open problems and perspectives.

010       A discrete computer network model with expanding dimensions
021       Complex networks with expanding dimensions are studied, where the networks may be directed and weighted, and network nodes are varying in discrete time in the sense that some new nodes may be added and some old nodes may be removed from time to time. 
020       A model of such networks in computer data transmission is discussed. Each node on the network has fixed dimensionality, while the dimension of the whole network is defined by the total number of nodes. Based on the spectacular properties of data transmission on computer networks, some new concepts of stable and unstable networks differing from the classical Lyapunov stability are defined. In particular, a special unstable network model, called devil network, is introduced and discussed. It is further found that a variety of structures and connection weights affects the network stability substantially. Several criteria on stability, instability, and devil network are established for a rather general class of networks, where some conditions are actually necessary and sufficient. Mathematically, this paper makes a first attempt to rigorously formulate a fundamental issue of modeling discrete linear time-varying systems with expanding dimensions and study their basic stability property.

010       Mykyta the Fox and networks of language
021       The results of quantitative analysis of word distribution in two fables in Ukrainian by Ivan Franko: "Mykyta the Fox" and "Abu-Kasym's slippers" are reported. 
020       Our study consists of two parts: the analysis of frequency-rank distributions and the application of complex networks theory. The analysis of frequency-rank distributions shows that the text sizes are enough to observe statistical properties. The power-law character of these distributions (Zipf's law) holds in the region of rank variable r=20 - 3000 with an exponent $\alpha\simeq 1$. This substantiates the choice of the above texts to analyse typical properties of the language complex network on their basis. Besides, an applicability of the Simon model to describe non-asymptotic properties of word distributions is evaluated. <br />In describing language as a complex network, usually the words are associated with nodes, whereas one may give different meanings to the network links. This results in different network representations. In the second part of the paper, we give different representations of the language network and perform comparative analysis of their characteristics. Our results demonstrate that the language network of Ukrainian is a strongly correlated scale-free small world. Empirical data obtained may be useful for theoretical description of language evolution.

010       Statistical significance of rich-club phenomena in complex networks
021       We propose that the rich-club phenomena in complex networks should be defined in the spirit of bootstrapping, in which a null model is adopted to assess the statistical significance of the rich-club detected. 
020       Our method can be served as a definition of rich-club phenomenon and is applied to analyzing three real networks and three model networks. The results improve significantly compared with previously reported results. We report a dilemma with an exceptional example, showing that there does not exist an omnipotent definition for the rich-club phenomenon.

010       Dynamical and spectral properties of complex networks
021       Dynamical properties of complex networks are related to the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix that describes the pattern of connectivity of the network. 
020       In particular we compute the synchronization time for different types of networks and different dynamics. We show that the main dependence of the synchronization time is on the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, in contrast to other proposals in terms of the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. Then, this topological property becomes the most relevant for the dynamics.

010       What are the Best Hierarchical Descriptors for Complex Networks?
021       This work reviews several hierarchical measurements of the topology of complex networks and then applies feature selection concepts and methods in order to quantify the relative importance of each measurement with respect to the discrimination between four representative theoretical network models, namely Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz as well as a geographical type of network. 
020       The obtained results confirmed that the four models can be well-separated by using a combination of measurements. In addition, the relative contribution of each considered feature for the overall discrimination of the models was quantified in terms of the respective weights in the canonical projection into two dimensions, with the traditional clustering coefficient, hierarchical clustering coefficient and neighborhood clustering coefficient resulting particularly effective. Interestingly, the average shortest path length and hierarchical node degrees contributed little for the separation of the four network models.

010       Quality functions in community detection
021       Community structure represents the local organization of complex networks and the single most important feature to extract functional relationships between nodes. 
020       In the last years, the problem of community detection has been reformulated in terms of the optimization of a function, the Newman-Girvan modularity, that is supposed to express the quality of the partitions of a network into communities. Starting from a recent critical survey on modularity optimization, pointing out the existence of a resolution limit that poses severe limits to its applicability, we discuss the general issue of the use of quality functions in community detection. Our main conclusion is that quality functions are useful to compare partitions with the same number of modules, whereas the comparison of partitions with different numbers of modules is not straightforward and may lead to ambiguities.

010       Evolution of complex modular biological networks
021       Biological networks have evolved to be highly functional within uncertain environments while remaining extremely adaptable. 
020       One of the main contributors to the robustness and evolvability of biological networks is believed to be their modularity of function, with modules defined as sets of genes that are strongly interconnected but whose function is separable from those of other modules. Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and robustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing amount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous features of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free edge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance. These networks evolve in environments that differ in their predictability, and allow us to study modularity from topological, information-theoretic, and gene-epistatic points of view using new tools that do not depend on any preconceived notion of modularity. We find that for our evolved complex networks as well as for the yeast protein-protein interaction network, synthetic lethal pairs consist mostly of redundant genes that lie close to each other and therefore within modules, while knockdown suppressor pairs are farther apart and often straddle modules, suggesting that knockdown rescue is mediated by alternative pathways or modules. The combination of network modularity tools together with genetic interaction data constitutes a powerful approach to study and dissect the role of modularity in the evolution and function of biological networks.

010       Spectral coarse-graining of complex networks
021       Reducing the complexity of large systems described as complex networks is key to understand them and a crucial issue is to know which properties of the initial system are preserved in the reduced one. 
020       Here we use random walks to design a coarse-graining scheme for complex networks. By construction the coarse-graining preserves the slow modes of the walk, while reducing significantly the size and the complexity of the network. In this sense our coarse-graining allows to approximate large networks by smaller ones, keeping most of their relevant spectral properties.

010       Laplacian spectra of complex networks and random walks on them: Are   scale-free architectures really important?
021       We study the Laplacian operator of an uncorrelated random network and, as an application, consider hopping processes (diffusion, random walks, signal propagation, etc.) on networks. 
020       We develop a strict approach to these problems. We derive an exact closed set of integral equations, which provide the averages of the Laplacian operator's resolvent. This enables us to describe the propagation of a signal and random walks on the network. We show that the determining parameter in this problem is the minimum degree $q_m$ of vertices in the network and that the high-degree part of the degree distribution is not that essential. The position of the lower edge of the Laplacian spectrum $\lambda_c$ appears to be the same as in the regular Bethe lattice with the coordination number $q_m$. Namely, $\lambda_c&gt;0$ if $q_m&gt;2$, and $\lambda_c=0$ if $q_m\leq2$. In both these cases the density of eigenvalues $\rho(\lambda)\to0$ as $\lambda\to\lambda_c+0$, but the limiting behaviors near $\lambda_c$ are very different. In terms of a distance from a starting vertex, the hopping propagator is a steady moving Gaussian, broadening with time. This picture qualitatively coincides with that for a regular Bethe lattice. Our analytical results include the spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ near $\lambda_c$ and the long-time asymptotics of the autocorrelator and the propagator.

020       Using the well-known methods of non-equilibrium thermodynamics we identify thermodynamic forces and their conjugated flows induced in networks as a result of single node degree perturbation. The forces and the flows can be understood as a response of the system to events, such as random removal of nodes or intentional attacks on them. Finally, we show that cross effects (such as thermodiffusion, or thermoelectric phenomena), in which one force may not only give rise to its own corresponding flow, but to many other flows, can be observed also in complex networks.

010       Limited resolution and multiresolution methods in complex network   community detection
021       Detecting community structure in real-world networks is a challenging problem. 
020       Recently, it has been shown that the resolution of methods based on optimizing a modularity measure or a corresponding energy is limited; communities with sizes below some threshold remain unresolved. One possibility to go around this problem is to vary the threshold by using a tuning parameter, and investigate the community structure at variable resolutions. Here, we analyze the resolution limit and multiresolution behavior for two different methods: a q-state Potts method proposed by Reichard and Bornholdt, and a recent multiresolution method by Arenas, Fernandez, and Gomez. These methods are studied analytically, and applied to three test networks using simulated annealing.

010       Chain motifs: The tails and handles of complex networks
021       Great part of the interest in complex networks has been motivated by the presence of structured, frequently non-uniform, connectivity. 
020       Because diverse connectivity patterns tend to result in distinct network dynamics, and also because they provide the means to identify and classify several types of complex networks, it becomes important to obtain meaningful measurements of the local network topology. In addition to traditional features such as the node degree, clustering coefficient and shortest path, motifs have been introduced in the literature in order to provide complementary description of the networks connectivity. The current work proposes a new type of motifs, namely chains of nodes, namely sequences of connected nodes with degree two. These chains have been subdivided into cords, tails, rings and handles, depending on the type of their extremities (e.g. open or connected). A theoretical analysis of the density of such motifs in random and scale free networks is described, and an algorithm for identifying those motifs in general networks is presented. The potential of considering chains for network characterization has been illustrated with respect to five categories of real-world networks including 16 cases. Several interesting findings were obtained, including the fact that several chains were observed in the real-world networks, especially the WWW, books, and power-grid. The possibility of chains resulting from incompletely sampled networks is also investigated.

010       Seeking the best Internet Model
021       The models of the Internet reported in the literature are mainly aimed at reproducing the scale-free structure, the high clustering coefficient and the small world effects found in the real Internet, while other important properties (e.g. 
020       related to centrality and hierarchical measurements) are not considered. For a better characterization and modeling of such network, a larger number of topological properties must be considered. In this work, we present a sound multivariate statistical approach, including feature spaces and multivariate statistical analysis (especially canonical projections), in order to characterize several Internet models while considering a larger set of relevant measurements. We apply such a methodology to determine, among nine complex networks models, which are those most compatible with the real Internet data (on the autonomous systems level) considering a set of 21 network measurements. We conclude that none of the considered models can reproduce the Internet topology with high accuracy.

010       Border trees of complex networks
021       The comprehensive characterization of the structure of complex networks is essential to understand the dynamical processes which guide their evolution. 
020       The discovery of the scale-free distribution and the small world property of real networks were fundamental to stimulate more realistic models and to understand some dynamical processes such as network growth. However, properties related to the network borders (nodes with degree equal to one), one of its most fragile parts, remain little investigated and understood. The border nodes may be involved in the evolution of structures such as geographical networks. Here we analyze complex networks by looking for border trees, which are defined as the subgraphs without cycles connected to the remainder of the network (containing cycles) and terminating into border nodes. In addition to describing an algorithm for identification of such tree subgraphs, we also consider a series of their measurements, including their number of vertices, number of leaves, and depth. We investigate the properties of border trees for several theoretical models as well as real-world networks.

010       Percolation and Loop Statistics in Complex Networks
021       Complex networks display various types of percolation transitions. 
020       We show that the degree distribution and the degree-degree correlation alone are not sufficient to describe diverse percolation critical phenomena. This suggests that a genuine structural correlation is an essential ingredient in characterizing networks. As a signature of the correlation we investigate a scaling behavior in $M_N(h)$, the number of finite loops of size $h$, with respect to a network size $N$. We find that networks, whose degree distributions are not too broad, fall into two classes exhibiting $M_N(h)\sim ({constant})$ and $M_N(h) \sim (\ln N)^\psi$, respectively. This classification coincides with the one according to the percolation critical phenomena.

010       Maps of random walks on complex networks reveal community structure
021       To comprehend the multipartite organization of large-scale biological and social systems, we introduce a new information theoretic approach that reveals community structure in weighted and directed networks. 
020       The method decomposes a network into modules by optimally compressing a description of information flows on the network. The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of more than 6000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network -- including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine -- information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.

010       Communicability in complex networks
021       Many topological and dynamical properties of complex networks are defined by assuming that most of the transport on the network flows along the shortest paths. 
020       However, there are different scenarios in which non-shortest paths are used to reach the network destination. Thus the consideration of the shortest paths only does not account for the global communicability of a complex network. Here we propose a new measure of the communicability of a complex network, which is a broad generalization of the concept of the shortest path. According to the new measure, most of real-world networks display the largest communicability between the most connected (popular) nodes of the network (assortative communicability). There are also several networks with the disassortative communicability, where the most "popular" nodes communicate very poorly to each other. Using this information we classify a diverse set of real-world complex systems into a small number of universality classes based on their structure-dynamic correlation. In addition, the new communicability measure is able to distinguish finer structures of networks, such as communities into which a network is divided. A community is unambiguously defined here as a set of nodes displaying larger communicability among them than to the rest of nodes in the network.

010       Efficiency of navigation in indexed networks
021       We investigate efficient methods for packets to navigate in complex networks. 
020       The packets are assumed to have memory, but no previous knowledge of the graph. We assume the graph to be indexed, i.e. every vertex is associated with a number (accessible to the packets) between one and the size of the graph. We test different schemes to assign indices and utilize them in packet navigation. Four different network models with very different topological characteristics are used for testing the schemes. We find that one scheme outperform the others, and has an efficiency close to the theoretical optimum. We discuss the use of indexed-graph navigation in peer-to-peer networking and other distributed information systems.

010       Fuzzy communities and the concept of bridgeness in complex networks
021       We consider the problem of fuzzy community detection in networks, which complements and expands the concept of overlapping community structure. 
020       Our approach allows each vertex of the graph to belong to multiple communities at the same time, determined by exact numerical membership degrees, even in the presence of uncertainty in the data being analyzed. We created an algorithm for determining the optimal membership degrees with respect to a given goal function. Based on the membership degrees, we introduce a new measure that is able to identify outlier vertices that do not belong to any of the communities, bridge vertices that belong significantly to more than one single community, and regular vertices that fundamentally restrict their interactions within their own community, while also being able to quantify the centrality of a vertex with respect to its dominant community. The method can also be used for prediction in case of uncertainty in the dataset analyzed. The number of communities can be given in advance, or determined by the algorithm itself using a fuzzified variant of the modularity function. The technique is able to discover the fuzzy community structure of different real world networks including, but not limited to social networks, scientific collaboration networks and cortical networks with high confidence.

010       Pinning Complex Networks by a Single Controller
021       In this paper, without assuming symmetry, irreducibility, or linearity of the couplings, we prove that a single controller can pin a coupled complex network to a homogenous solution. 
020       Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the convergence of the pinning process locally and globally. An effective approach to adapt the coupling strength is proposed. Several numerical simulations are given to verify our theoretical analysis.

010       Discrete surface growth process as a synchronization mechanism for scale   free complex networks
021       We consider the discrete surface growth process with relaxation to the minimum [F. 
020       Family, J. Phys. A {\bf 19} L441, (1986).] as a possible synchronization mechanism on scale-free networks, characterized by a degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$, where $k$ is the degree of a node and $\lambda$ his broadness, and compare it with the usually applied Edward-Wilkinson process [S. F. Edwards and D. R. Wilkinson, Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. A {\bf 381},17 (1982) ]. In spite of both processes belong to the same universality class for Euclidean lattices, in this work we demonstrate that for scale-free networks with exponents $\lambda&lt;3$ this is not true. Moreover, we show that for these ubiquitous cases the Edward-Wilkinson process enhances spontaneously the synchronization when the system size is increased, which is a non-physical result. Contrarily, the discrete surface growth process do not present this flaw and is applicable for every $\lambda$.

010       The multiple effects of gradient coupling on network synchronization
021       Recent studies have shown that synchronizability of complex networks can be significantly improved by asymmetric couplings, and increase of coupling gradient is always in favor of network synchronization. 
020       Here we argue and demonstrate that, for typical complex networks, there usually exists an optimal coupling gradient under which the maximum network synchronizability is achieved. After this optimal value, increase of coupling gradient could deteriorate synchronization. We attribute the suppression of network synchronization at large gradient to the phenomenon of network breaking, and find that, in comparing with sparsely connected homogeneous networks, densely connected heterogeneous networks have the superiority of adopting large gradient. The findings are supported by indirect simulations of eigenvalue analysis and direct simulations of coupled nonidentical oscillator networks.

010       Complex Networks in and beyond Physics
021       Physicists study a wide variety of phenomena creating new interdisciplinary research fields by applying theories and methods originally developed in physics in order to solve problems in economics, social science, biology, medicine, technology, etc. 
020       In their turn, these different branches of science inspire the invention of new concepts in physics. A basic tool of analysis, in such a context, is the mathematical theory of complexity concerned with the study of complex systems including human economies, climate, nervous systems, cells and living things, including human beings, as well as modern energy or communication infrastructures which are all networks of some kind. Recently, complexity has become a natural domain of interest of the real world socio-cognitive systems, linguistics, and emerging systemics research. The phenomena to be studied and understood arise from neither the physical laws nor the abstraction of mathematics. The challenge is to discern and formulate plausible mathematical structures to describe problems that represent vague human goals.

020       They can be used as statistical null models for empirical networks, and as a tool for theoretical investigations. We provide general theorems that carachterize the degree distribution of the ensemble graphs, together with some features that are important for applications, such as subgraph distributions and kernel of the adjacency matrix. These results are used to compare to other models of simple and complex networks. A particular case of directed networks with power-law out--degree is studied in more detail, as an example of the flexibility of the model in applications.

010       Mutual information in random Boolean models of regulatory networks
021       The amount of mutual information contained in time series of two elements gives a measure of how well their activities are coordinated. 
020       In a large, complex network of interacting elements, such as a genetic regulatory network within a cell, the average of the mutual information over all pairs &lt;I&gt; is a global measure of how well the system can coordinate its internal dynamics. We study this average pairwise mutual information in random Boolean networks (RBNs) as a function of the distribution of Boolean rules implemented at each element, assuming that the links in the network are randomly placed. Efficient numerical methods for calculating &lt;I&gt; show that as the number of network nodes N approaches infinity, the quantity N&lt;I&gt; exhibits a discontinuity at parameter values corresponding to critical RBNs. For finite systems it peaks near the critical value, but slightly in the disordered regime for typical parameter variations. The source of high values of N&lt;I&gt; is the indirect correlations between pairs of elements from different long chains with a common starting point. The contribution from pairs that are directly linked approaches zero for critical networks and peaks deep in the disordered regime.

010       Towards journalometrical analysis of a scientific periodical: a case   study
021       In this paper we use several approaches to analyse a scientific journal as a complex system and to make a possibly more complete description of its current state and evolution. 
020       Methods of complex networks theory, statistics, and queueing theory are used in this study. As a subject of the analysis we have chosen the journal ``Condensed Matter Physics'' (<a href="http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/journal/">this http URL</a>). In particular, based on the statistical data regarding the papers published in this journal since its foundation in 1993 up to now we have composed the co-authorship network and extracted its main quantitative characteristics. Further, we analyse the priorities of scientific trends reflected in the journal and its impact on the publications in other editions (the citation ratings). Moreover, to characterize an efficiency of the paper processing, we study the time dynamics of editorial processing in terms of queueing theory and human activity analysis.

010       Multiple complex networks emerging from individual interactions
021       Systems composed of distinct complex networks are present in many real-world environments, from society to ecological systems. 
020       In the present paper, we propose a network model obtained as a consequence of interactions between two species (e.g. predator and prey). Fields are produced and sensed by the individuals, defining spatio-temporal patterns which are strongly affected by the attraction intensity between individuals from the same species. The dynamical evolution of the system, including the change of individuals between different clusters, is investigated by building two complex networks having the individuals as nodes. In the first network, the edge weight is given by the Euclidean distance between every two individuals and, in the case of the second network, by the amount of time two individuals stay close one another. A third network is obtained from the two previous networks whose nodes correspond to the spatially congruent groups. The system evolves to an organized state where Gaussian and scale-free-like strength distributions emerge, respectively, in the predator and prey networks. Such a different connectivity is mainly a consequence of preys elimination. Some configurations favor the survival of preys or higher efficiency of predator activity.

021       Topology and weights are closely related in weighted complex networks and this is reflected in their modular structure. 
020       We present a simple network model where the weights are generated dynamically and they shape the developing topology. By tuning a model parameter governing the importance of weights, the resulting networks undergo a gradual structural transition from a module free topology to one with communities. The model also reproduces many features of large social networks, including the "weak links" property.

010       Role models for complex networks
021       We present a framework for automatically decomposing ("block-modeling") the functional classes of agents within a complex network. 
020       These classes are represented by the nodes of an image graph ("block model") depicting the main patterns of connectivity and thus functional roles in the network. Using a first principles approach, we derive a measure for the fit of a network to any given image graph allowing objective hypothesis testing. From the properties of an optimal fit, we derive how to find the best fitting image graph directly from the network and present a criterion to avoid overfitting. The method can handle both two-mode and one-mode data, directed and undirected as well as weighted networks and allows for different types of links to be dealt with simultaneously. It is non-parametric and computationally efficient. The concepts of structural equivalence and modularity are found as special cases of our approach. We apply our method to the world trade network and analyze the roles individual countries play in the global economy.

010       Effects of the network structural properties on its controllability
021       In a recent paper, it has been suggested that the controllability of a diffusively coupled complex network, subject to localized feedback loops at some of its vertices, can be assessed by means of a Master Stability Function approach, where the network controllability is defined in terms of the spectral properties of an appropriate Laplacian matrix. 
020       Following that approach, a comparison study is reported here among different network topologies in terms of their controllability. The effects of heterogeneity in the degree distribution, as well as of degree correlation and community structure, are discussed.

020       Only recently its study has started to draw interest from the EC community, the first paper dealing with it having been published two years ago. In this paper we will study the co-authorship network of EC at a microscopic level. Our objective is ascertaining which are the most relevant nodes (i.e. authors) in it. For this purpose, we examine several metrics defined in the complex-network literature, and analyze them both in isolation and combined within a Pareto-dominance approach. The result of our analysis indicates that there are some well-known researchers that appear systematically in top rankings. This also provides some hints on the social behavior of our community.

010       Robustness of Attractor States in Complex Networks with Scale-free   Topology
021       We study the intrinsic properties of attractors in the Boolean dynamics in complex network with scale-free topology, comparing with those of the so-called random Kauffman networks. 
020       We have numerically investigated the frozen and relevant nodes for each attractor, and the robustness of the attractors to the perturbation that flips the state of a single node of attractors in the relatively small network ($N=30 \sim 200$). It is shown that the rate of frozen nodes in the complex networks with scale-free topology is larger than that in the random Kauffman model. Furthermore, we have found that in the complex scale-free networks with fluctuations of in-degree number the attractors are more sensitive to the state flip of a highly connected node than to the state flip of a less connected node.

010       Graph Annotations in Modeling Complex Network Topologies
021       The coarsest approximation of the structure of a complex network, such as the Internet, is a simple undirected unweighted graph. 
020       This approximation, however, loses too much detail. In reality, objects represented by vertices and edges in such a graph possess some non-trivial internal structure that varies across and differentiates among distinct types of links or nodes. In this work, we abstract such additional information as network annotations. We introduce a network topology modeling framework that treats annotations as an extended correlation profile of a network. Assuming we have this profile measured for a given network, we present an algorithm to rescale it in order to construct networks of varying size that still reproduce the original measured annotation profile. <br />Using this methodology, we accurately capture the network properties essential for realistic simulations of network applications and protocols, or any other simulations involving complex network topologies, including modeling and simulation of network evolution. We apply our approach to the Autonomous System (AS) topology of the Internet annotated with business relationships between ASs. This topology captures the large-scale structure of the Internet. In depth understanding of this structure and tools to model it are cornerstones of research on future Internet architectures and designs. We find that our techniques are able to accurately capture the structure of annotation correlations within this topology, thus reproducing a number of its important properties in synthetically-generated random graphs.

010       A limited resource model of fault-tolerant capability against cascading   failure of complex network
021       We propose a novel capacity model for complex networks against cascading failure. 
020       In this model, vertices with both higher loads and larger degrees should be paid more extra capacities, i.e. the allocation of extra capacity on vertex $i$ will be proportional to $ k_{i}^{\gamma} $, where $ k_{i}$ is the degree of vertex $i$ and $\gamma&gt;0$ is a free parameter. We have applied this model on Barab\'asi-Albert network as well as two real transportation networks, and found that under the same amount of available resource, this model can achieve better network robustness than previous models.

010       Generation of arbitrarily two-point correlated random networks
021       Random networks are intensively used as null models to investigate properties of complex networks. 
020       We describe an efficient and accurate algorithm to generate arbitrarily two-point correlated undirected random networks without self- or multiple-edges among vertices. With the goal to systematically investigate the influence of two-point correlations, we furthermore develop a formalism to construct a joint degree distribution $P(j,k)$ which allows to fix an arbitrary degree distribution $P(k)$ and an arbitrary average nearest neighbor function $\knn(k)$ simultaneously. Using the presented algorithm, this formalism is demonstrated with scale-free networks ($P(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}$) and empirical complex networks ($P(k)$ taken from network) as examples. Finally, we generalize our algorithm to annealed networks which allows networks to be represented in a mean-field like manner.

010       Laplacian Spectra as a Diagnostic Tool for Network Structure and   Dynamics
021       We examine numerically the three-way relationships among structure, Laplacian spectra and frequency synchronization dynamics on complex networks. 
020       We study the effects of clustering, degree distribution and a particular type of coupling asymmetry (input normalization), all of which are known to have effects on the synchronizability of oscillator networks. We find that these topological factors produce marked signatures in the Laplacian eigenvalue distribution and in the localization properties of individual eigenvectors. Using a set of coordinates based on the Laplacian eigenvectors as a diagnostic tool for synchronization dynamics, we find that the process of frequency synchronization can be visualized as a series of quasi-independent transitions involving different normal modes. Particular features of the partially synchronized state can be understood in terms of the behavior of particular modes or groups of modes. For example, there are important partially synchronized states in which a set of low-lying modes remain unlocked while those in the main spectral peak are locked. We find therefore that spectra influence dynamics in ways that go beyond results relating a single threshold to a single extremal eigenvalue.

010       Navigability of Complex Networks
021       Routing information through networks is a universal phenomenon in both natural and manmade complex systems. 
020       When each node has full knowledge of the global network connectivity, finding short communication paths is merely a matter of distributed computation. However, in many real networks nodes communicate efficiently even without such global intelligence. Here we show that the peculiar structural characteristics of many complex networks support efficient communication without global knowledge. We also describe a general mechanism that explains this connection between network structure and function. This mechanism relies on the presence of a metric space hidden behind an observable network. Our findings suggest that real networks in nature have underlying metric spaces that remain undiscovered. Their discovery would have practical applications ranging from routing in the Internet and searching social networks, to studying information flows in neural, gene regulatory networks, or signaling pathways.

010       Emergence of Symmetry in Complex Networks
021       Many real networks have been found to have a rich degree of symmetry, which is a very important structural property of complex network, yet has been rarely studied so far. 
020       And where does symmetry comes from has not been explained. To explore the mechanism underlying symmetry of the networks, we studied statistics of certain local symmetric motifs, such as symmetric bicliques and generalized symmetric bicliques, which contribute to local symmetry of networks. We found that symmetry of complex networks is a consequence of similar linkage pattern, which means that nodes with similar degree tend to share similar linkage targets. A improved version of BA model integrating similar linkage pattern successfully reproduces the symmetry of real networks, indicating that similar linkage pattern is the underlying ingredient that responsible for the emergence of the symmetry in complex networks.

010       Impact of community structure on information transfer
021       The observation that real complex networks have internal structure has important implication for dynamic processes occurring on such topologies. 
020       Here we investigate the impact of community structure on a model of information transfer able to deal with both search and congestion simultaneously. We show that networks with fuzzy community structure are more efficient in terms of packet delivery that those with pronounced community structure. We also propose an alternative packet routing algorithm which takes advantage of the knowledge of communities to improve information transfer and show that in the context of the model an intermediate level of community structure is optimal. Finally, we show that in a hierarchical network setting, providing knowledge of communities at the level of highest modularity will improve network capacity by the largest amount.

010       Biased random walks on complex networks: the role of local navigation   rules
021       We study the biased random walk process in random uncorrelated networks with arbitrary degree distributions. 
020       In our model, the bias is defined by the preferential transition probability, which, in recent years, has been commonly used to study efficiency of different routing protocols in communication networks. We derive exact expressions for the stationary occupation probability, and for the mean transit time between two nodes. The effect of the cyclic search on transit times is also explored. Results presented in this paper give the basis for theoretical treatment of the transport-related problems on complex networks, including quantitative estimation of the critical value of the packet generation rate.

010       Cross Comparison of Synonym Graphs in A Multi Linguistic Context
021       Language is one of the most important aspects of human cognition; it represents the way we think, act and communicate with each other. 
020       Each language has its own history, background, and form. A language represents a lot of important cultural aspects of the nation speaking it. Languages differ and so do cultures. In this paper we analyze cultural differences between East and West in a multi-linguistic context from a complex networks point of view. There has been considerable work on the topic of cultural differences by psychologist and sociologist. Also studies on complex networks that make use of WordNet have been done, but until now there is no previous work that uses WordNets from different Eastern and Western languages as complex lexical networks in order to obtain possible differences or similarities between the cultures using those respective languages. Our work aims to do this.

021       The force networks of different granular ensembles are defined and their topological properties studied using the tools of complex networks. 
020       In particular, for each set of grains compressed in a square box, it is introduced a force threshold that determines which contacts conform the network. Hence, the topological characteristics of the network are analyzed as a function of this parameter. The characterization of the structural features thus obtained, may be useful in the understanding of the macroscopic physical behavior exhibited by this class of media.

010       Random Walk Access Times on Partially-Disordered Complex Networks: an   Effective Medium Theory
021       An analytic effective medium theory is constructed to study the mean access times for random walks on hybrid disordered structures formed by embedding complex networks into regular lattices, considering transition rates $F$ that are different for steps across lattice bonds from the rates $f$ across network shortcuts. 
020       The theory is developed for structures with arbitrary shortcut distributions and applied to a class of partially-disordered traversal enhanced networks in which shortcuts of fixed length are distributed randomly with finite probability. Numerical simulations are found to be in excellent agreement with predictions of the effective medium theory on all aspects addressed by the latter. Access times for random walks on these partially disordered structures are compared to those on small-world networks, which on average appear to provide the most effective means of decreasing access times uniformly across the network.

010       Modeling Metropolis Public Transport
021       We present results of a survey of public transport networks (PTNs) of selected 14 major cities of the world with PTN sizes ranging between 2000 and 46000 stations and develop an evolutionary model of these networks. 
020       The structure of these PTNs is revealed in terms of a set of neighbourhood relations both for the routes and the stations. The networks defined in this way display distinguishing properties due to the constraints of the embedding 2D geographical space and the structure of the cities. In addition to the standard characteristics of complex networks like the number of nearest neighbours, mean path length, and clustering we observe features specific to PTNs. While other networks with real-world links like cables or neurons embedded in two or three dimensions often show similar behavior, these can be studied in detail in our present case. Geographical data for the routes reveal surprising self-avoiding walk properties that we relate to the optimization of surface coverage. We propose and simulate an evolutionary growth model based on effectively interacting self-avoiding walks that reproduces the key features of PTN.

010       Attack Vulnerability of Public Transport Networks
021       The behavior of complex networks under attack depends strongly on the specific attack scenario. 
020       Of special interest are scale-free networks, which are usually seen as robust under random failure or attack but appear to be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. In a recent study of public transport networks of 14 major cities of the world we have shown that these networks may exhibit scale-free behaviour [Physica A 380, 585 (2007)]. Our further analysis, subject of this report, focuses on the effects that defunct or removed nodes have on the properties of public transport networks. Simulating different attack strategies we elaborate vulnerability criteria that allow to find minimal strategies with high impact on these systems.

010       K-Scaffold subgraphs of Complex networks
021       Complex networks with high numbers of nodes or links are often difficult to analyse. 
020       However, not all elements contribute equally to their structural patterns. A small number of elements (the hubs) seem to play a particularly relevant role in organizing the overall structure around them. But other parts of the architecture (such as hub-hub connecting elements) are also important. In this letter we present a new type of substructure, to be named the $K$-scaffold subgraph, able to capture all the essential network components. Their key features, including the so called critical scaffold graph, are analytically derived.

010       Star Formation at Very Low Metallicity. IV. Fragmentation Does Not   Depend on Metallicity for Cold Initial Conditions
021       Primordial star formation appears to result in stars at least an order of magnitude more massive than modern star formation. 
020       It has been proposed that the transition from primordial to modern initial mass functions occurs due to the onset of effective metal line cooling at a metallicity Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}. However, these simulations neglected molecular hydrogen cooling. We perform simulations using the same initial conditions, but including molecular cooling, using a complex network that follows molecular hydrogen formation and also directly follows carbon monoxide and water. We find that molecular hydrogen cooling allows roughly equivalent fragmentation to proceed even at zero metallicity for these initial conditions. The apparent transition just represents the point where metal line cooling becomes more important than molecular cooling. In all cases, the fragments are massive enough to be consistent with models of primordial stellar masses, suggesting that the transition to the modern initial mass function may be determined by other physics such as dust formation. We conclude that such additional cooling mechanisms, combined with the exact initial conditions produced by cosmological collapse are likely more important than metal line cooling in determining the initial mass function, and thus that there is unlikely to be a sharp transition in the initial mass function at Z/Z_sun = 10^{-3.5}.

010       Emergence of Scale-Free Syntax Networks
021       The evolution of human language allowed the efficient propagation of nongenetic information, thus creating a new form of evolutionary change. 
020       Language development in children offers the opportunity of exploring the emergence of such complex communication system and provides a window to understanding the transition from protolanguage to language. Here we present the first analysis of the emergence of syntax in terms of complex networks. A previously unreported, sharp transition is shown to occur around two years of age from a (pre-syntactic) tree-like structure to a scale-free, small world syntax network. The nature of such transition supports the presence of an innate component pervading the emergence of full syntax. This observation is difficult to interpret in terms of any simple model of network growth, thus suggesting that some internal, perhaps innate component was at work. We explore this problem by using a minimal model that is able to capture several statistical traits. Our results provide evidence for adaptive traits, but it also indicates that some key features of syntax might actually correspond to non-adaptive phenomena.

We show how motifs can be used to define general classes of nodes, including communities, by extending the mathematical expression of Newman-Girvan modularity. We construct then a general framework and apply it to some synthetic and real networks.

010       Symmetry based Structure Entropy of Complex Networks
021       Precisely quantifying the heterogeneity or disorder of a network system is very important and desired in studies of behavior and function of the network system. 
020       Although many degree-based entropies have been proposed to measure the heterogeneity of real networks, heterogeneity implicated in the structure of networks can not be precisely quantified yet. Hence, we propose a new structure entropy based on automorphism partition to precisely quantify the structural heterogeneity of networks. Analysis of extreme cases shows that entropy based on automorphism partition can quantify the structural heterogeneity of networks more precisely than degree-based entropy. We also summarized symmetry and heterogeneity statistics of many real networks, finding that real networks are indeed more heterogenous in the view of automorphism partition than what have been depicted under the measurement of degree based entropies; and that structural heterogeneity is strongly negatively correlated to symmetry of real networks.

010       Complex Network Analysis of State Spaces for Random Boolean Networks
021       We apply complex network analysis to the state spaces of random Boolean networks (RBNs). 
020       An RBN contains $N$ Boolean elements each with $K$ inputs. A directed state space network (SSN) is constructed by linking each dynamical state, represented as a node, to its temporal successor. We study the heterogeneity of an SSN at both local and global scales, as well as sample-to-sample fluctuations within an ensemble of SSNs. We use in-degrees of nodes as a local topological measure, and the path diversity [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 198701 (2007)] of an SSN as a global topological measure. RBNs with $2 \leq K \leq 5$ exhibit non-trivial fluctuations at both local and global scales, while K=2 exhibits the largest sample-to-sample, possibly non-self-averaging, fluctuations. We interpret the observed ``multi scale'' fluctuations in the SSNs as indicative of the criticality and complexity of K=2 RBNs. ``Garden of Eden'' (GoE) states are nodes on an SSN that have in-degree zero. While in-degrees of non-GoE nodes for $K&gt;1$ SSNs can assume any integer value between 0 and $2^N$, for K=1 all the non-GoE nodes in an SSN have the same in-degree which is always a power of two.

010       Topological phase transition in complex networks
021       Preferential attachment is a central paradigm in the theory of complex networks. 
020       In this contribution we consider various generalizations of preferential attachment including for example node removal and edge rewiring. We demonstrate that generalized preferential attachment networks can undergo a topological phase transition. This transition separates networks having a power-law tail degree distribution from those with an exponential tail. The appearance of the phase transition is closely related to the breakdown of the continuous variable description of the network dynamics.

The expected time of recurrence and the expected first passage time to a node scales apparently linearly in all urban patterns we have studied In space syntax theory, a positive relation between the local property of a node (qualified by connectivity or by the recurrence time) and the global property of the node (estimated in our approach by the first passage time to it) is known as intelligibility. Our approach based on random walks allows to extend the notion of intelligibility onto the entire domain of complex networks and graph theory.

010       Finite-size scaling of synchronized oscillation on complex networks
021       The onset of synchronization in a system of random frequency oscillators coupled through a random network is investigated. 
020       Using a mean-field approximation, we characterize sample-to-sample fluctuations for networks of finite size, and derive the corresponding scaling properties in the critical region. For scale-free networks with the degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$ at large $k$, we found that the finite size exponent $\bar{\nu}$ takes on the value 5/2 when $\gamma&gt;5$, the same as in the globally coupled Kuramoto model. For highly heterogeneous networks ($3&lt;\gamma &lt;5$), $\bar{\nu}$ and the order parameter exponent $\beta$ depend on $\gamma$. The analytic expressions for these exponents obtained from the mean field theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with data from extensive numerical simulations.

010       Eigenmode of Decision-By-Majority Process on Complex Networks
021       The nature of dynamics of opinion formation modeled as a decision-by-majority process in complex networks is investigated using eigenmode analysis. 
020       Hamiltonian of the system is defined, and estimated by eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix constructed from several network models. The eigenmodes of initial and final state of the dynamics are analyzed by numerical studies. We show that the magnitude of the largest eigenvector at the initial states are key determinant for the resulting dynamics.

010       Structural efficiency of percolation landscapes in flow networks
021       Complex networks characterized by global transport processes rely on the presence of directed paths from input to output nodes and edges, which organize in characteristic linked components. 
020       The analysis of such network-spanning structures in the framework of percolation theory, and in particular the key role of edge interfaces bridging the communication between core and periphery, allow us to shed light on the structural properties of real and theoretical flow networks, and to define criteria and quantities to characterize their efficiency at the interplay between structure and functionality. In particular, it is possible to assess that an optimal flow network should look like a "hairy ball", so to minimize bottleneck effects and the sensitivity to failures. Moreover, the thorough analysis of two real networks, the Internet customer-provider set of relationships at the autonomous system level and the nervous system of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans --that have been shaped by very different dynamics and in very different time-scales--, reveals that whereas biological evolution has selected a structure close to the optimal layout, market competition does not necessarily tend toward the most customer efficient architecture.

010       Concentric Characterization and Classification of Complex Network Nodes:   Theory and Application to Institutional Collaboration
021       Differently from theoretical scale-free networks, most of real networks present multi-scale behavior with nodes structured in different types of functional groups and communities. 
020       While the majority of approaches for classification of nodes in a complex network has relied on local measurements of the topology/connectivity around each node, valuable information about node functionality can be obtained by Concentric (or Hierarchical) Measurements. In this paper we explore the possibility of using a set of Concentric Measurements and agglomerative clustering methods in order to obtain a set of functional groups of nodes. Concentric clustering coefficient and convergence ratio are chosen as segregation parameters for the analysis of a institutional collaboration network including various known communities (departments of the University of S\~ao Paulo). A dendogram is obtained and the results are analyzed and discussed. Among the interesting obtained findings, we emphasize the scale-free nature of the obtained network, as well as the identification of different patterns of authorship emerging from different areas (e.g. human and exact sciences). Another interesting result concerns the relatively uniform distribution of hubs along the concentric levels, contrariwise to the non-uniform pattern found in theoretical scale free networks such as the BA model.

010       Self-similarity of complex networks and hidden metric spaces
021       We demonstrate that the self-similarity of some scale-free networks with respect to a simple degree-thresholding renormalization scheme finds a natural interpretation in the assumption that network nodes exist in hidden metric spaces. 
020       Clustering, i.e., cycles of length three, plays a crucial role in this framework as a topological reflection of the triangle inequality in the hidden geometry. We prove that a class of hidden variable models with underlying metric spaces are able to accurately reproduce the self-similarity properties that we measured in the real networks. Our findings indicate that hidden geometries underlying these real networks are a plausible explanation for their observed topologies and, in particular, for their self-similarity with respect to the degree-based renormalization.

010       Efficient Simulations of Interstellar Gas-Grain Chemistry Using Moment   Equations
021       Networks of reactions on dust grain surfaces play a crucial role in the chemistry of interstellar clouds, leading to the formation of molecular hydrogen in diffuse clouds as well as various organic molecules in dense molecular clouds. 
020       Due to the sub-micron size of the grains and the low flux, the population of reactive species per grain may be very small and strongly fluctuating. Under these conditions rate equations fail and the simulation of surface-reaction networks requires stochastic methods such as the master equation. However, the master equation becomes infeasible for complex networks because the number of equations proliferates exponentially. Here we introduce a method based on moment equations for the simulation of reaction networks on small grains. The number of equations is reduced to just one equation per reactive specie and one equation per reaction. Nevertheless, the method provides accurate results, which are in excellent agreement with the master equation. The method is demonstrated for the methanol network which has been recently shown to be of crucial importance.

010       Evaluation of the Multiplane Method for Efficient Simulations of   Reaction Networks
021       Reaction networks in the bulk and on surfaces are widespread in physical, chemical and biological systems. 
020       In macroscopic systems, which include large populations of reactive species, stochastic fluctuations are negligible and the reaction rates can be evaluated using rate equations. However, many physical systems are partitioned into microscopic domains, where the number of molecules in each domain is small and fluctuations are strong. Under these conditions, the simulation of reaction networks requires stochastic methods such as direct integration of the master equation. However, direct integration of the master equation is infeasible for complex networks, because the number of equations proliferates as the number of reactive species increases. Recently, the multiplane method, which provides a dramatic reduction in the number of equations, was introduced [A. Lipshtat and O. Biham, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 170601 (2004)]. The reduction is achieved by breaking the network into a set of maximal fully connected sub-networks (maximal cliques). Lower-dimensional master equations are constructed for the marginal probability distributions associated with the cliques, with suitable couplings between them. In this paper we test the multiplane method and examine its applicability. We show that the method is accurate in the limit of small domains, where fluctuations are strong. It thus provides an efficient framework for the stochastic simulation of complex reaction networks with strong fluctuations, for which rate equations fail and direct integration of the master equation is infeasible. The method also applies in the case of large domains, where it converges to the rate equation results.

010       Structural dependence of robustness and load tolerance in scale-free   networks
021       The structure of complex networks in previous research has been widely described as scale-free networks generated by the preferential attachment model. 
020       However, the preferential attachment model does not take into account the detailed topological property observed in real networks. Here we propose the models of scale-free networks which can reproduce the topological assortativity of real networks. With an identical degree distribution and network size, we study the structural robustness and fragility as well as the dynamic change of load intensity when nodes are successively removed under random and various intentional attack strategies. We find that disassortative networks are structurally robust against random attacks and highly load-tolerant, while assortative networks are most resistant to intentional attacks yet significantly fragile against random attacks.

010       The process of coevolutionary competitive exclusion: speciation,   multifractality and power-laws in correlation
021       Competitive exclusion, a key principle of ecology, can be generalized to understand many other complex systems. 
020       Individuals under surviving pressure tend to be different from others, and correlations among them change correspondingly to the updating of their states. We show with numerical simulation that these aptitudes can contribute to group formation or speciation in social fields. Moreover, they can lead to power-law topological correlations of complex networks. By coupling updating states of nodes with variation of connections in a network, structural properties with power-laws and functions like multifractality, spontaneous ranking and evolutionary branching of node states can emerge out simultaneously from the present self-organized model of coevolutionary process.

021       In this paper, the problem of pinning control for synchronization of complex dynamical networks is discussed. 
020       A cost function of the controlled network is defined by the feedback gain and the coupling strength of the network. An interesting result is that lower cost is achieved by the control scheme of pinning nodes with smaller degrees. Some rigorous mathematical analysis is presented for achieving lower cost in the synchronization of different star-shaped networks. Numerical simulations on some non-regular complex networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and various star-shaped networks are shown for verification and illustration.

010       L2 norm performance index of synchronization and optimal control   synthesis of complex networks
021       In this paper, the synchronizability problem of dynamical networks is addressed, where better synchronizability means that the network synchronizes faster with lower-overshoot. 
020       The L2 norm of the error vector e is taken as a performance index to measure this kind of synchronizability. For the equilibrium synchronization case, it is shown that there is a close relationship between the L2 norm of the error vector e and the H2 norm of the transfer function G of the linearized network about the equilibrium point. Consequently, the effect of the network coupling topology on the H2 norm of the transfer function G is analyzed. Finally, an optimal controller is designed, according to the so-called LQR problem in modern control theory, which can drive the whole network to its equilibrium point and meanwhile minimize the L2 norm of the output of the linearized network.

We verify the algorithm by using empirical networks as input and describe additionally a simple way to fix a degree-dependent clustering function if degree-degree correlations are given.

010       Complex Networks: Time-Dependent Connections and Silent Nodes
021       We studied, both analytically and numerically, complex excitable networks, in which connections are time dependent and some of the nodes remain silent at each time step. 
020       More specifically, (a) there is a heterogenous distribution of connection weights and, depending on the current degree of order, some connections are reinforced/weakened with strength Phi on short-time scales, and (b) only a fraction rho of nodes are simultaneously active. The resulting dynamics has attractors which, for a range of Phi values and rho exceeding a threshold, become unstable, the instability depending critically on the value of rho. We observe that (i) the activity describes a trajectory in which the close neighborhood of some of the attractors is constantly visited, (ii) the number of attractors visited increases with rho, and (iii) the trajectory may change from regular to chaotic and vice versa as rho is, even slightly modified. Furthermore, (iv) time series show a power-law spectra under conditions in which the attractors' space is most efficiently explored. We argue on the possible qualitative relevance of this phenomenology to networks in several natural contexts.

010       Priority diffusion model in lattices and complex networks
021       We introduce a model for diffusion of two classes of particles ($A$ and $B$) with priority: where both species are present in the same site the motion of $A$'s takes precedence over that of $B$'s. 
020       This describes realistic situations in wireless and communication networks. In regular lattices the diffusion of the two species is normal but the $B$ particles are significantly slower, due to the presence of the $A$ particles. From the fraction of sites where the $B$ particles can move freely, which we compute analytically, we derive the diffusion coefficients of the two species. In heterogeneous networks the fraction of sites where $B$ is free decreases exponentially with the degree of the sites. This, coupled with accumulation of particles in high-degree nodes leads to trapping of the low priority particles in scale-free networks.

020       We analyze the degree distribution in the threshold model, a preferential attachment model where the affinity between node states biases the attachment probabilities of links. We show that the degree densities exhibit a power-law multiscaling which points to a signature of heterogeneity in preferential attachment networks. This translates into a power-law scaling in the degree distribution, whose exponent depends on the specific form of heterogeneity in the attachment mechanism.

010       Community Detecting By Signaling on Complex Networks
021       Based on signaling process on complex networks, a method for identification community structure is proposed. 
020       For a network with $n$ nodes, every node is assumed to be a system which can send, receive, and record signals. Each node is taken as the initial signal source once to inspire the whole network by exciting its neighbors and then the source node is endowed a $n$d vector which recording the effects of signaling process. So by this process, the topological relationship of nodes on networks could be transferred into the geometrical structure of vectors in $n$d Euclidian space. Then the best partition of groups is determined by $F$-statistic and the final community structure is given by Fuzzy $C$-means clustering method (FCM). This method can detect community structure both in unweighted and weighted networks without any extra parameters. It has been applied to ad hoc networks and some real networks including Zachary Karate Club network and football team network. The results are compared with that of other approaches and the evidence indicates that the algorithm based on signaling process is effective.

010       Synchronization on complex networks with different sorts of communities
021       In this paper, inspired by the idea that many real networks are composed by different sorts of communities, we investigate the synchronization property of oscillators on such networks. 
020       We identify the communities by the intrinsic frequencies probability density $g(\omega)$ of Kuramoto oscillators. That is to say, communities in different sorts are functional different. For a network containing two sorts of communities, when the community strength is strong, only the oscillators in the same community synchronize. With the weakening of the community strength, an interesting phenomenon, \emph{Community Grouping}, appears: although the global synchronization is not achieved, oscillators in the same sort of communities will synchronize. Global synchronization will appear with the further reducing of the community strength, and the oscillators will rotate around the average frequency.

020       I then consider the role of random walks in complex networks and show how they may be used to explain why so many long tailed distributions are found in real data sets. The key idea is that in many cases the process involves copying of properties of near neighbours in the network and this is a type of short random walk which in turn produce a natural preferential attachment mechanism. Applying this to networks of fixed size I show that copying and innovation are processes with special mathematical properties which include the ability to solve a simple model exactly for any parameter values and at any time. I finish by looking at variations of this basic model.

010       The Path-Star Transformation and its Effects on Complex Networks
021       A good deal of the connectivity of complex networks can be characterized in terms of their constituent paths and hubs. 
020       For instance, the Barab\'asi-Albert model is known to incorporate a significative number of hubs and relatively short paths. On the other hand, the Watts-Strogatz model is underlain by a long path and almost complete absence of hubs. The present work investigates how the topology of complex networks changes when a path is transformed into a star (or, for long paths, a hub). Such a transformation keeps the number of nodes and does not increase the number of edges in the network, but has potential for greatly changing the network topology. Several interesting results are reported with respect to Erdos-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert and Watts-Strogats models, including the unexpected finding that the diameter and average shortest path length of the former type of networks are little affected by the path-star transformation. In addition to providing insight about the organization of complex networks, such transformations are also potentially useful for improving specific aspects of the network connectivity, e.g. average shortest path length as required for expedite communication between nodes.

010       On the effects of geographical constraints on task execution in complex   networks
021       In the present work we investigate the effects of spatial constraints on the efficiency of task execution in systems underlain by geographical complex networks where the probability of connection decreases with the distance between the nodes. 
020       The investigation considers several configurations of the parameters defining the network connectivity, and the Barabasi-Albert network model is also considered for comparisons. The results show that the effect of connectivity is significant only for shorter tasks, that the locality of connections implied by the spatial constraints reduces efficency, and that the addition of edges can improve the efficiency of the execution, although with increasing locality of the connections the improvement is small.

010       Enhancing synchronization in complex networks of coupled phase   oscillators
021       By a model of coupled phase oscillators, we show analytically how synchronization in {\em non-identical} complex networks can be enhanced by introducing a proper gradient into the couplings. 
020       It is found that, by pointing the gradient from the large-degree to the small-degree nodes on each link, increasing the gradient strength will bring forward the {\em onset} of network synchronization monotonically, and, under the same gradient strength, heterogeneous networks are more synchronizable than homogeneous networks. These findings are verified by extensive simulations.

021       A new dynamical clustering algorithm for the identification of modules in complex networks has been recently introduced \cite{BILPR}. 
020       In this paper we present a modified version of this algorithm based on a system of chaotic Roessler oscillators and we test its sensitivity on real and computer generated networks with a well known modular structure.

010       Finite size effects and symmetry breaking in the evolution of networks   of competing Boolean nodes
021       The effects of the finite size of the network on the evolutionary dynamics of a Boolean network are analyzed. 
020       In the model considered, Boolean networks evolve via a competition between nodes that punishes those in the majority. It is found that finite size networks evolve in a fundamentally different way than infinitely large networks do. The symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics of infinitely large networks that selects for canalizing Boolean functions is broken in the evolutionary dynamics of finite size networks. In finite size networks there is an additional selection for input inverting Boolean functions that output a value opposite to the majority of input values. These results are revealed through an empirical study of the model that calculates the frequency of occurrence of the different possible Boolean functions. Classes of functions are found to occur with the same frequency. Those classes depend on the symmetry of the evolutionary dynamics and correspond to orbits of the relevant symmetry group. The empirical results match analytic results, determined by utilizing Polya's theorem, for the number of orbits expected in both finite size and infinitely large networks. The reason for the symmetry breaking in the evolutionary dynamics is found to be due to the need for nodes in finite size networks to behave differently in order to cooperate so that the system collectively performs as well as possible. The results suggest that both finite size effects and symmetry are important for understanding the evolution of real-world complex networks, including genetic regulatory networks.

010       Modeling Protein Contact Networks
021       Proteins are an important class of biomolecules that serve as essential building blocks of the cells. 
020       Their three-dimensional structures are responsible for their functions. In this thesis we have investigated the protein structures using a network theoretical approach. While doing so we used a coarse-grained method, viz., complex network analysis. We model protein structures at two length scales as Protein Contact Networks (PCN) and as Long-range Interaction Networks (LINs). We found that proteins by virtue of being characterised by high amount of clustering, are small-world networks. Apart from the small-world nature, we found that proteins have another general property, viz., assortativity. This is an interesting and exceptional finding as all other complex networks (except for social networks) are known to be disassortative. Importantly, we could identify one of the major topological determinant of assortativity by building appropriate controls.

010       Assortative mixing in Protein Contact Networks and protein folding   kinetics
021       Starting from linear chains of amino acids, the spontaneous folding of proteins into their elaborate three-dimensional structures is one of the remarkable examples of biological self-organization. 
020       We investigated native state structures of 30 single-domain, two-state proteins, from complex networks perspective, to understand the role of topological parameters in proteins' folding kinetics, at two length scales-- as ``Protein Contact Networks (PCNs)'' and their corresponding ``Long-range Interaction Networks (LINs)'' constructed by ignoring the short-range interactions. Our results show that, both PCNs and LINs exhibit the exceptional topological property of ``assortative mixing'' that is absent in all other biological and technological networks studied so far. We show that the degree distribution of these contact networks is partly responsible for the observed assortativity. The coefficient of assortativity also shows a positive correlation with the rate of protein folding at both short and long contact scale, whereas, the clustering coefficients of only the LINs exhibit a negative correlation. The results indicate that the general topological parameters of these naturally-evolved protein networks can effectively represent the structural and functional properties required for fast information transfer among the residues facilitating biochemical/kinetic functions, such as, allostery, stability, and the rate of folding.

010       Knitted Complex Networks
021       To a considerable extent, the continuing importance and popularity of complex networks as models of real-world structures has been motivated by scale free degree distributions as well as the respectively implied hubs. 
020       Being related to sequential connections of edges in networks, paths represent another important, dual pattern of connectivity (or motif) in complex networks (e.g., paths are related to important concepts such as betweeness centrality). The present work proposes a new supercategory of complex networks which are organized and/or constructed in terms of paths. Two specific network classes are proposed and characterized: (i) PA networks, obtained by star-path transforming Barabasi-Albert networks; and (ii) PN networks, built by performing progressive paths involving all nodes without repetition. Such new networks are important not only from their potential to provide theoretical insights, but also as putative models of real-world structures. The connectivity structure of these two models is investigated comparatively to four traditional complex networks models (Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and a geographical model). A series of interesting results are described, including the corroboration of the distinct nature of the two proposed models and the importance of considering a comprehensive set of measurements and multivariated statistical methods for the characterization of complex networks.

010       Epcast: Controlled Dissemination in Human-based Wireless Networks by   means of Epidemic Spreading Models
021       Epidemics-inspired techniques have received huge attention in recent years from the distributed systems and networking communities. 
020       These algorithms and protocols rely on probabilistic message replication and redundancy to ensure reliable communication. Moreover, they have been successfully exploited to support group communication in distributed systems, broadcasting, multicasting and information dissemination in fixed and mobile networks. However, in most of the existing work, the probability of infection is determined heuristically, without relying on any analytical model. This often leads to unnecessarily high transmission overheads. <br />In this paper we show that models of epidemic spreading in complex networks can be applied to the problem of tuning and controlling the dissemination of information in wireless ad hoc networks composed of devices carried by individuals, i.e., human-based networks. The novelty of our idea resides in the evaluation and exploitation of the structure of the underlying human network for the automatic tuning of the dissemination process in order to improve the protocol performance. We evaluate the results using synthetic mobility models and real human contacts traces.

010       Solvable Metric Growing Networks
021       Structure and dynamics of complex networks usually deal with degree distributions, clustering, shortest path lengths and other graph properties. 
020       Although these concepts have been analysed for graphs on abstract spaces, many networks happen to be embedded in a metric arrangement, where the geographic distance between vertices plays a crucial role. The present work proposes a model for growing network that takes into account the geographic distance between vertices: the probability that they are connected is higher if they are located nearer than farther. In this framework, the mean degree of vertices, degree distribution and shortest path length between two randomly chosen vertices are analysed.

020       Both continuous time and discrete time systems are considered. We initially focus on the case where two groups are present and the network has bipartite topology (i.e., links exist between nodes in different groups but not between nodes in the same group). We also show that group synchronous motions are compatible with more general network topologies, where there are also connections within the groups.

In addition, the entropy rate is used to characterize complex networks from the real world. Our results point out how to design optimal diffusion processes that maximize the entropy for a given network structure, providing a new theoretical tool with applications to social, technological and communication networks.

010       Random and Longest Paths: Unnoticed Motifs of Complex Networks
021       Paths are important structural elements in complex networks because they are finite (unlike walks), related to effective node coverage (minimum spanning trees), and can be understood as being dual to star connectivity. 
020       This article introduces the concept of random path applies it for the investigation of structural properties of complex networks and as the means to estimate the longest path. Random paths are obtained by selecting one of the network nodes at random and performing a random self-avoiding walk (here called path-walk) until its termination. It is shown that the distribution of random paths are markedly different for diverse complex network models (i.e. Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, a geographical model, as well as two recently introduced path-based network types), with the BA structures yielding the shortest random walks, while the longest paths are produced by WS networks. Random paths are also explored as the means to estimate the longest paths (i.e. several random paths are obtained and the longest taken). The convergence to the longest path and its properties ire characterized with respect to several networks models. Several results are reported and discussed, including the markedly distinct lengths of the longest paths obtained for the different network models.

010       Nested Subgraphs of Complex Networks
021       We analytically explore the scaling properties of a general class of nested subgraphs in complex networks, which includes the $K$-core and the $K$-scaffold, among others. 
020       We name such class of subgraphs $K$-nested subgraphs due to the fact that they generate families of subgraphs such that $...S_{K+1}({\cal G})\subseteq S_K({\cal G})\subseteq S_{K-1}({\cal G})...$. Using the so-called {\em configuration model} it is shown that any family of nested subgraphs over a network with diverging second moment and finite first moment has infinite elements (i.e. lacking a percolation threshold). Moreover, for a scale-free network with the above properties, we show that any nested family of subgraphs is self-similar by looking at the degree distribution. Both numerical simulations and real data are analyzed and display good agreement with our theoretical predictions.

010       A Collaboration Network Model Of Cytokine-Protein Network
021       Complex networks provide us a new view for investigation of immune systems. 
020       In this paper we collect data through STRING database and present a model with cooperation network theory. The cytokine-protein network model we consider is constituted by two kinds of nodes, one is immune cytokine types which can act as acts, other one is protein type which can act as actors. From act degree distribution that can be well described by typical SPL -shifted power law functions, we find that HRAS.TNFRSF13C.S100A8.S100A1.MAPK8.S100A7.LIF.CCL4.CXCL13 are highly collaborated with other proteins. It reveals that these mediators are important in cytokine-protein network to regulate immune activity. Dyad act degree distribution is another important property to generalized collaboration network. Dyad is two proteins and they appear in one cytokine collaboration relationship. The dyad act degree distribution can be well described by typical SPL functions. The length of the average shortest path is 1.29. These results show that this model could describe the cytokine-protein collaboration preferably

010       The Price of Anarchy in Transportation Networks: Efficiency and   Optimality Control
021       Uncoordinated individuals in human society pursuing their personally optimal strategies do not always achieve the social optimum, the most beneficial state to the society as a whole. 
020       Instead, strategies form Nash equilibria which are often socially suboptimal. Society, therefore, has to pay a price of anarchy for the lack of coordination among its members. Here we assess this price of anarchy by analyzing the travel times in road networks of several major cities. Our simulation shows that uncoordinated drivers possibly waste a considerable amount of their travel time. Counterintuitively,simply blocking certain streets can partially improve the traffic conditions. We analyze various complex networks and discuss the possibility of similar paradoxes in physics.

010       Identification of functional information subgraphs in complex networks
021       We present a general information theoretic approach for identifying functional subgraphs in complex networks where the dynamics of each node are observable. 
020       We show that the uncertainty in the state of each node can be expressed as a sum of information quantities involving a growing number of correlated variables at other nodes. We demonstrate that each term in this sum is generated by successively conditioning mutual informations on new measured variables, in a way analogous to a discrete differential calculus. The analogy to a Taylor series suggests efficient search algorithms for determining the state of a target variable in terms of functional groups of other degrees of freedom. We apply this methodology to electrophysiological recordings of networks of cortical neurons grown it in vitro. Despite strong stochasticity, we show that each cell's patterns of firing are generally explained by the activity of a small number of other neurons. We identify these neuronal subgraphs in terms of their mutually redundant or synergetic character and reconstruct neuronal circuits that account for the state of each target cell.

010       Optimization and Scale-freeness for Complex Networks
021       Complex networks are mapped to a model of boxes and balls where the balls are distinguishable. 
020       It is shown that the scale-free size distribution of boxes maximizes the information associated with the boxes provided configurations including boxes containing a finite fraction of the total amount of balls are excluded. It is conjectured that for a connected network with only links between different nodes, the nodes with a finite fraction of links are effectively suppressed. It is hence suggested that for such networks the scale-free node-size distribution maximizes the information encoded on the nodes. The noise associated with the size distributions is also obtained from a maximum entropy principle. Finally explicit predictions from our least bias approach are found to be born out by metabolic networks.

021       One of the biggest realities before us today is our misinterpretation of the biotic processes and factors controlling the development of Earth. 
020       Ongoing surface biogeochemical processes determine the atmosphere-climate development. Marine microbiota is especially influential on the atmospheric processing. Arctic Ocean bromine emissions at polar sunrise lead to the bromine explosion phenomenon in the Arctic troposphere. The primary objective of this study is to provide the accumulated evidence and qualitative understanding of the particular biotic-abiotic atmospheric phenomena of the Arctic bromine explosion. Reviewing literature and model results, we hypothesize that during the bromine explosion season, total amounts of BrO and Bry of Arctic origin control the Northern Hemisphere (NH) tropospheric O3 field downward to 50 N. We discuss the statistical physical constraint which determines the tropospheric ozone field in the Northern Hemisphere throughout the bromine explosion season. The constraint is represented by total amounts of the tropospheric BrO and Bry of Arctic origin and by the ratio of these total amounts. The linkage of the model atmospheric system reflects on the natural forces in real atmosphere, which is a complex network of maximum complexity. In this paper, we analyze the network context of the natural bromine pollution. We rationalize an empirical expression for bromine flux. We suggest that demonstrated attitudinal approach to the distributed surface flux as to a complex network with rank linkage would be successfully used in the innovative atmospheric modeling. GEM model results stay in a good agreement with the observational data and support the original idea of the global NH effect of bromine chemistry. Obtained model amounts of BrO and Bry accommodate the satellite amounts of BrO.

010       Evolution equation for a model of surface relaxation in complex networks
021       In this paper we derive analytically the evolution equation of the interface for a model of surface growth with relaxation to the minimum (SRM) in complex networks. 
020       We were inspired by the disagreement between the scaling results of the steady state of the fluctuations between the discrete SRM model and the Edward-Wilkinson process found in scale-free networks with degree distribution $ P(k) \sim k^{-\lambda}$ for $\lambda &lt;3$ [Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 046117 (2007)]. Even though for Euclidean lattices the evolution equation is linear, we find that in complex heterogeneous networks non-linear terms appear due to the heterogeneity and the lack of symmetry of the network; they produce a logarithmic divergency of the saturation roughness with the system size as found by Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.} for $\lambda &lt;3$.

010       Offdiagonal complexity: A computationally quick network complexity   measure. Application to protein networks and cell division
021       Many complex biological, social, and economical networks show topologies drastically differing from random graphs. 
020       But, what is a complex network, i.e.\ how can one quantify the complexity of a graph? Here the Offdiagonal Complexity (OdC), a new, and computationally cheap, measure of complexity is defined, based on the node-node link cross-distribution, whose nondiagonal elements characterize the graph structure beyond link distribution, cluster coefficient and average path length. The OdC apporach is applied to the {\sl Helicobacter pylori} protein interaction network and randomly rewired surrogates thereof. In addition, OdC is used to characterize the spatial complexity of cell aggregates. We investigate the earliest embryo development states of Caenorhabditis elegans. The development states of the premorphogenetic phase are represented by symmetric binary-valued cell connection matrices with dimension growing from 4 to 385. These matrices can be interpreted as adjacency matrix of an undirected graph, or network. The OdC approach allows to describe quantitatively the complexity of the cell aggregate geometry.

010       On the Diversity of Non-Linear Transient Dynamics in Several Types of   Complex Networks
021       Dynamic systems characterized by diversified evolutions are not only more flexible, but also more resilient to attacks, failures and changing conditions. 
020       This article addresses the quantification of the diversity of non-linear transient dynamics obtained in undirected and unweighted complex networks as a consequence of self-avoiding random walks. The diversity of walks starting at a specific node $i$ is quantified in terms of a signature composed by the entropies of the node visit probabilities along each of the initial steps. Six theoretical models of complex networks are considered: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz, a geographical model, as well as two recently introduced knitted networks formed by paths. The random walk diversity is explored at the level of network categories and of individual nodes. Because the diversity at successive steps of the walks tends to be correlated, principal component analysis is systematically applied in order to identify the more relevant linear combinations of the diversity entropies and to obtain optimal dimensionality reduction. Several interesting results are reported, including the facts that the transient diversity tends to increase with the average degree for all considered network models and that the Watts and Strogatz and geographical models tend to yield diversity entropies which increase more gradually with the number of steps, contrasting sharply with the steep increases verified for the other four considered models. The principal linear combination of the diversities identified by the principal component analysis method is shown to allow an interesting characterization of individual nodes as well as partitioning of networks into subgraphs of similar diversity.

010       Extending the definition of modularity to directed graphs with   overlapping communities
021       Complex networks topologies present interesting and surprising properties, such as community structures, which can be exploited to optimize communication, to find new efficient and context-aware routing algorithms or simply to understand the dynamics and meaning of relationships among nodes. 
020       Complex networks are gaining more and more importance as a reference model and are a powerful interpretation tool for many different kinds of natural, biological and social networks, where directed relationships and contextual belonging of nodes to many different communities is a matter of fact. This paper starts from the definition of modularity function, given by M. Newman to evaluate the goodness of network community decompositions, and extends it to the more general case of directed graphs with overlapping community structures. Interesting properties of the proposed extension are discussed, a method for finding overlapping communities is proposed and results of its application to benchmark case-studies are reported. We also propose a new dataset which could be used as a reference benchmark for overlapping community structures identification.

010       Extended Pair Approximation of Evolutionary Game on Complex Networks
021       We investigate how network structure influences evolutionary games on networks. 
020       We extend the pair approximation to study the effects of degree fluctuation and clustering of the network. We find that a larger fluctuation of the degree is equivalent to a larger mobility of the players. In addition, a larger clustering coefficient is equivalent to a smaller number of neighbors.

010       Synchronization in Complex Systems Following the Decision Based Queuing   Process: The Rhythmic Applause as a Test Case
021       Living communities can be considered as complex systems, thus a fertile ground for studies related to their statistics and dynamics. 
020       In this study we revisit the case of the rhythmic applause by utilizing the model proposed by V\'azquez et al. [A. V\'azquez et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 036127 (2006)] augmented with two contradicted {\it driving forces}, namely: {\it Individuality} and {\it Companionship}. To that extend, after performing computer simulations with a large number of oscillators we propose an explanation on the following open questions (a) why synchronization occurs suddenly, and b) why synchronization is observed when the clapping period ($T_c$) is $1.5 \cdot T_s &lt; T_c &lt; 2.0 \cdot T_s$ ($T_s$ is the mean self period of the spectators) and is lost after a time. Moreover, based on the model, a weak preferential attachment principle is proposed which can produce complex networks obeying power law in the distribution of number edges per node with exponent greater than 3.

010       Inward and Outward Node Accessibility in Complex Networks as Revealed by   Non-Linear Dynamics
021       In this work, the outward and inward accessibilities of individual nodes are defined and their potential for application is illustrated with respect to the investigation of 6 different types of networks. 
020       The outward accessibility quantifies the potential of an individual node for accessing other nodes through random walks. The inward accessibility measures the potential of a given node of being accessed by other nodes. Both the inward and outward accessibilities are measured with respect to successive time steps along the walks, providing an interesting means for the characterization of the transient non-linear dynamics of accessibility. Self-avoiding walks are considered here because they are more purposive and necessarily finite (unlike traditional random walks). The results include the identification of the fact that the inward values tend to be much smaller than the outward values, the tendency of the inward accessibility to be highly correlated with the node degree while the outward values are mostly uncorrelated with that measurements, the distinct behavior of the accessibility in geographical networks, the dominance of hubs in scale free networks, as well as the enhanced uniformity of the accessibilities for the path-regular model. Also investigated was the possibility to predict the accessibility of a given node in terms of its respective degree. The concepts of inward and outward accessibility, as well as the several obtained results, have several implications and potential for applications to several real-time problems including disease spreading, WWW surfing, protein interaction, cortical networks and network attacks, among others.

010       Tourism networks and computer networks

020       The analysis of some of these, namely those formed by companies and institutions, however, has proved problematical mainly for the difficulties in collecting a reasonable amount of data. This contribution argues that the World Wide Web can provide an efficient and effective way to gather significant samples of networked socio-economic systems to be used for network analyses and simulations. The case discussed refers to a tourism destination, the fundamental subsystem of an industry which can be considered one of the most important in today's World economy.

010       Synchronization of Non-Linear Random Walk Dynamics in Complex Network
021       This work addresses synchronization in transient, non-linear stochastic dynamics corresponding to accesses performed by self-avoiding walks originating at each node of a complex network. 
020       More specifically, the synchronizability of accesses incoming from other nodes has been considered and quantified in terms of the entropy of the mean periods of access, being closely associated to the efficiency of access delivery to each node. The concept of synchronous support of a node $i$ has also been suggested as corresponding to the nodes which contribute the most for the synchronization of the accesses to $i$. These concepts have been applied to the analysis of 6 networks of different types, leading to markedly smaller synchronizability being obtained for the Watts-Strogatz and a geographical models. The more uniform synchronizabilities were identified for the Watts-Strogatz and path-regular structures. Varying degrees of correlations were found between the synchronizability and the degree or outward accessibility of the nodes. The synchronous support of a node $i$ has been found to present diverse structure, including nodes which may be near to $i$, or nodes which are scattered through the network and far away from $i$.

010       Synchronization in Random Geometric Graphs
021       In this paper we study the synchronization properties of random geometric graphs. 
020       We show that the onset of synchronization takes place roughly at the same value of the order parameter that a random graph with the same size and average connectivity. However, the dependence of the order parameter with the coupling strength indicates that the fully synchronized state is more easily attained in random graphs. We next focus on the complete synchronized state and show that this state is less stable for random geometric graphs than for other kinds of complex networks. Finally, a rewiring mechanism is proposed as a way to improve the stability of the fully synchronized state as well as to lower the value of the coupling strength at which it is achieved. Our work has important implications for the synchronization of wireless networks, and should provide valuable insights for the development and deployment of more efficient and robust distributed synchronization protocols for these systems.

021       The uniform recursive tree (URT) is one of the most important models and has been successfully applied to many fields. 
020       Here we study exactly the topological characteristics and spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix of a deterministic uniform recursive tree, which is a deterministic version of URT. Firstly, from the perspective of complex networks, we determine the main structural characteristics of the deterministic tree. The obtained vigorous results show that the network has an exponential degree distribution, small average path length, power-law distribution of node betweenness, and positive degree-degree correlations. Then we determine the complete Laplacian spectra (eigenvalues) and their corresponding eigenvectors of the considered graph. Interestingly, all the Laplacian eigenvalues are distinct.

010       Detecting Neuronal Communities from Beginning of Activation Patterns
021       The detection of neuronal communities is addressed with basis on two important concepts from neuroscience: facilitation of neuronal firing and nearly simultaneous beginning of activation of sets of neurons. 
020       More specifically, integrate-and-fire complex neuronal networks are activated at each of their nodes, and the dissemination of activation is monitored. As the activation received by each neuron accumulates, its firing gets facilitated. The time it takes for each neuron, other than the source, to receive the first non-zero input (beginning activation time) and the time for it to produce the first spike (beginning spiking time) are identified through simulations. It is shown, with respect to two synthetic and a real-world (\emph{C. elegans}) neuronal complex networks, that the patterns of beginning activation times (and to a lesser extent also of the spiking times) tend to cluster into groups corresponding to communities of neurons in the original complex neuronal network. Such an effect is identified to be a direct consequence of the almost simultaneous activation between the nodes inside the same community in which the source of activation is placed, as well as of the respective trapping of activation implied by the integration of activiation prior to firing. Interestingly, the accumulation of activity and thresholds inside each neuron were found to be essential for constraining the initial activations within each respective community during the transient activation (no clear clusters were observed when using overall activation or spiking rates). In addition to its intrinsic value for neuroscience and structure-dynamics studies, these results confirm the importance of the consideration of transient dynamics in complex systems investigations.

010       Communities in Neuronal Complex Networks Revealed by Activation Patterns
021       Recently, it has been shown that the communities in neuronal networks of the integrate-and-fire type can be identified by considering patterns containing the beginning times for each cell to receive the first non-zero activation. 
020       The received activity was integrated in order to facilitate the spiking of each neuron and to constrain the activation inside the communities, but no time decay of such activation was considered. The present article shows that, by taking into account exponential decays of the stored activation, it is possible to identify the communities also in terms of the patterns of activation along the initial steps of the transient dynamics. The potential of this method is illustrated with respect to complex neuronal networks involving four communities, each of a different type (Erd\H{o}s-R\'eny, Barab\'asi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz as well as a simple geographical model). Though the consideration of activation decay has been found to enhance the communities separation, too intense decays tend to yield less discrimination.

010       The Scaling laws of Spatial Structure in Social Networks
021       Social network structure is very important for understanding human information diffusing, cooperating and competing patterns. 
020       It can bring us with some deep insights about how people affect each other. As a part of complex networks, social networks have been studied extensively. Many important universal properties with which we are quite familiar have been recovered, such as scale free degree distribution, small world, community structure, self-similarity and navigability. According to some empirical investigations, we conclude that our social network also possesses another important universal property. The spatial structure of social network is scale invariable. The distribution of geographic distance between friendship is about $Pr(d)\propto d^{-1}$ which is harmonious with navigability. More importantly, from the perspective of searching information, this kind of property can benefit individuals most.

010       Avalanches of Activation and Spikes in Neuronal Complex Networks
021       As shown recently (<a href="/abs/0801.3056">arXiv:0801.3056</a>), several types of neuronal complex networks involving non-linear integration-and-fire dynamics exhibit an abrupt activation along their transient regime. 
020       Interestingly, such an avalanche of activation has also been found to depend strongly on the topology of the networks: while the Erd\H{o}s-R\'eny, Barab\'asi-Albert, path-regular and path-transformed BA models exhibit well-defined avalanches; Watts-Strogatz and geographical structures present instead a gradual dispersion of activation amongst their nodes. The current work investigates such phenomena by considering a mean-field equivalent model of a network which is strongly founded on the concepts of concentric neighborhoods and degrees. It is shown that the hierarchical number of nodes and hierarchical degrees define the intensity and timing of the avalanches. This approach also allowed the identification of the beginning activation times during the transient dynamics, which is particularly important for community identification (<a href="/abs/0801.4269">arXiv:0801.4269</a>, <a href="/abs/0801.4684">arXiv:0801.4684</a>). The main concepts and results in this work are illustrated with respect to theoretical and real-world (\emph{C. elegans}) networks. Several results are reported, including the identification of secondary avalanches, the validation of the equivalent model, the identification of the possible universality of the avalanches for most networks (depending only on the network size), as well as the identification of the fact that different avalanches can be obtained by locating the activation source at different neurons of the \emph{C. elegans} network.

010       The underlying complex network of the Minority Game
021       We study the structure of the underlying network of connections in the Minority Game. 
020       There is not an explicit interaction among the agents, but they interact via global magnitudes of the model and mainly through their strategies. We define a link between two agents by quantifying the similarity among their strategies, and analyze the structure of the resulting underlying complex networks as a function of the number of agents in the game and the value of the agents' memory, in games with two strategies per player. We characterize the different phases of this system with networks with different properties, for this link definition. Thus, the Minority Game phase characterized by the presence of crowds can be identified with a small world network, while the phase with the same results as a random decision game as a random network. Finally, we use the Full Strategy Minority Game model, to explicitly calculate some properties of its networks, such as the degree distribution, for the same link definition, and to estimate, from them, the properties of the networks of the Minority Game, obtaining a very good agreement with its measured properties.

010       Stabilizing and Destabilizing Effects of Embedding 3-node Subgraphs on   State Space of Boolean Networks
021       We demonstrate the effects of embedding subgraphs using a Boolean network, which is one of the discrete dynamical models for transcriptional regulatory networks. 
020       After comparing the dynamical properties of network embedded seven different subgraphs including feedback and feedforward subgraphs, we found that complexity of the state space that increases with longer length of attractors and greater number of attractors is reduced for networks with more feedforward subgraphs. In addition, feedforward subgraphs can also provide higher mutual information with lower entropy in a temporal program of gene expression. Networks with other six subgraphs show opposite effects on dynamics of the networks, is roughly consistent with Thomas's conjecture. These results suggest that feedforward subgraphs are one of the favorable local structures in biological complex networks.

010       Detecting the overlapping and hierarchical community structure of   complex networks
021       Many networks in nature, society and technology are characterized by a mesoscopic level of organization, with groups of nodes forming tightly connected units, called communities or modules, that are only weakly linked to each other. 
020       Uncovering this community structure is one of the most important problems in the field of complex networks. Networks often show a hierarchical organization, with communities embedded within other communities; moreover, nodes can be shared between different communities. Here we present the first algorithm that finds both overlapping communities and the hierarchical structure. The method is based on the local optimization of a fitness function. Community structure is revealed by peaks in the fitness histogram. The resolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling to investigate different hierarchical levels of organization. Tests on real and artificial networks give excellent results.

010       Adaptive synchronization of dynamics on evolving complex networks
021       We study the problem of synchronizing a general complex network by means of an adaptive strategy in the case where the network topology is slowly time varying and every node receives at each time only one aggregate signal from the set of its neighbors. 
020       We introduce an appropriately defined potential that each node seeks to minimize in order to reach/maintain synchronization. We show that our strategy is effective in tracking synchronization as well as in achieving synchronization when appropriate conditions are met.

010       Activation Confinement Inside Complex Networks Communities
021       In this work it is described how to enhance and generalize the equivalent model (<a href="/abs/0802.0421">arXiv:0802.0421</a>) of integrate-and-fire dynamics in order to treat any complex neuronal networks, especially those exibiting modular structure. 
020       It has been shown that, though involving only a handful of equivalent neurons, the modular equivalent model was capable of providing impressive predictions about the non-linear integrate-and-fire dynamics in two hybrid modular networks. The reported approach has also allowed the identification of the causes of transient spiking confinement within the network communities, which correspond to the fact that the little activation sent from the source community to the others implies in long times for reaching the nearly-simultaneous activation of the concentric levels at the other communities and respective avalanches. Several other insights are reported in this work, including the smoothing of the spiking functions, the consideration of intra-ring connections and its effects, as well as the identification of how the weights in the equivalent model change for different source nodes. This work has paved the way for a number of promising developments, which are identified and discussed. Preliminary results are also described which reveal waves induced by the integrate-and-fire dynamics along the steady-state regime.

010       Spectral Measure of Robustness in Complex Networks
021       We introduce the concept of natural connectivity as a robustness measure of complex networks. 
020       The natural connectivity has a clear physical meaning and a simple mathematical formulation. It characterizes the redundancy of alternative paths by quantifying the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths. We show that the natural connectivity can be derived mathematically from the graph spectrum as an average eigenvalue and that it increases strictly monotonically with the addition of edges. We test the natural connectivity and compare it with other robustness measures within a scenario of edge elimination. We demonstrate that the natural connectivity has an acute discrimination which agrees with our intuition.

010       Percolation transition in correlated static model
021       We introduce a correlated static model and investigate a percolation transition. 
020       The model is a modification of the static model and is characterized by assortative degree-degree correlation. As one varies the edge density, the network undergoes a percolation transition. The percolation transition is characterized by a weak singular behavior of the mean cluster size and power-law scalings of the percolation order parameter and the cluster size distribution in the entire non-percolating phase. These results suggest that the assortative degree-degree correlation generates a global structural correlation which is relevant to the percolation critical phenomena of complex networks.

010       Diversity of reproduction rate supports cooperation in the prisoner's   dilemma game on complex networks
021       In human societies the probability of strategy adoption from a given person may be affected by the personal features. 
020       Now we investigate how an artificially imposed restricted ability to reproduce, overruling ones fitness, affects an evolutionary process. For this purpose we employ the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game on different complex graphs. Reproduction restrictions can have a facilitative effect on the evolution of cooperation that sets in irrespective of particularities of the interaction network. Indeed, an appropriate fraction of less fertile individuals may lead to full supremacy of cooperators where otherwise defection would be widespread. By studying cooperation levels within the group of individuals having full reproduction capabilities, we reveal that the recent mechanism for the promotion of cooperation is conceptually similar to the one reported previously for scale-free networks. Our results suggest that the diversity in the reproduction capability, related to inherently different attitudes of individuals, can enforce the emergence of cooperative behavior among selfish competitors.

010       Rich-club vs rich-multipolarization phenomena in weighted networks
021       Large scale hierarchies characterize complex networks in different domains. 
020       Elements at their top, usually the most central or influential, may show multipolarization or tend to club forming tightly interconnected communities. The rich-club phenomenon quantified this tendency based on unweighted network representations. Here, we define this metric for weighted networks and discuss the appropriate normalization which preserves nodes' strengths and discounts structural strength-strength correlations if present. We find that in some real networks the results given by the weighted rich-club coefficient can be in sharp contrast to the ones in the unweighted approach. We also discuss that the scanning of the weighted subgraphs formed by the high-strength hubs is able to unveil features contrary to the average: the formation of local alliances in rich-multipolarized environments, or a lack of cohesion even in the presence of rich-club ordering. Beyond structure, this analysis matters for understanding correctly functionalities and dynamical processes relying on hub interconnectedness.

010       Use of Rapid Probabilistic Argumentation for Ranking on Large Complex   Networks
021       We introduce a family of novel ranking algorithms called ERank which run in linear/near linear time and build on explicitly modeling a network as uncertain evidence. 
020       The model uses Probabilistic Argumentation Systems (PAS) which are a combination of probability theory and propositional logic, and also a special case of Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. ERank rapidly generates approximate results for the NP-complete problem involved enabling the use of the technique in large networks. We use a previously introduced PAS model for citation networks generalizing it for all networks. We propose a statistical test to be used for comparing the performances of different ranking algorithms based on a clustering validity test. Our experimentation using this test on a real-world network shows ERank to have the best performance in comparison to well-known algorithms including PageRank, closeness, and betweenness.

010       Bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on scale-free networks
021       Reaction-diffusion processes can be adopted to model a large number of dynamics on complex networks, such as transport processes or epidemic outbreaks. 
020       In most cases, however, they have been studied from a fermionic perspective, in which each vertex can be occupied by at most one particle. While still useful, this approach suffers from some drawbacks, the most important probably being the difficulty to implement reactions involving more than two particles simultaneously. Here we introduce a general framework for the study of bosonic reaction-diffusion processes on complex networks, in which there is no restriction on the number of interacting particles that a vertex can host. We describe these processes theoretically by means of continuous time heterogeneous mean-field theory and divide them into two main classes: steady state and monotonously decaying processes. We analyze specific examples of both behaviors within the class of one-species process, comparing the results (whenever possible) with the corresponding fermionic counterparts. We find that the time evolution and critical properties of the particle density are independent of the fermionic or bosonic nature of the process, while differences exist in the functional form of the density of occupied vertices in a given degree class k. We implement a continuous time Monte Carlo algorithm, well suited for general bosonic simulations, which allow us to confirm the analytical predictions formulated within mean-field theory. Our results, both at the theoretical and numerical level, can be easily generalized to tackle more complex, multi-species, reaction-diffusion processes, and open a promising path for a general study and classification of this kind of dynamical systems on complex networks.

010       Local Information Based Algorithms for Packet Transport in Complex   Networks
021       We introduce four algorithms for packet transport in complex networks. 
020       These algorithms use deterministic rules which depend, in different ways, on the degree of the node, the number of packets posted down each edge, the mean delivery time of packets sent down each edge to each destination and the time since an edge last transmitted a packet. On scale-free networks all our algorithms are considerably more efficient and can handle a larger load than the random walk algorithm. We consider in detail various attributes of our algorithms, for instance we show that an algorithm that bases its decisions on the mean delivery time jams unless it incorporates information about the degree of the destination node.

The transition probabilities are estimated for several lengths of the walks and used to calculate the outward accessibility of each node. The potential of the methodology is illustrated with respect to the characterization and improvements of the accessibility of the town of Sao Carlos.

010       Reversibility, Water-Mediated Switching, and Directed Cell Dynamics
021       Reversible switching of the complex network dynamics of proteins is mimicked in selected network glasses and compacted small carbohydrate molecules. 
020       Protein transitions occur on long time scales ~ us -ms, evocative of the exponentially large viscosities found in glass-forming supercooled liquids just above the glass transition; in searching for mechanisms for reversibly slowed "geared activation", Kauzmann was led from proteins to glasses. I show here that selected network glasses and small carbohydrate molecules can be used to model such transitions, and elucidate in particular some universal aspects of tandem repeats. The human ankyrin tandem repeat D34, with a superhelical "coiled spring" structure which has 426 residues, folds reversibly and plastically. Such molecules are too large for present transition-state numerical simulations, currently limited to ~ 100 residues solvated by ~ 3000 water molecules for times ~ ns. The transition states of D34 exhibit a surprisingly simple collective ("geared") pattern when studied by fluorescence near its center, in samples modified mutageneously along its 12 helical repeats. One can understand this "plastic" pattern by taking advantage of a symmetric 45-atom carbohydrate molecular bridge to "cross over" from proteins to inorganic network glasses. There one easily identifies gears, and can show that the collective pattern is the signature of nonlocal, water-mediated [hydro(phobic/philic)] switching. Details of the transition patterns emerge from analyzing the amino acid alpha helical repeat sequences with water-only hydrophobicity scales. Freezing and melting of monolayer water films at physiological temperatures can enable ankyrin repeats to direct cell dynamics in muscles, membranes and cytoskeletons.

021       We propose a model of random diffusion to investigate flow fluctuations in complex networks. 
020       We derive an analytical law showing that the dependence of fluctuations with the mean traffic in a network is ruled by the delicate interplay of three factors, respectively of dynamical, topological and statistical nature. In particular, we demonstrate that the existence of a power-law scaling characterizing the flow fluctuations at every node in the network can not be claimed for. We show the validity of this scaling breakdown under quite general topological and dynamical situations by means of different traffic algorithms and by analyzing real data.

020       Adopting a static model introduced by Goh, Kahng and Kim, we analyse the spectral density of complex scale free networks. For that purpose, we utilize the replica method and effective medium approximation (EMA) in statistical mechanics. As a result, we identify a new integral equation which determines the asymptotic spectral density of scale free networks with a finite mean degree $p$. In the limit $p \to \infty$, known asymptotic formulae are rederived. Moreover, the $1/p$ corrections to known results are analytically calculated by a perturbative method.

010       Complex cooperative networks from evolutionary preferential attachment
021       In spite of its relevance to the origin of complex networks, the interplay between form and function and its role during network formation remains largely unexplored. 
020       While recent studies introduce dynamics by considering rewiring processes of a pre-existent network, we study network growth and formation by proposing an evolutionary preferential attachment model, its main feature being that the capacity of a node to attract new links depends on a dynamical variable governed in turn by the node interactions. As a specific example, we focus on the problem of the emergence of cooperation by analyzing the formation of a social network with interactions given by the Prisoner's Dilemma. The resulting networks show many features of real systems, such as scale-free degree distributions, cooperative behavior and hierarchical clustering. Interestingly, results such as the cooperators being located mostly on nodes of intermediate degree are very different from the observations of cooperative behavior on static networks. The evolutionary preferential attachment mechanism points to an evolutionary origin of scale-free networks and may help understand similar feedback problems in the dynamics of complex networks by appropriately choosing the game describing the interaction of nodes.

010       The Web of Connections between Tourism Companies in Elba: Structure and   Dynamics
021       Tourism destination networks are amongst the most complex dynamical systems, involving a myriad of human-made and natural resources. 
020       In this work we report a complex network-based systematic analysis of the Elba (Italy) tourism destination network, including the characterization of its structure in terms of a set of several traditional measurements, the investigation of its modularity, as well as its comprehensive study in terms of the recently reported superedges approach. In particular, structural (the number of paths of distinct lengths between pairs of nodes, as well as the number of reachable companies) and dynamical features (transition probabilities and the inward/outward activations and accessibilities) are measured and analyzed, leading to a series of important findings related to the interactions between tourism companies. Among the several reported results, it is shown that the type and size of the companies influence strongly their respective activations and accessibilities, while their geographical position does not seem to matter. It is also shown that the Elba tourism network is largely fragmented and heterogeneous, so that it could benefit from increased integration.

010       Public transport networks: empirical analysis and modeling
021       We use complex network concepts to analyze statistical properties of urban public transport networks (PTN). 
020       To this end, we present a comprehensive survey of the statistical properties of PTNs based on the data of fourteen cities of so far unexplored network size. Especially helpful in our analysis are different network representations. Within a comprehensive approach we calculate PTN characteristics in all of these representations and perform a comparative analysis. The standard network characteristics obtained in this way often correspond to features that are of practical importance to a passenger using public traffic in a given city. Specific features are addressed that are unique to PTNs and networks with similar transport functions (such as networks of neurons, cables, pipes, vessels embedded in 2D or 3D space). Based on the empirical survey, we propose a model that albeit being simple enough is capable of reproducing many of the identified PTN properties. A central ingredient of this model is a growth dynamics in terms of routes represented by self-avoiding walks.

010       Complex networks renormalization: flows and fixed points
021       Recently, it has been claimed that some complex networks are self-similar under a convenient renormalization procedure. 
020       We present a general method to study renormalization flows in graphs. We find that the behavior of some variables under renormalization, such as the maximum number of connections of a node, obeys simple scaling laws, characterized by critical exponents. This is true for any class of graphs, from random to scale-free networks, from lattices to hierarchical graphs. Therefore, renormalization flows for graphs are similar as in the renormalization of spin systems. An analysis of classic renormalization for percolation and the Ising model on the lattice confirms this analogy. Critical exponents and scaling functions can be used to classify graphs in universality classes, and to uncover similarities between graphs that are inaccessible to a standard analysis.

010       Condensation phenomena of conserved-mass aggregation model on weighted   complex networks
021       We investigate the condensation phase transitions of conserved-mass aggregation (CA) model on weighted scale-free networks (WSFNs). 
020       In WSFNs, the weight $w_{ij}$ is assigned to the link between the nodes $i$ and $j$. We consider the symmetric weight given as $w_{ij}=(k_i k_j)^\alpha$. In CA model, the mass $m_i$ on the randomly chosen node $i$ diffuses to a linked neighbor of $i$,$j$, with the rate $T_{ji}$ or an unit mass chips off from the node $i$ to $j$ with the rate $\omega T_{ji}$. The hopping probability $T_{ji}$ is given as $T_{ji}= w_{ji}/\sum_{&lt;l&gt;} w_{li}$, where the sum runs over the linked neighbors of the node $i$. On the WSFNs, we numerically show that a certain critical $\alpha_c$ exists below which CA model undergoes the same type of the condensation transitions as those of CA model on regular lattices. However for $\alpha \geq \alpha_c$, the condensation always occurs for any density $\rho$ and $\omega$. We analytically find $\alpha_c = (\gamma-3)/2$ on the WSFN with the degree exponent $\gamma$. To obtain $\alpha_c$, we analytically derive the scaling behavior of the stationary distribution $P^{\infty}_k$ of finding a walker at nodes with degree $k$, and the probability $D(k)$ of finding two walkers simultaneously at the same node with degree $k$. We find $P^{\infty}_k \sim k^{\alpha+1-\gamma}$ and $D(k) \sim k^{2(\alpha+1)-\gamma}$ respectively. With $P^{\infty}_k$, we also show analytically and numerically that the average mass $m(k)$ on a node with degree $k$ scales as $k^{\alpha+1}$ without any jumps at the maximal degree of the network for any $\rho$ as in the SFNs with $\alpha=0$.

010       Self-affine Fractals Embedded in Spectra of Complex Networks
021       The scaling properties of spectra of real world complex networks are studied by using the wavelet transform. 
020       It is found that the spectra of networks are multifractal. According to the values of the long-range correlation exponent, the Hust exponent $H$, the networks can be classified into three types, namely, $H&gt;0.5$, $H=0.5$ and $H&lt;0.5$. All real world networks considered belong to the class of $H \ge 0.5$, which may be explained by the hierarchical properties.

010       From Network Structure to Dynamics and Back Again: Relating dynamical   stability and connection topology in biological complex systems
021       The recent discovery of universal principles underlying many complex networks occurring across a wide range of length scales in the biological world has spurred physicists in trying to understand such features using techniques from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics. 
020       In this paper, we look at a few examples of biological networks to see how similar questions can come up in very different contexts. We review some of our recent work that looks at how network structure (e.g., its connection topology) can dictate the nature of its dynamics, and conversely, how dynamical considerations constrain the network structure. We also see how networks occurring in nature can evolve to modular configurations as a result of simultaneously trying to satisfy multiple structural and dynamical constraints. The resulting optimal networks possess hubs and have heterogeneous degree distribution similar to those seen in biological systems.

010       Sensitivity of complex networks measurements
021       Complex networks obtained from the real-world networks are often characterized by incompleteness and noise, consequences of limited sampling as well as artifacts in the acquisition process. 
020       Because the characterization, analysis and modeling of complex systems underlain by complex networks are critically affected by the quality of the respective initial structures, it becomes imperative to devise methodologies for identifying and quantifying the effect of such sampling problems on the characterization of complex networks. Given that several measurements need to be applied in order to achieve a comprehensive characterization of complex networks, it is important to investigate the effect of incompleteness and noise on such quantifications. In this article we report such a study, involving 8 different measurements applied on 6 different complex networks models. We evaluate the sensitiveness of the measurements to perturbations in the topology of the network considering the relative entropy. Three particularly important types of progressive perturbations to the network are considered: edge suppression, addition and rewiring. The conclusions have important practical consequences including the fact that scale-free structures are more robust to perturbations. The measurements allowing the best balance of stability (smaller sensitivity to perturbations) and discriminability (separation between different network topologies) were also identified.

010       A generalized voter model on complex networks
021       We study a generalization of the voter model on complex networks, focusing on the scaling of mean exit time. 
020       Previous work has defined the voter model in terms of an initially chosen node and a randomly chosen neighbor, which makes it difficult to disentangle the effects of the stochastic process itself relative to the network structure. We introduce a process with two steps, one that selects a pair of interacting nodes and one that determines the direction of interaction as a function of the degrees of the two nodes and a parameter $\alpha$ which sets the likelihood of the higher degree node giving its state. Traditional voter model behavior can be recovered within the model. We find that on a complete bipartite network, the traditional voter model is the fastest process. On a random network with power law degree distribution, we observe two regimes. For modest values of $\alpha$, exit time is dominated by diffusive drift of the system state, but as the high nodes become more influential, the exit time becomes becomes dominated by frustration effects. For certain selection processes, a short intermediate regime occurs where exit occurs after exponential mixing.

010       Self-organized Natural Roads for Predicting Traffic Flow: A Sensitivity   Study
021       In this paper, we extended road-based topological analysis to both nationwide and urban road networks, and concentrated on a sensitivity study with respect to the formation of self-organized natural roads based on the Gestalt principle of good continuity. 
020       Both Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) and Global Positioning System (GPS) data were used to correlate with a series of ranking metrics including five centrality-based metrics and two PageRank metrics. It was found that there exists a tipping point from segment-based to road-based network topology in terms of correlation between ranking metrics and their traffic. To our big surprise, (1) this correlation is significantly improved if a selfish rather than utopian strategy is adopted in forming the self-organized natural roads, and (2) point-based metrics assigned by summation into individual roads tend to have a much better correlation with traffic flow than line-based metrics. These counter-intuitive surprising findings constitute emergent properties of self-organized natural roads, which are intelligent enough for predicting traffic flow, thus shedding substantial insights into the understanding of road networks and their traffic from the perspective of complex networks. <br />Keywords: topological analysis, traffic flow, phase transition, small world, scale free, tipping point

010       Dynamics of condensation in growing complex networks
021       A condensation transition was predicted for growing technological networks evolving by preferential attachment and competing quality of their nodes, as described by the fitness model. 
020       <br />When this condensation occurs a node acquires a finite fraction of all the links of the network. Earlier studies based on steady state degree distribution and on the mapping to Bose-Einstein condensation, were able to identify the critical point. Here we characterize the dynamics of condensation and we present evidence that below the condensation temperature there is a slow down of the dynamics and that a single node (not necessarily the best node in the network) emerges as the winner for very long times. The characteristic time t* at which this phenomenon occurs diverges both at the critical point and at $T -&gt; 0$ when new links are attached deterministically to the highest quality node of the network.

010       Fractal Boundaries of Complex Networks
021       We introduce the concept of boundaries of a complex network as the set of nodes at distance larger than the mean distance from a given node in the network. 
020       We study the statistical properties of the boundaries nodes of complex networks. We find that for both Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and scale-free model networks, as well as for several real networks, the boundaries have fractal properties. In particular, the number of boundaries nodes {\it B} follows a power-law probability density function which scales as $B^{-2}$. The clusters formed by the boundary nodes are fractals with a fractal dimension $d_{f} \approx 2$. We present analytical and numerical evidence supporting these results for a broad class of networks. Our findings imply potential applications for epidemic spreading.

010       Structural properties of spatially embedded networks
021       We study the effects of spatial constraints on the structural properties of networks embedded in one or two dimensional space. 
020       When nodes are embedded in space, they have a well defined Euclidean distance $r$ between any pair. We assume that nodes at distance $r$ have a link with probability $p(r) \sim r^{- \delta}$. We study the mean topological distance $l$ and the clustering coefficient $C$ of these networks and find that they both exhibit phase transitions for some critical value of the control parameter $\delta$ depending on the dimensionality $d$ of the embedding space. We have identified three regimes. When $\delta &lt;d$, the networks are not affected at all by the spatial constraints. They are ``small-worlds'' $l\sim \log N$ with zero clustering at the thermodynamic limit. In the intermediate regime $d&lt;\delta&lt;2d$, the networks are affected by the space and the distance increases and becomes a power of $\log N$, and have non-zero clustering. When $\delta&gt;2d$ the networks are ``large'' worlds $l \sim N^{1/d}$ with high clustering. Our results indicate that spatial constrains have a significant impact on the network properties, a fact that should be taken into account when modeling complex networks.

010       Dynamics-Driven Evolution to Structural Heterogeneity in Complex   Networks
021       The mutual influence of dynamics and structure is a central issue in complex systems. 
020       In this paper we study by simulation slow evolution of network under the feedback of a local-majority-rule opinion process. If performance-enhancing local mutations have higher chances of getting integrated into its structure, the system can evolve into a highly heterogeneous small-world with a global hub (whose connectivity is proportional to the network size), strong local connection correlations and power law-like degree distribution. Networks with better dynamical performance are achieved if structural evolution occurs much slower than the network dynamics. Structural heterogeneity of many biological and social dynamical systems may also be driven by various dynamics-structure coupling mechanisms.

010       Overlapping Community Detection in Bipartite Networks
021       Recent researches have discovered that rich interactions among entities in nature and society bring about complex networks with community structures. 
020       Although the investigation of the community structures has promoted the development of many successful algorithms, most of them only find separated communities, while for the vast majority of real-world networks, communities actually overlap to some extent. Moreover, the vertices of networks can often belong to different domains as well. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm BiTector Bi-community De-tector) to efficiently mine overlapping communities in large-scale sparse bipartite networks. It only depends on the network topology, and does not require any priori knowledge about the number or the original partition of the network. We apply the algorithm to real-world data from different domains, showing that BiTector can successfully identifies the overlapping community structures of the bipartite networks.

010       Sequence Nets
021       We study a new class of networks, generated by sequences of letters taken from a finite alphabet consisting of $m$ letters (corresponding to $m$ types of nodes) and a fixed set of connectivity rules. 
020       Recently, it was shown how a binary alphabet might generate threshold nets in a similar fashion [Hagberg et al., Phys. Rev. E 74, 056116 (2006)]. Just like threshold nets, sequence nets in general possess a modular structure reminiscent of everyday life nets, and are easy to handle analytically (i.e., calculate degree distribution, shortest paths, betweenness centrality, etc.). Exploiting symmetry, we make a full classification of two- and three-letter sequence nets, discovering two new classes of two-letter sequence nets. The new sequence nets retain many of the desirable analytical properties of threshold nets while yielding richer possibilities for the modeling of everyday life complex networks more faithfully.

010       Adaptive networks of trading agents
021       Multi-agent models have been used in many contexts to study generic collective behavior. 
020       Similarly, complex networks have become very popular because of the diversity of growth rules giving rise to scale-free behavior. Here we study adaptive networks where the agents trade ``wealth'' when they are linked together while links can appear and disappear according to the wealth of the corresponding agents; thus the agents influence the network dynamics and vice-versa. Our framework generalizes a multi-agent model of Bouchand and Mezard, and leads to a steady state with fluctuating connectivities. The system spontaneously self-organizes into a critical state where the wealth distribution has a fat tail and the network is scale-free; in addition, network heterogeneities lead to enhanced wealth condensation.

010       A Self-organized model for network evolution
021       Here we provide a detailed analysis, along with some extensions and additonal investigations, of a recently proposed self-organised model for the evolution of complex networks. 
020       Vertices of the network are characterised by a fitness variable evolving through an extremal dynamics process, as in the Bak-Sneppen model representing a prototype of Self-Organized Criticality. The network topology is in turn shaped by the fitness variable itself, as in the fitness network model. The system self-organizes to a nontrivial state, characterized by a power-law decay of dynamical and topological quantities above a critical threshold. The interplay between topology and dynamics in the system is the key ingredient leading to an unexpected behaviour of these quantities.

021       This paper reviews, classifies and compares recent models for social networks that have mainly been published within the physics-oriented complex networks literature. 
020       The models fall into two categories: those in which the addition of new links is dependent on the (typically local) network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The ERG model turns out to produce the weakest community structure.

010       Order to Disorder Transitions in Hybrid Intelligent Systems: a Hatch to   the Interactions of Nations -Governments
021       In this study, under general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent Particles Systems (MACIPS), we reproduce two new simple subsets of such intelligent complex network, namely hybrid intelligent systems, involved a few prominent intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: self organizing feature map (SOM), Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST). 
020       Over this, we show how our algorithms can be construed as a linkage of government-society interaction, where government catches various fashions of behavior: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of such society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred. Add to this, one may find an indirect mapping among financial systems and eventual market fluctuations with MACIPS.

010       Complex Network view of performance and risks on Airport Networks
021       Air transportation has been becoming a major part of transportation infrastructure worldwide. 
020       Hence the study of the Airports Networks, the backbone of air transportation, is becoming increasingly important. In complex systems domain, airport networks are modeled as graphs (networks) comprising of airports (vertices or nodes) that are linked by flight connectivities among the airports. A complex network analysis of such a model offers holistic insight about the performance and risks in such a network. We review the performance and risks of networks with the help of studies that have been done on some of the airport networks. We present various network parameters those could be potentially used as a measure of performance and risks on airport networks. We will also see how various risks, such as break down of airports, spread of diseases across the airport network could be assessed based on the network parameters. Further we review how these insights could possibly be used to shape more efficient and safer airport networks.

010       Greedy Forwarding in Scale-Free Networks Embedded in Hyperbolic Metric   Spaces
021       We show that: (i) the roughly hierarchical structure of complex networks is congruent with negatively curved geometries hidden beneath the observed topologies; (ii) the most straightforward mapping of nodes to spaces of negative curvature naturally leads to the emergence of scale-free topologies; and (iii) greedy routing on this embedding is efficient for these topologies, achieving both 100% reachability and optimal path lengths, even under dynamic network conditions.

010       A sequential algorithm for fast clique percolation
021       In complex network research clique percolation, introduced by Palla et al., is a deterministic community detection method, which allows for overlapping communities and is purely based on local topological properties of a network. 
020       Here we present a sequential clique percolation algorithm (SCP) to do fast community detection in weighted and unweighted networks, for cliques of a chosen size. This method is based on sequentially inserting the constituent links to the network and simultaneously keeping track of the emerging community structure. Unlike existing algorithms, the SCP method allows for detecting k-clique communities at multiple weight thresholds in a single run, and can simultaneously produce a dendrogram representation of hierarchical community structure. In sparse weighted networks, the SCP algorithm can also be used for implementing the weighted clique percolation method recently introduced by Farkas et al. The computational time of the SCP algorithm scales linearly with the number of k-cliques in the network. As an example, the method is applied to a product association network, revealing its nested community structure.

010       Transport in networks with multiple sources and sinks
021       We investigate the electrical current and flow (number of parallel paths) between two sets of n sources and n sinks in complex networks. 
020       We derive analytical formulas for the average current and flow as a function of n. We show that for small n, increasing n improves the total transport in the network, while for large n bottlenecks begin to form. For the case of flow, this leads to an optimal n* above which the transport is less efficient. For current, the typical decrease in the length of the connecting paths for large n compensates for the effect of the bottlenecks. We also derive an expression for the average flow as a function of n under the common limitation that transport takes place between specific pairs of sources and sinks.

010       Characterizing the Diversity of Dynamics in Complex Networks Without   Border Effects
021       The importance of structured, complex connectivity patterns found in several real-world systems is to a great extent related to their respective effects in constraining and even defining the respective dynamics. 
020       Yet, while complex networks have been comprehensively investigated along the last decade in terms of their topological measurements, relatively less attention has been focused on the characterization of the respective dynamics. Introduced recently, the diversity entropy of complex systems can provide valuable information about the respective possible unfolding of dynamics. In the case of self-avoiding random walks, the situation assumed here, the diversity measurement allows one to quantify in how many different places an agent may effectively arrive after a given number of steps from its initial activity. Because this measurement is highly affected by border effects frequently found as a consequence of network sampling, it becomes critical to devise means for sound estimation of the diversity without being affected by this type of artifacts. We describe such an algorithm and illustrate its potential with respect to the characterization of the self-avoiding random walk dynamics in two real-world networks, namely bone canals and air transportation.

010       Synchronizability of chaotic logistic maps in delayed complex networks
021       We study a network of coupled logistic maps whose interactions occur with a certain distribution of delay times. 
020       The local dynamics is chaotic in the absence of coupling and thus the network is a paradigm of a complex system. There are two regimes of synchronization, depending on the distribution of delays: when the delays are sufficiently heterogeneous the network synchronizes on a steady-state (that is unstable for the uncoupled maps); when the delays are homogeneous, it synchronizes in a time-dependent state (that is either periodic or chaotic). Using two global indicators we quantify the synchronizability on the two regimes, focusing on the roles of the network connectivity and the topology. The connectivity is measured in terms of the average number of links per node, and we consider various topologies (scale-free, small-world, star, and nearest-neighbor with and without a central hub). With weak connectivity and weak coupling strength, the network displays an irregular oscillatory dynamics that is largely independent of the topology and of the delay distribution. With heterogeneous delays, we find a threshold connectivity level below which the network does not synchronize, regardless of the network size. This minimum average number of neighbors seems to be independent of the delay distribution. We also analyze the effect of self-feedback loops and find that they have an impact on the synchronizability of small networks with large coupling strengths. The influence of feedback, enhancing or degrading synchronization, depends on the topology and on the distribution of delays.

020       The many efforts devoted to understand synchronization phenomena in natural systems take now advantage of the recent theory of complex networks. In this review, we report the advances in the comprehension of synchronization phenomena when oscillating elements are constrained to interact in a complex network topology. We also overview the new emergent features coming out from the interplay between the structure and the function of the underlying pattern of connections. Extensive numerical work as well as analytical approaches to the problem are presented. Finally, we review several applications of synchronization in complex networks to different disciplines: biological systems and neuroscience, engineering and computer science, and economy and social sciences.

010       Spectral centrality measures in complex networks
021       Complex networks are characterized by heterogeneous distributions of the degree of nodes, which produce a large diversification of the roles of the nodes within the network. 
020       Several centrality measures have been introduced to rank nodes based on their topological importance within a graph. Here we review and compare centrality measures based on spectral properties of graph matrices. We shall focus on PageRank, eigenvector centrality and the hub/authority scores of HITS. We derive simple relations between the measures and the (in)degree of the nodes, in some limits. We also compare the rankings obtained with different centrality measures.

010       How complex a complex network of equal nodes can be?
021       Positive Lyapunov exponents measure the asymptotic exponential divergence of nearby trajectories of a dynamical system. 
020       Not only they quantify how chaotic a dynamical system is, but since their sum is an upper bound for the entropy by the Ruelle inequality, they also provide a convenient way to quantify the complexity of an active network. We present numerical evidences that for a large class of active networks, the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents is bounded by the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents of the corresponding synchronization manifold, the last quantity being in principle easier to compute than the latter. This fact is a consequence of the property that for an active network considered here, the amount of information produced is more affected by the interactions between the nodes than by the topology of the network. Using the inequality described above, we explain how to predict the behavior of a large active network only knowing the information provided by an active network consisting of two coupled nodes.

010       Fluctuation-driven capacity distribution in complex networks
021       Maximizing robustness and minimizing cost are common objectives in the design of infrastructure networks. 
020       However, most infrastructure networks evolve and operate in a highly decentralized fashion, which may significantly impact the allocation of resources across the system. Here, we investigate this question by focusing on the relation between capacity and load in different types of real-world communication and transportation networks. We find strong empirical evidence that the actual capacity of the network elements tends to be similar to the maximum available capacity, if the cost is not strongly constraining. As more weight is given to the cost, however, the capacity approaches the load nonlinearly. In particular, all systems analyzed show larger unoccupied portions of the capacities on network elements subjected to smaller loads, which is in sharp contrast with the assumptions involved in (linear) models proposed in previous theoretical studies. We describe the observed behavior of the capacity-load relation as a function of the relative importance of the cost by using a model that optimizes capacities to cope with network traffic fluctuations. These results suggest that infrastructure systems have evolved under pressure to minimize local failures, but not necessarily global failures that can be caused by the spread of local damage through cascading processes.

010       Projective-anticipating, projective, and projective-lag synchronization   of time-delayed chaotic systems on random networks
021       We study projective-anticipating, projective, and projective-lag synchronization of time-delayed chaotic systems on random networks. 
020       We relax some limitations of previous work, where projective-anticipating and projective-lag synchronization can be achieved only on two coupled chaotic systems. In this paper, we can realize projective-anticipating and projective-lag synchronization on complex dynamical networks composed by a large number of interconnected components. At the same time, although previous work studied projective synchronization on complex dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes are coupled partially linear chaotic systems. In this paper, the dynamics of the nodes of the complex networks are time-delayed chaotic systems without the limitation of the partial-linearity. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, we suggest a generic method to achieve the projective-anticipating, projective, and projective-lag synchronization of time-delayed chaotic systems on random dynamical networks and find both the existence and sufficient stability conditions. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated and verified by examining specific examples using Ikeda and Mackey-Glass systems on Erdos-Renyi networks.

010       Fluctuations and Pseudo Long Range Dependence in Network Flows: A   Non-Stationary Poisson Process Model
021       In the study of complex networks (systems), the scaling phenomenon of flow fluctuations refers to a certain power-law between the mean flux (activity) $&lt;F_i&gt;$ of the $i$th node and its variance $\sigma_i$ as $\sigma_i \propto &lt; F_{i} &gt; ^{\alpha}$. 
020       Such scaling laws are found to be prevalent both in natural and man-made network systems, but our understanding of their origins still remains limited. In this paper, a non-stationary Poisson process model is proposed to give an analytical explanation of the non-universal scaling phenomenon: the exponent $\alpha$ varies between 1/2 and 1 depending on the size of sampling time window and the relative strength of the external/internal driven forces of the systems. The crossover behavior and the relation of fluctuation scaling with pseudo long range dependence are also accounted for by the model. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model can recover the multi-scaling phenomenon.

010       Modular synchronization in complex networks with a gauge Kuramoto model
021       We modify the Kuramoto model for synchronization on complex networks by introducing a gauge term that depends on the edge betweenness centrality (BC). 
020       The gauge term introduces additional phase difference between two vertices from 0 to $\pi$ as the BC on the edge between them increases from the minimum to the maximum in the network. When the network has a modular structure, the model generates the phase synchronization within each module, however, not over the entire system. Based on this feature, we can distinguish modules in complex networks, with relatively little computational time of $\mathcal{O}(NL)$, where $N$ and $L$ are the number of vertices and edges in the system, respectively. We also examine the synchronization of the modified Kuramoto model and compare it with that of the original Kuramoto model in several complex networks.

010       Modeling the Structure and Dynamics of the Consonant Inventories: A   Complex Network Approach
021       We study the self-organization of the consonant inventories through a complex network approach. 
020       We observe that the distribution of occurrence as well as cooccurrence of the consonants across languages follow a power-law behavior. The co-occurrence network of consonants exhibits a high clustering coefficient. We propose four novel synthesis models for these networks (each of which is a refinement of the earlier) so as to successively match with higher accuracy (a) the above mentioned topological properties as well as (b) the linguistic property of feature economy exhibited by the consonant inventories. We conclude by arguing that a possible interpretation of this mechanism of network growth is the process of child language acquisition. Such models essentially increase our understanding of the structure of languages that is influenced by their evolutionary dynamics and this, in turn, can be extremely useful for building future NLP applications.

020       The main parameters of this family are comparable to those of networks associated to complex systems, and therefore the graphs are of interest as mathematical models for these systems. As the clustering coefficient of the graphs is zero, this family is an explicit construction that does not match the usual characterization of hierarchical modular networks, namely that vertices have clustering values inversely proportional to their degrees.

We then briefly review some results in the field of complex networks, and some of the models that have been proposed. Finally, we present a self-organized model recently proposed by Garlaschelli et al. [Nat. Phys. 3, 813 (2007)] that couples the fitness network model defined by Caldarelli et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 258702 (2002)] with the evolution model proposed by Bak and Sneppen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 71, 4083 (1993)] as a prototype of SOC. Remarkably, we show that the results obtained for the two models separately change dramatically when they are coupled together. This indicates that self-organized networks may represent an entirely novel class of complex systems, whose properties cannot be straightforwardly understood in terms of what we have learnt so far.

010       An adaptive routing strategy for packet delivery in complex networks
021       We present an efficient routing approach for delivering packets in complex networks. 
020       On delivering a message from a node to a destination, a node forwards the message to a neighbor by estimating the waiting time along the shortest path from each of its neighbors to the destination. This projected waiting time is dynamical in nature and the path through which a message is delivered would be adapted to the distribution of messages in the network. Implementing the approach on scale-free networks, we show that the present approach performs better than the shortest-path approach and another approach that takes into account of the waiting time only at the neighboring nodes. Key features in numerical results are explained by a mean field theory. The approach has the merit that messages are distributed among the nodes according to the capabilities of the nodes in handling messages.

010       Detrended fluctuation analysis of traffic data
021       Different routing strategies may result in different behaviors of traffic on internet. 
020       We analyze the correlation of traffic data for three typical routing strategies by the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and find that the degree of correlation of the data can be divided into three regions, i.e., weak, medium, and strong correlation. The DFA scalings are constants in both the regions of weak and strong correlation but monotonously increase in the region of medium correlation. We suggest that it is better to consider the traffic on complex network as three phases, i.e., the free, buffer, and congestion phase, than just as two phases believed before, i.e., the free and congestion phase.

010       Scaling of critical connectivity of mobile ad hoc communication networks
021       In this paper, critical global connectivity of mobile ad hoc communication networks (MAHCN) is investigated. 
020       We model the two-dimensional plane on which nodes move randomly with a triangular lattice. Demanding the best communication of the network, we account the global connectivity $\eta$ as a function of occupancy $\sigma$ of sites in the lattice by mobile nodes. Critical phenomena of the connectivity for different transmission ranges $r$ are revealed by numerical simulations, and these results fit well to the analysis based on the assumption of homogeneous mixing . Scaling behavior of the connectivity is found as $\eta \sim f(R^{\beta}\sigma)$, where $R=(r-r_{0})/r_{0}$, $r_{0}$ is the length unit of the triangular lattice and $\beta$ is the scaling index in the universal function $f(x)$. The model serves as a sort of site percolation on dynamic complex networks relative to geometric distance. Moreover, near each critical $\sigma_c(r)$ corresponding to certain transmission range $r$, there exists a cut-off degree $k_c$ below which the clustering coefficient of such self-organized networks keeps a constant while the averaged nearest neighbor degree exhibits a unique linear variation with the degree k, which may be useful to the designation of real MAHCN.

010       The development of generalized synchronization on complex networks
021       In this paper, we investigate the development of generalized synchronization (GS) on typical complex networks, such as scale-free networks, small-world networks, random networks and modular networks. 
020       By adopting the auxiliary-system approach to networks, we show that GS can take place in oscillator networks with both heterogeneous and homogeneous degree distribution, regardless of whether the coupled chaotic oscillators are identical or nonidentical. For coupled identical oscillators on networks, we find that there exists a general bifurcation path from initial non-synchronization to final global complete synchronization (CS) via GS as the coupling strength is increased. For coupled nonidentical oscillators on networks, we further reveal how network topology competes with the local dynamics to dominate the development of GS on networks. Especially, we analyze how different coupling strategies affect the development of GS on complex networks. Our findings provide a further understanding for the occurrence and development of collective behavior in complex networks.

010       Communities recognition in the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem by dynamical   clustering algorithms based on different oscillators systems
021       We have recently introduced an efficient method for the detection and identification of modules in complex networks, based on the de-synchronization properties (dynamical clustering) of phase oscillators. 
020       In this paper we apply the dynamical clustering tecnique to the identification of communities of marine organisms living in the Chesapeake Bay food web. We show that our algorithm is able to perform a very reliable classification of the real communities existing in this ecosystem by using different kinds of dynamical oscillators. We compare also our results with those of other methods for the detection of community structures in complex networks.

010       Synchronization interfaces and overlapping communities in complex   networks
021       We show that a complex network of phase oscillators may display interfaces between domains (clusters) of synchronized oscillations. 
020       The emergence and dynamics of these interfaces are studied in the general framework of interacting phase oscillators composed of either dynamical domains (influenced by different forcing processes), or structural domains (modular networks). The obtained results allow to give a functional definition of overlapping structures in modular networks, and suggest a practical method to identify them. As a result, our algorithm could detect information on both single overlapping nodes and overlapping clusters.

010       The Ultimatum Game in Complex Networks
021       We address the problem of how cooperative (altruistic-like) behavior arises in natural and social systems by analyzing an ultimatum game in complex networks. 
020       Specifically, three types of players are considered: (a) empathetic, whose aspiration level and offer are equal, (b) pragmatic, who do not distinguish between the different roles and aim to obtain the same benefit, and (c) agents whose aspiration level and offer are independent. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of pure populations on different topologies using two kinds of strategic update rules. Natural selection, which relies on replicator dynamics, and Social Penalty, inspired in the Bak-Sneppen dynamics, in which players are subjected to a social selection rule penalizing not only the less fitted individuals, but also their first neighbors. We discuss the emergence of fairness in the different settings and network topologies.

010       On the rich-club effect in dense and weighted networks
021       For many complex networks present in nature only a single instance, usually of large size, is available. 
020       Any measurement made on this single instance cannot be repeated on different realizations. In order to detect significant patterns in a real--world network it is therefore crucial to compare the measured results with a null model counterpart. Here we focus on dense and weighted networks, proposing a suitable null model and studying the behaviour of the degree correlations as measured by the rich-club coefficient. Our method solves an existing problem with the randomization of dense unweighted graphs, and at the same time represents a generalization of the rich--club coefficient to weighted networks which is complementary to other recently proposed ones.

010       Reentrant phase transition in a predator-prey model
021       We numerically investigate the six-species predator-prey game in complex networks as well as in $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices with $d=1,2,..., 6$. 
020       The interaction topology of the six species contains two loops, each of which is composed of cyclically predating three species. As the mutation rate $P$ is lowered below the well-defined phase transition point, the $Z_2$ symmetry related with the interchange of the two loops is spontaneously broken, and it has been known that the system develops the defensive alliance in which three cyclically predating species defend each other against the invasion of other species. In the small-world network structure characterized by the rewiring probability $\alpha$, the phase diagram shows the reentrant behavior as $\alpha$ is varied, indicating a twofold role of the shortcuts. In $d$-dimensional regular hypercubic lattices, the system also exhibits the reentrant phase transition as $d$ is increased. We identify universality class of the phase transition and discuss the proper mean-field limit of the system.

010       The art of community detection
021       Networks in nature possess a remarkable amount of structure. 
020       Via a series of data-driven discoveries, the cutting edge of network science has recently progressed from positing that the random graphs of mathematical graph theory might accurately describe real networks to the current viewpoint that networks in nature are highly complex and structured entities. The identification of high order structures in networks unveils insights into their functional organization. Recently, Clauset, Moore, and Newman, introduced a new algorithm that identifies such heterogeneities in complex networks by utilizing the hierarchy that necessarily organizes the many levels of structure. Here, we anchor their algorithm in a general community detection framework and discuss the future of community detection.

010       Approaching the thermodynamic limit in equilibrated scale-free networks
021       We discuss how various models of scale-free complex networks approach their limiting properties when the size N of the network grows. 
020       We focus mainly on equilibrated networks and their finite-size degree distributions. Our results show that subleading corrections to the scaling of the position of the cutoff are strong even for networks of order 10^9 nodes. We observe also a logarithmic correction to the scaling for degenerated graphs when the degree distribution follows a power law k^(-3). We study also the distribution of the maximal degree and show that it may have a different scaling than the cutoff and, moreover, it approaches the thermodynamic limit much faster. We present also some results on the cutoff function and the distribution of the maximal degree in equilibrated networks.

020       Unlike the usual two-dimensional plane, this structure makes the boundary increase exponentially with the distance from the center, and hence the displacement of a classical random walker increases linearly in time. The diffusion of a quantum particle put on the heptagonal lattice is also studied in the framework of the tight-binding model Hamiltonian, and we again find the linear diffusion like the classical random walk. A comparison with diffusion on complex networks is also made.

010       Characterization of Subgraphs Relationships and Distribution in Complex   Networks
021       A network can be analyzed at different topological scales, ranging from single nodes to motifs, communities, up to the complete structure. 
020       We propose a novel intermediate-level topological analysis that considers non-overlapping subgraphs (connected components) and their interrelationships and distribution through the network. Though such subgraphs can be completely general, our methodology focuses the cases in which the nodes of these subgraphs share some special feature, such as being critical for the proper operation of the network. Our methodology of subgraph characterization involves two main aspects: (i) a distance histogram containing the distances calculated between all subgraphs, and (ii) a merging algorithm, developed to progressively merge the subgraphs until the whole network is covered. The latter procedure complements the distance histogram by taking into account the nodes lying between subgraphs, as well as the relevance of these nodes to the overall interconnectivity. Experiments were carried out using four types of network models and four instances of real-world networks, in order to illustrate how subgraph characterization can help complementing complex network-based studies.

010       Schroedinger-like PageRank equation and localization in the WWW
021       The WorldWide Web is one of the most important communication systems we use in our everyday life. 
020       Despite its central role, the growth and the development of the WWW is not controlled by any central authority. This situation has created a huge ensemble of connections whose complexity can be fruitfully described and quantified by network theory. One important application that allows to sort out the information present in these connections is given by the PageRank alghorithm. Computation of this quantity is usually made iteratively with a large use of computational time. In this paper we show that the PageRank can be expressed in terms of a wave function obeying a Schroedinger-like equation. In particular the topological disorder given by the unbalance of outgoing and ingoing links between pages, induces wave function and potential structuring. This allows to directly localize the pages with the largest score. Through this new representation we can now compute the PageRank without iterative techniques. For most of the cases of interest our method is faster than the original one. Our results also clarify the role of topology in the diffusion of information within complex networks. The whole approach opens the possibility to novel techniques inspired by quantum physics for the analysis of the WWW properties.

010       Scaling properties of complex networks: Toward Wilsonian renormalization   for complex networks
021       Nowadays, scaling methods for general large-scale complex networks have been developed. 
020       We proposed a new scaling scheme called "two-site scaling". This scheme was applied iteratively to various networks, and we observed how the degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular, networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks.

010       The Degree Distribution of Random k-Trees
021       A power law degree distribution is established for a graph evolution model based on the graph class of k-trees. 
020       This k-tree-based graph process can be viewed as an idealized model that captures some characteristics of the preferential attachment and copying mechanisms that existing evolving graph processes fail to model due to technical obstacles. The result also serves as a further cautionary note reinforcing the point of view that a power law degree distribution should not be regarded as the only important characteristic of a complex network, as has been previously argued.

010       Alternative approach to community detection in networks
021       The problem of community detection is relevant in many disciplines of science and modularity optimization is the widely accepted method for this purpose. 
020       It has recently been shown that this approach presents a resolution limit by which it is not possible to detect communities with sizes smaller than a threshold which depends on the network size. Moreover, it might happen that the communities resulting from such an approach do not satisfy the usual qualitative definition of commune, i.e., nodes in a commune are more connected among themselves than to nodes outside the commune. In this article we introduce a new method for community detection in complex networks. We define new merit factors based on the weak and strong community definitions formulated by Radicchi et al (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101, 2658-2663 (2004)) and we show that this local definitions avoid the resolution limit problem found in the modularity optimization approach.

010       Congestion phenomena on complex networks
021       We define a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks containing the most relevant features of real routing schemes, i.e. 
020       a trade--off strategy between topological-based and traffic-based routing. The resulting collective behavior, obtained analytically for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks, is physically very rich and reproduces results recently observed in traffic simulations on scale-free networks. We find that traffic control is useless in homogeneous graphs but may improves global performance in inhomogeneous networks, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space. Traffic control also introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner.

010       Trees = Networks ?!?
021       This work addresses the intrinsic relationship between trees and networks (i.e. 
020       graphs). A complete (invertible) mapping is presented which allows trees to be mapped into weighted graphs and then backmapped into the original tree without loss of information. The extension of this methodology to more general networks, including unweighted structures, is also discussed and illustrated. It is shown that the identified duality between trees and graphs underlies several key concepts and issues of current interest in complex networks, including comprehensive characterization of trees and community detection. For instance, additional information about tree structures (e.g. phylogenetic trees) can be immediately obtained by taking into account several off-the-shelf network measurements -- such as the clustering coefficient, degree correlations and betweenness centrality. At the same time, the hierarchical structure of networks, including the respective communities, becomes clear when the network is represented in terms of the respective tree. Indeed, the network-tree mapping described in this work provides a simple and yet effective means of community detection.

010       Detecting groups of similar components in complex networks
021       We study how to detect groups in a complex network each of which consists of component nodes sharing a similar connection pattern. 
020       Based on the mixture models and the exploratory analysis set up by Newman and Leicht (Newman and Leicht 2007 {\it Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA} {\bf 104} 9564), we develop an algorithm that is applicable to a network with any degree distribution. The partition of a network suggested by this algorithm also applies to its complementary network. In general, groups of similar components are not necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community partition in some situations when the involved heterogeneity effects are tuned. The extension of this algorithm to weighted networks is discussed as well.

010       Trapping in complex networks
021       We investigate the trapping problem in Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks. 
020       We calculate the evolution of the particle density $\rho(t)$ of random walkers in the presence of one or multiple traps with concentration $c$. We show using theory and simulations that in ER networks, while for short times $\rho(t) \propto \exp(-Act)$, for longer times $\rho(t)$ exhibits a more complex behavior, with explicit dependence on both the number of traps and the size of the network. In SF networks we reveal the significant impact of the trap's location: $\rho(t)$ is drastically different when a trap is placed on a random node compared to the case of the trap being on the node with the maximum connectivity. For the latter case we find $\rho(t)\propto\exp\left[-At/N^\frac{\gamma-2}{\gamma-1}\av{k}\right]$ for all $\gamma&gt;2$, where $\gamma$ is the exponent of the degree distribution $P(k)\propto k^{-\gamma}$.

010       Fractal and Transfractal Scale-Free Networks
021       Self-similarity is a property of fractal structures, a concept introduced by Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century. 
020       The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration. Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree correlations.

010       Network Motifs in Object-Oriented Software Systems
021       Nowadays, software has become a complex piece of work that may be beyond our control. 
020       Understanding how software evolves over time plays an important role in controlling software development processes. Recently, a few researchers found the quantitative evidence of structural duplication in software systems or web applications, which is similar to the evolutionary trend found in biological systems. To investigate the principles or rules of software evolution, we introduce the relevant theories and methods of complex networks into structural evolution and change of software systems. According to the results of our experiment on network motifs, we find that the stability of a motif shows positive correlation with its abundance and a motif with high Z score tends to have stable structure. These findings imply that the evolution of software systems is based on functional cloning as well as structural duplication and tends to be structurally stable. So, the work presented in this paper will be useful for the analysis of structural changes of software systems in reverse engineering.

010       Broad lifetime distributions for ordering dynamics in complex networks
021       We search for conditions under which a characteristic time scale for ordering dynamics towards either of two absorbing states in a finite complex network of interactions does not exist. 
020       With this aim, we study random networks and networks with mesoscale community structure built up from randomly connected cliques. We find that large heterogeneity at the mesoscale level of the network appears to be a sufficient mechanism for the absence of a characteristic time for the dynamics. Such heterogeneity results in dynamical metastable states that survive at any time scale.

010       Ensembles related to the rich-club coefficient for non-evolving networks
021       In complex networks the rich nodes are the subset of nodes with high degree. 
020       These well connected nodes tend to dominate the organisation of the network's structure. In non-evolving networks, a reference network has been used to detect if the connectivity between the rich nodes is due to chance or caused by an unknown mechanism. Chance is represented as a reference network obtained from an ensemble of networks. When compared with the original network the reference network discounts suggests the existence of a well connected rich club beyond structural constraints. Here we revise some of the properties of the ensemble obtained by conserving only the degree distribution and introduce two new reference networks to study the importance of the rich nodes as organisers of the network structure. The first reference network is obtained from an ensemble of networks where all the members of the ensemble have the same rich--club coefficient. The reference network obtained from the ensemble is assortative. We propose that this reference network can be used to study networks where assortativness is a fundamental property, a common case in many social networks. The second reference network is obtained from an ensemble where the members of the ensemble all have the same probability degree distribution and rich-club coefficient. The reference network obtained from this ensemble has a very similar structure to the original network. This ensemble can be used to quantify correlations between the rich nodes and pinpoint which links are the backbone of the network's structure.

010       Centrality properties of directed module members in social networks
021       Several recent studies of complex networks have suggested algorithms for locating network communities, also called modules or clusters, which are mostly defined as groups of nodes with dense internal connections. 
020       Along with the rapid development of these clustering techniques, the ability of revealing overlaps between communities has become very important as well. An efficient search technique for locating overlapping modules is provided by the Clique Percolation Method (CPM) and its extension to directed graphs, the CPMd algorithm. Here we investigate the centrality properties of directed module members in social networks obtained from e-mail exchanges and from sociometric questionnaires. Our results indicate that nodes in the overlaps between modules play a central role in the studied systems. Furthermore, the two different types of networks show interesting differences in the relation between the centrality measures and the role of the nodes in the directed modules.

010       Stability of Maximum likelihood based clustering methods: exploring the   backbone of classifications (Who is keeping you in that community?)
021       Components of complex systems are often classified according to the way they interact with each other. 
020       In graph theory such groups are known as clusters or communities. Many different techniques have been recently proposed to detect them, some of which involve inference methods using either Bayesian or Maximum Likelihood approaches. In this article, we study a statistical model designed for detecting clusters based on connection similarity. The basic assumption of the model is that the graph was generated by a certain grouping of the nodes and an Expectation Maximization algorithm is employed to infer that grouping. We show that the method admits further development to yield a stability analysis of the groupings that quantifies the extent to which each node influences its neighbors group membership. Our approach naturally allows for the identification of the key elements responsible for the grouping and their resilience to changes in the network. Given the generality of the assumptions underlying the statistical model, such nodes are likely to play special roles in the original system. We illustrate this point by analyzing several empirical networks for which further information about the properties of the nodes is available. The search and identification of stabilizing nodes constitutes thus a novel technique to characterize the relevance of nodes in complex networks.

The network topologies are introduced a simple traffic dynamics and the total connectedness is interpreted not only in the sense of topology but also in the sense of function. We define the topological robustness and the functional robustness, investigate their combined effect and compare their relative importance to each other. The results of our study provide an alternative view of the overall robustness and highlight efficient ways to improve the robustness of the network models.

010       Navigating ultrasmall worlds in ultrashort time
021       Random scale-free networks are ultrasmall worlds. 
020       The average length of the shortest paths in networks of size N scales as lnlnN. Here we show that these ultrasmall worlds can be navigated in ultrashort time. Greedy routing on scale-free networks embedded in metric spaces finds paths with the average length scaling also as lnlnN. Greedy routing uses only local information to navigate a network. Nevertheless, it finds asymptotically the shortest paths, a direct computation of which requires global topology knowledge. Our findings imply that the peculiar structure of complex networks ensures that the lack of global topological awareness has asymptotically no impact on the length of communication paths. These results have important consequences for communication systems such as the Internet, where maintaining knowledge of current topology is a major scalability bottleneck.

010       Localization properties of a tight-binding electronic model on the   Apollonian network
021       An investigation on the properties of electronic states of a tight-binding Hamiltonian on the Apollonian network is presented. 
020       This structure, which is defined based on the Apollonian packing problem, has been explored both as a complex network, and as a substrate, on the top of which physical models can defined. The Schrodinger equation of the model, which includes only nearest neighbor interactions, is written in a matrix formulation. In the uniform case, the resulting Hamiltonian is proportional to the adjacency matrix of the Apollonian network. The characterization of the electronic eigenstates is based on the properties of the spectrum, which is characterized by a very large degeneracy. The $2\pi /3$ rotation symmetry of the network and large number of equivalent sites are reflected in all eigenstates, which are classified according to their parity. Extended and localized states are identified by evaluating the participation rate. Results for other two non-uniform models on the Apollonian network are also presented. In one case, interaction is considered to be dependent of the node degree, while in the other one, random on-site energies are considered.

021       In this work we present a simple and fast computational method, the visibility algorithm, that converts a time series into a graph. 
020       The constructed graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure. Thereby, periodic series convert into regular graphs, and random series do so into random graphs. Moreover, fractal series convert into scale-free networks, enhancing the fact that power law degree distributions are related to fractality, something highly discussed recently. Some remarkable examples and analytical tools are outlined in order to test the method's reliability. Many different measures, recently developed in the complex network theory, could by means of this new approach characterize time series from a new point of view.

010       Novel scale-free small-world networks from Koch curves
021       The class of Koch fractals is one of the most interesting families of fractals, and the study of complex networks is a central issue in the scientific community. 
020       In this paper, inspired by the famous Koch fractals, we propose a mapping technique converting Koch fractals into a family of deterministic networks, called Koch networks. This novel class of networks incorporates some key properties characterizing a majority of real-life networked systems--a power-law distribution with exponent in the range between 2 and 3, a high clustering coefficient, small average path length, and degree correlations. All these features are obtained exactly according to the proposed generation algorithm of the networks considered. The network representation approach could be used to investigate the complexity of some real-world systems from the perspective of complex networks, and our networks may describe various real-life networked systems.

010       Power grids vulnerability: a complex network approach
021       Power grids exhibit patterns of reaction to outages similar to complex networks. 
020       Blackout sequences follow power laws, as complex systems operating near a critical point. Here, the tolerance of electric power grids to both accidental and malicious outages is analyzed in the framework of complex network theory. In particular, the quantity known as efficiency is modified by introducing a new concept of distance between nodes. As a result, a new parameter called net-ability is proposed to evaluate the performance of power grids. A comparison between efficiency and net-ability is provided by estimating the vulnerability of sample networks, in terms of both the metrics.

010       Hierarchical structure and the prediction of missing links in networks
021       Networks have in recent years emerged as an invaluable tool for describing and quantifying complex systems in many branches of science. 
020       Recent studies suggest that networks often exhibit hierarchical organization, where vertices divide into groups that further subdivide into groups of groups, and so forth over multiple scales. In many cases these groups are found to correspond to known functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in biochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, or genetic regulatory networks), or communities in social networks. Here we present a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network data and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain and quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of networks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering coefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of hierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partially known networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than competing techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a central organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight into many network phenomena.

010       Generalized theory for node disruption in finite size complex networks
021       After a failure or attack the structure of a complex network changes due to node removal. 
020       Here, we show that the degree distribution of the distorted network, under any node disturbances, can be easily computed through a simple formula. Based on this expression, we derive a general condition for the stability of non-correlated finite complex networks under any arbitrary attack. We apply this formalism to derive an expression for the percolation threshold $f_c$ under a general attack of the form $f_k \sim k^{\gamma}$, where $f_k$ stands for the probability of a node of degree $k$ of being removed during the attack. We show that $f_c$ of a finite network of size $N$ exhibits an additive correction which scales as $N^{-1}$ with respect to the classical result for infinite networks.

010       Different thresholds of bond percolation in scale-free networks with   identical degree sequence
021       Generally, the threshold of percolation in complex networks depends on the underlying structural characterization. 
020       However, what topological property plays a predominant role is still unknown, despite the speculation of some authors that degree distribution is a key ingredient. The purpose of this paper is to show that power-law degree distribution itself is not sufficient to characterize the threshold of bond percolation in scale-free networks. To achieve this goal, we first propose a family of scale-free networks with the same degree sequence and obtain by analytical or numerical means several topological features of the networks. Then, by making use of the renormalization group technique we determine the threshold of bond percolation in our networks. We find an existence of non-zero thresholds and demonstrate that these thresholds can be quite different, which implies that power-law degree distribution does not suffice to characterize the percolation threshold in scale-free networks.

010       Microdynamics in stationary complex networks
021       Many complex systems, including networks, are not static but can display strong fluctuations at various time scales. 
020       Characterizing the dynamics in complex networks is thus of the utmost importance in the understanding of these networks and of the dynamical processes taking place on them. In this article, we study the example of the US airport network in the time period 1990-2000. We show that even if the statistical distributions of most indicators are stationary, an intense activity takes place at the local (`microscopic') level, with many disappearing/appearing connections (links) between airports. We find that connections have a very broad distribution of lifetimes, and we introduce a set of metrics to characterize the links' dynamics. We observe in particular that the links which disappear have essentially the same properties as the ones which appear, and that links which connect airports with very different traffic are very volatile. Motivated by this empirical study, we propose a model of dynamical networks, inspired from previous studies on firm growth, which reproduces most of the empirical observations both for the stationary statistical distributions and for the dynamical properties.

010       Persistent Homology of Complex Networks
021       Long lived topological features are distinguished from short lived ones (considered as topological noise) in simplicial complexes constructed from complex networks. 
020       A new topological invariant, persistent homology, is determined and presented as a parametrized version of a Betti number. Complex networks with distinct degree distributions exhibit distinct persistent topological features. Persistent toplogical attributes, shown to be related to robust quality of networks, also reflect defficiency in certain connectivity properites of networks. Random networks, networks with exponential conectivity distribution and scale-free networks were considered for homological persistency analysis.

010       Boolean modeling of collective effects in complex networks
021       Complex systems are often modeled as Boolean networks in attempts to capture their logical structure and reveal its dynamical consequences. 
020       Approximating the dynamics of continuous variables by discrete values and Boolean logic gates may, however, introduce dynamical possibilities that are not accessible to the original system. We show that large random networks of variables coupled through continuous transfer functions often fail to exhibit the complex dynamics of corresponding Boolean models in the disordered (chaotic) regime, even when each individual function appears to be a good candidate for Boolean idealization. A suitably modified Boolean theory explains the behavior of systems in which information does not propagate faithfully down certain chains of nodes. Model networks incorporating calculated or directly measured transfer functions reported in the literature on transcriptional regulation of genes are described by the modified theory.

010       Jamming transition in traffic flow under the priority queuing protocol
021       Packet traffic in complex networks undergoes the jamming transition from free-flow to congested state as the number of packets in the system increases. 
020       Here we study such jamming transition when queues are operated by the priority queuing protocol and packets are guided by the dynamic routing protocol. We introduce a minimal model in which there are two types of packets distinguished by whether priority is assigned. Based on numerical simulations, we show that traffic is improved in the congested region under the priority queuing protocol, and it is worsened in the free-flow region. Also, we find that at the transition point, the waiting-time distribution follows a power law, and the power spectrum of traffic exhibits a crossover between two 1/f^a behaviors with exponent a ~ 1 and 1 &lt; a &lt; 2 in low and high frequency regime, respectively. This crossover is originated from a characteristic waiting time of packets in the queue.

010       Community detection in networks with positive and negative links
021       Detecting communities in complex networks accurately is a prime challenge, preceding further analyses of network characteristics and dynamics. 
020       Until now, community detection took into account only positively valued links, while many actual networks also feature negative links. We extend an existing Potts model to incorporate negative links as well, resulting in a method similar to the clustering of signed graphs, as dealt with in social balance theory, but more general. To illustrate our method, we applied it to a network of international alliances and disputes. Using data from 1993--2001, it turns out that the world can be divided into six power blocs similar to Huntington's civilizations, with some notable exceptions.

010       Renormalization flows in complex networks
021       Complex networks have acquired a great popularity in recent years, since the graph representation of many natural, social and technological systems is often very helpful to characterize and model their phenomenology. 
020       Additionally, the mathematical tools of statistical physics have proven to be particularly suitable for studying and understanding complex networks. Nevertheless, an important obstacle to this theoretical approach is still represented by the difficulties to draw parallelisms between network science and more traditional aspects of statistical physics. In this paper, we explore the relation between complex networks and a well known topic of statistical physics: renormalization. A general method to analyze renormalization flows of complex networks is introduced. The method can be applied to study any suitable renormalization transformation. Finite-size scaling can be performed on computer-generated networks in order to classify them in universality classes. We also present applications of the method on real networks.

010       Characterizing the Robustness of Complex Networks
021       With increasingly ambitious initiatives such as GENI and FIND that seek to design the future Internet, it becomes imperative to define the characteristics of robust topologies, and build future networks optimized for robustness. 
020       This paper investigates the characteristics of network topologies that maintain a high level of throughput in spite of multiple attacks. To this end, we select network topologies belonging to the main network models and some real world networks. We consider three types of attacks: removal of random nodes, high degree nodes, and high betweenness nodes. We use elasticity as our robustness measure and, through our analysis, illustrate that different topologies can have different degrees of robustness. In particular, elasticity can fall as low as 0.8% of the upper bound based on the attack employed. This result substantiates the need for optimized network topology design. Furthermore, we implement a tradeoff function that combines elasticity under the three attack strategies and considers the cost of the network. Our extensive simulations show that, for a given network density, regular and semi-regular topologies can have higher degrees of robustness than heterogeneous topologies, and that link redundancy is a sufficient but not necessary condition for robustness.

010       Diffusion of Time-Varying Signals in Complex Networks: A   Structure-Dynamics Investigation Focusing the Distance to the Source of   Activation
021       The way in which different types of dynamics unfold in complex networks is intrinsically related to the propagation of activation along nodes, which is strongly affected by the network connectivity. 
020       In this work we investigate to which extent a time-varying signal emanating from a specific node is modified as it diffuses, at the equilibrium regime, along uniformly random (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi) and scale-free (Barab\'asi-Albert) networks. The degree of preservation is quantified in terms of the Pearson cross-correlation between the original signal and the derivative of the signals appearing at each node along time. Several interesting results are reported. First, the fact that quite distinct signals are typically obtained at different nodes in the considered networks implies mean-field approaches to be completely inadequate. It has also been found that the peak and lag of the similarity time-signatures obtained for each specific node are strongly related to the respective distance between that node and the source node. Such a relationship tends to decrease with the average degree of the networks. Also, in the case of the lag, a less intense relationship is verified for scale-free networks. No relationship was found between the dispersion of the similarity signature and the distance to the source.

010       Analysis of Aperture Evolution in a Rock Joint Using a Complex Network   Approach
021       In this study, we develop a complex network approach on a rough fracture, where evolution of elementary aperture during translational shear is characterized. 
020       In this manner, based on some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles, we make evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) and on the measured apertures profiles. Evaluation of the emerged network shows the connectivity degree (distribution) of network, after a transition step; fall in to the stable states which are coincided with the Gaussian distribution. Based on this event and real observations of the complex network changes, a simple model has been proposed in which evolving (decaying) of network is accomplished using a preferential detachment of edges. This suggests that destroying of surfaces is accomplished in a manner that is followed as a combination of random and preferential selection of each element. Also, evolving of cluster coefficients and number of edges displays similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities. Distinguishing of the contact profiles (or their equivalent : percolating clusters) and their changes, despite the former case, disclosed new side of a network, namely growing networks, which shed light the details of changes within intra-topology of profiles. <br />Keywords: Complex Network, Aperture Evolution, Rock Joint

010       ELASTICITY: Topological Characterization of Robustness in Complex   Networks
021       Just as a herd of animals relies on its robust social structure to survive in the wild, similarly robustness is a crucial characteristic for the survival of a complex network under attack. 
020       The capacity to measure robustness in complex networks defines the resolve of a network to maintain functionality in the advent of classical component failures and at the onset of cryptic malicious attacks. To date, robustness metrics are deficient and unfortunately the following dilemmas exist: accurate models necessitate complex analysis while conversely, simple models lack applicability to our definition of robustness. In this paper, we define robustness and present a novel metric, elasticity- a bridge between accuracy and complexity-a link in the chain of network robustness. Additionally, we explore the performance of elasticity on Internet topologies and online social networks, and articulate results.

010       Complex Agent Networks explaining the HIV epidemic among homosexual men   in Amsterdam
021       Simulating the evolution of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic requires a detailed description of the population network, especially for small populations in which individuals can be represented in detail and accuracy. 
020       In this paper, we introduce the concept of a Complex Agent Network(CAN) to model the HIV epidemics by combining agent-based modelling and complex networks, in which agents represent individuals that have sexual interactions. The applicability of CANs is demonstrated by constructing and executing a detailed HIV epidemic model for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Amsterdam, including a distinction between steady and casual relationships. We focus on MSM contacts because they play an important role in HIV epidemics and have been tracked in Amsterdam for a long time. Our experiments show good correspondence between the historical data of the Amsterdam cohort and the simulation results.

010       Structural and spectral properties of a family of deterministic   recursive trees: Rigorous solutions
021       As one of the most significant models, the uniform recursive tree (URT) has found many applications in a variety of fields. 
020       In this paper, we study rigorously the structural features and spectral properties of the adjacency matrix for a family of deterministic uniform recursive trees (DURTs) that are deterministic versions of URT. Firstly, from the perspective of complex networks, we investigate analytically the main structural characteristics of DURTs, and obtain the accurate solutions for these properties, which include degree distribution, average path length, distribution of node betweenness, and degree correlations. Then we determine the complete eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix for DURTs. Our research may shed light in better understanding of the features for URT. Also, the analytical methods used here is capable of extending to many other deterministic networks, making the precise computation of their properties (especially the full spectrum characteristics) possible.

010       Laplacian Dynamics and Multiscale Modular Structure in Networks
021       Most methods proposed to uncover communities in complex networks rely on their structural properties. 
020       Here we introduce the stability of a network partition, a measure of its quality defined in terms of the statistical properties of a dynamical process taking place on the graph. The time-scale of the process acts as an intrinsic parameter that uncovers community structures at different resolutions. The stability extends and unifies standard notions for community detection: modularity and spectral partitioning can be seen as limiting cases of our dynamic measure. Similarly, recently proposed multi-resolution methods correspond to linearisations of the stability at short times. The connection between community detection and Laplacian dynamics enables us to establish dynamically motivated stability measures linked to distinct null models. We apply our method to find multi-scale partitions for different networks and show that the stability can be computed efficiently for large networks with extended versions of current algorithms.

010       Degree distribution of the visibility graphs mapped from fractional   Brownian motions and multifractal random walks
021       The dynamics of a complex system is usually recorded in the form of time series, which can be studied through its visibility graph from a complex network perspective. 
020       We investigate the visibility graphs extracted from fractional Brownian motions and multifractal random walks, and find that the degree distributions exhibit power-law behaviors, in which the power-law exponent $\alpha$ is a linear function of the Hurst index $H$ of the time series. We also find that the degree distribution of the visibility graph is mainly determined by the temporal correlation of the original time series with minor influence from the possible multifractal nature. As an example, we study the visibility graphs constructed from two Chinese stock market indexes and unveil that the degree distributions have power-law tails, where the tail exponents of the visibility graphs and the Hurst indexes of the indexes are close to the $\alpha\sim H$ linear relationship.

010       Chaos synchronization in networks of coupled maps with time-varying   topologies
021       Complexity of dynamical networks can arise not only from the complexity of the topological structure but also from the time evolution of the topology. 
020       In this paper, we study the synchronous motion of coupled maps in time-varying complex networks both analytically and numerically. The temporal variation is rather general and formalized as being driven by a metric dynamical system. Four network models are discussed in detail in which the interconnections between vertices vary through time randomly. These models are 1) i.i.d. sequences of random graphs with fixed wiring probability, 2) groups of graphs with random switches between the individual graphs, 3) graphs with temporary random failures of nodes, and 4) the meet-for-dinner model where the vertices are randomly grouped. We show that the temporal variation and randomness of the connection topology can enhance synchronizability in many cases; however, there are also instances where they reduce synchronizability. In analytical terms, the Hajnal diameter of the coupling matrix sequence is presented as a measure for the synchronizability of the graph topology. In topological terms, the decisive criterion for synchronization of coupled chaotic maps is that the union of the time-varying graphs contains a spanning tree.

010       A Computational Model to Disentangle Semantic Information Embedded in   Word Association Norms
021       Two well-known databases of semantic relationships between pairs of words used in psycholinguistics, feature-based and association-based, are studied as complex networks. 
020       We propose an algorithm to disentangle feature based relationships from free association semantic networks. The algorithm uses the rich topology of the free association semantic network to produce a new set of relationships between words similar to those observed in feature production norms.

010       Fundamental statistical features and self-similar properties of tagged   networks
021       We investigate the fundamental statistical features of tagged (or annotated) networks having a rich variety of attributes associated with their nodes. 
020       Tags (attributes, annotations, properties, features, etc.) provide essential information about the entity represented by a given node, thus, taking them into account represents a significant step towards a more complete description of the structure of large complex systems. Our main goal here is to uncover the relations between the statistical properties of the node tags and those of the graph topology. In order to better characterise the networks with tagged nodes, we introduce a number of new notions, including tag-assortativity (relating link probability to node similarity), and new quantities, such as node uniqueness (measuring how rarely the tags of a node occur in the network) and tag-assortativity exponent. We apply our approach to three large networks representing very different domains of complex systems. A number of the tag related quantities display analogous behaviour (e.g., the networks we studied are tag-assortative, indicating possible universal aspects of tags versus topology), while some other features, such as the distribution of the node uniqueness, show variability from network to network allowing for pin-pointing large scale specific features of real-world complex networks. We also find that for each network the topology and the tag distribution are scale invariant, and this self-similar property of the networks can be well characterised by the tag-assortativity exponent, which is specific to each system.

010       A New Clustering Algorithm Based Upon Flocking On Complex Network
021       We have proposed a model based upon flocking on a complex network, and then developed two clustering algorithms on the basis of it. 
020       In the algorithms, firstly a \textit{k}-nearest neighbor (knn) graph as a weighted and directed graph is produced among all data points in a dataset each of which is regarded as an agent who can move in space, and then a time-varying complex network is created by adding long-range links for each data point. Furthermore, each data point is not only acted by its \textit{k} nearest neighbors but also \textit{r} long-range neighbors through fields established in space by them together, so it will take a step along the direction of the vector sum of all fields. It is more important that these long-range links provides some hidden information for each data point when it moves and at the same time accelerate its speed converging to a center. As they move in space according to the proposed model, data points that belong to the same class are located at a same position gradually, whereas those that belong to different classes are away from one another. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the rates of convergence of clustering algorithms are fast enough. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

010       Stochastic model for scale-free networks with cutoffs
021       We propose and analyze a stochastic model which explains, analytically, the cutoff behavior of real scale-free networks previously modeled computationally by Amaral et al. 
020       [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 97, 11149 (2000)] and others. We present a mathematical model that can explain several existing computational scale-free network generation models. This yields a theoretical basis to understand cutoff behavior in complex networks, previously treated only with simulations using distinct models. Therefore, ours is an integrative approach that unifies the existing literature on cutoff behavior in scale-free networks. Furthermore, our mathematical model allows us to reach conclusions not hitherto possible with computational models: the ability to predict the equilibrium point of active vertices and to relate the growth of networks with the probability of aging. We also discuss how our model introduces a useful way to classify scale free behavior of complex networks.

010       Protecting infrastructure networks from cost-based attacks
021       It has been known that heterogeneous networks are vulnerable to the intentional removal of a small fraction of highly connected or loaded nodes, which implies that, to protect a network effectively, a few important nodes should be allocated with more defense resources than the others. 
020       However, if too many resources are allocated to the few important nodes, the numerous less-important nodes will be less protected, which, when attacked all together, still capable of causing a devastating damage. A natural question therefore is how to efficiently distribute the limited defense resources among the network nodes such that the network damage is minimized whatever attack strategy the attacker may take. In this paper, taking into account the factor of attack cost, we will revisit the problem of network security and search for efficient network defense against the cost-based attacks. The study shows that, for a general complex network, there will exist an optimal distribution of the defense resources, with which the network is well protected from cost-based attacks. Furthermore, it is found that the configuration of the optimal defense is dependent on the network parameters. Specifically, network that has a larger size, sparser connection and more heterogeneous structure will be more benefited from the defense optimization.

010       Strong associations between microbe phenotypes and their network   architecture
021       Understanding the dependence and interplay between architecture and function in biological networks has great relevance to disease progression, biological fabrication and biological systems in general. 
020       We propose methods to assess the association of various microbe characteristics and phenotypes with the topology of their networks. We adopt an automated approach to characterize metabolic networks of 32 microbial species using 11 topological metrics from complex networks. Clustering allows us to extract the indispensable, independent and informative metrics. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we identify relevant subgroups of these metrics and establish that they associate with microbial phenotypes surprisingly well. This work can serve as a stepping stone to cataloging biologically relevant topological properties of networks and towards better modeling of phenotypes. The methods we use can also be applied to networks from other disciplines.

010       Cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma game in Random Scale-Free Graphs
021       In this paper we study the cooperative behavior of agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game in random scale-free networks. 
020       We show that the survival of cooperation is enhanced with respect to random homogeneous graphs but, on the other hand, decreases when compared to that found in Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. We show that the latter decrease is related with the structure of cooperation. Additionally, we present a mean field approximation for studying evolutionary dynamics in networks with no degree-degree correlations and with arbitrary degree distribution. The mean field approach is similar to the one used for describing the disease spreading in complex networks, making a further compartmentalization of the strategists partition into degree-classes. We show that this kind of approximation is suitable to describe the behavior of the system for a particular set of initial conditions, such as the placement of cooperators in the higher-degree classes, while it fails to reproduce the level of cooperation observed in the numerical simulations for arbitrary initial configurations.

010       Improved community structure detection using a modified fine tuning   strategy
021       The community structure of a complex network can be determined by finding the partitioning of its nodes that maximizes modularity. 
020       Many of the proposed algorithms for doing this work by recursively bisecting the network. We show that this unduely constrains their results, leading to a bias in the size of the communities they find and limiting their effectivness. To solve this problem, we propose adding a step to the existing algorithms that does not increase the order of their computational complexity. We show that, if this step is combined with a commonly used method, the identified constraint and resulting bias are removed, and its ability to find the optimal partitioning is improved. The effectiveness of this combined algorithm is also demonstrated by using it on real-world example networks. For a number of these examples, it achieves the best results of any known algorithm.

010       A dynamic model of time-dependent complex networks
021       The characterization of the "most connected" nodes in static or slowly evolving complex networks has helped in understanding and predicting the behavior of social, biological, and technological networked systems, including their robustness against failures, vulnerability to deliberate attacks, and diffusion properties. 
020       However, recent empirical research of large dynamic networks (characterized by connections that are irregular and evolve rapidly) has demonstrated that there is little continuity in degree centrality of nodes over time, even when their degree distributions follow a power law. This unexpected dynamic centrality suggests that the connections in these systems are not driven by preferential attachment or other known mechanisms. We present a novel approach to explain real-world dynamic networks and qualitatively reproduce these dynamic centrality phenomena. This approach is based on a dynamic preferential attachment mechanism, which exhibits a sharp transition from a base pure random walk scheme.

010       Complex Aperture Networks
021       A complex network approach on a rough fracture is developed. 
020       In this manner, some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles are set up and a general evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) is constructed. Evaluation of the emerged network shows the connectivity degree (distribution) of network, after a transition step; fall in to the stable states which are coincided with the Gaussian distribution. Based on this event and real observations of the complex network changes, an algorithm (COmplex Networks on Apertures: CONA) is proposed in which evolving of a network is accomplished using preferential detachments and attachments of edges (based on a competition and game manner) while the number of nodes is fixed. Also, evolving of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities. Distinguishing of the contact profiles (or their equivalent : percolating clusters) and their changes, despite the former case, disclosed new side of a network, namely growing networks, which shed light the details of changes within intra-topology of profiles.

010       Analyzing the Degree Distribution of the One-mode Projection of an   Alphabetic Bipartite Network (\alpha-BIN)
021       This study builds upon the theoretical foundations of a special class of complex networks called the Alphabetic Bipartite Networks (\alpha-BiNs) that was introduced by us earlier in the article Europhysics Letters 79, 28001 (2007). 
020       This special class of networks is appropriate for modeling discrete combinatorial systems (DCS) where the basic building blocks are a finite set of elementary units such as codons in a DNA sequence and words in a language, while different discrete combinations of these units can give rise to a potentially infinite number of genes or sentences. In this paper, we study the network of the shared discrete combinations, which is the one-mode projection of the \alpha-BiN onto the elementary units alone. The general assumption in the literature for such an analysis is that the sizes of the discrete combinations are fixed to a constant. However, real-world DCSs present us with instances where this size varies and therefore here we relax this assumption and treat these sizes as random variables being sampled from a particular distribution. An important observation is that the size distribution actually affects the degree distribution of the alphabet nodes in the one-mode projection although it does not affect the degree distribution of these nodes in the \alpha-BiN itself. We derive approximate analytical expressions for the degree distributions assuming various distributions from which these sizes are sampled. Our analytical expressions agree quite well with the stochastic simulations. In order to further corroborate our finding, we present case studies of four real-world networks.

010       Bridge Bounding: A Local Approach for Efficient Community Discovery in   Complex Networks
021       The increasing importance of Web 2.0 applications during the last years has created significant interest in tools for analyzing and describing collective user activities and emerging phenomena within the Web. 
020       Network structures have been widely employed in this context for modeling users, web resources and relations between them. However, the amount of data produced by modern web systems results in networks that are of unprecedented size and complexity, and are thus hard to interpret. To this end, community detection methods attempt to uncover natural groupings of web objects by analyzing the topology of their containing network. There are numerous techniques adopting a global perspective to the community detection problem, i.e. they operate on the complete network structure, thus being computationally expensive and hard to apply in a streaming manner. In order to add a local perspective to the study of the problem, we present Bridge Bounding, a local methodology for community detection, which explores the local network topology around a seed node in order to identify edges that act as boundaries to the local community. The proposed method can be integrated in an efficient global community detection scheme that compares favorably to the state of the art. As a case study, we apply the method to explore the topic structure of the LYCOS iQ collaborative question/answering application by detecting communities in the networks created from the collective tagging activity of users.

021       We present a methodology to extract the backbone of complex networks based on the weight and direction of links, as well as on nontopological properties of nodes. 
020       We show how the methodology can be applied in general to networks in which mass or energy is flowing along the links. In particular, the procedure enables us to address important questions in economics, namely, how control and wealth are structured and concentrated across national markets. We report on the first cross-country investigation of ownership networks, focusing on the stock markets of 48 countries around the world. On the one hand, our analysis confirms results expected on the basis of the literature on corporate control, namely, that in Anglo-Saxon countries control tends to be dispersed among numerous shareholders. On the other hand, it also reveals that in the same countries, control is found to be highly concentrated at the global level, namely, lying in the hands of very few important shareholders. Interestingly, the exact opposite is observed for European countries. These results have previously not been reported as they are not observable without the kind of network analysis developed here.

020       In this model, the opinion of an individual is affected by those of their acquaintances, but opinion changes (analogous to spin flips in an Ising-like model) are not allowed. We focus on the influence of advertising, which is represented by external magnetic fields. The interplay and competition between temperature and fields lead to order-disorder transitions, which are found to also depend on the link density and the topology of the complex network substrate. The effects of advertising campaigns with variable duration, as well as the best cost-effective strategies to achieve consensus within different scenarios, are also discussed.

010       Stability and dynamical properties of material flow systems on random   networks
021       The theory of complex networks and of disordered systems is used to study the stability and dynamical properties of a simple model of material flow networks defined on random graphs. 
020       In particular we address instabilities that are characteristic of flow networks in economic, ecological and biological systems. Based on results from random matrix theory, we work out the phase diagram of such systems defined on extensively connected random graphs, and study in detail how the choice of control policies and the network structure affects stability. We also present results for more complex topologies of the underlying graph, focussing on finitely connected Erd\"os-R\'eyni graphs, Small-World Networks and Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks. Results indicate that variability of input-output matrix elements, and random structures of the underlying graph tend to make the system less stable, while fast price dynamics or strong responsiveness to stock accumulation promote stability.

010       Collective dynamics of social annotation
021       The enormous increase of popularity and use of the WWW has led in the recent years to important changes in the ways people communicate. 
020       An interesting example of this fact is provided by the now very popular social annotation systems, through which users annotate resources (such as web pages or digital photographs) with text keywords dubbed tags. Understanding the rich emerging structures resulting from the uncoordinated actions of users calls for an interdisciplinary effort. In particular concepts borrowed from statistical physics, such as random walks, and the complex networks framework, can effectively contribute to the mathematical modeling of social annotation systems. Here we show that the process of social annotation can be seen as a collective but uncoordinated exploration of an underlying semantic space, pictured as a graph, through a series of random walks. This modeling framework reproduces several aspects, so far unexplained, of social annotation, among which the peculiar growth of the size of the vocabulary used by the community and its complex network structure that represents an externalization of semantic structures grounded in cognition and typically hard to access.

010       Patterns of cooperation: fairness and coordination in networks of   interacting agents
021       We study the self-assembly of a complex network of cooperative interactions among rational, self-interested agents. 
020       The agents have the ability to maintain different levels of cooperation with different, self-chosen partners. Further, they continuously, selectively, and independently adapt the amount of resources allocated to each of their interactions in order to maximize their payoff. Our mathematical analysis offers an explanation for different behavioral responses described in the psychological literature. Moreover, we show analytically and numerically how a high degree of social coordination can arise from the selective interaction of agents. Nevertheless, some agents achieve privileged topological positions in the network enabling them to extract high payoffs.

010       Border Detection in Complex Networks
021       One important issue implied by the finite nature of real-world networks regards the identification of their more external (border) and internal nodes. 
020       The present work proposes a formal and objective definition of these properties, founded on the recently introduced concept of node diversity. It is shown that this feature does not exhibit any relevant correlation with several well-established complex networks measurements. A methodology for the identification of the borders of complex networks is described and illustrated with respect to theoretical (geographical and knitted networks) as well as real-world networks (urban and word association networks), yielding interesting results and insights in both cases.

010       Phase-Space Networks of Geometrical Frustrated Systems
021       Geometric frustration leads to complex phases of matter with exotic properties. 
020       Antiferromagnets on triangular lattices and square ice are two simple models of geometrical frustration. We map their highly degenerated ground-state phase spaces as discrete networks such that network analysis tools can be introduced to phase-space studies. The resulting phase spaces establish a novel class of complex networks with Gaussian spectral densities. Although phase-space networks are heterogeneously connected, the systems are still ergodic except under periodic boundary conditions. We elucidate the boundary effects by mapping the two models as stacks of cubes and spheres in higher dimensions. Sphere stacking in various containers, i.e. square ice under various boundary conditions, reveals challenging combinatorial questions. This network approach can be generalized to phase spaces of some other complex systems.

010       Measuring Significance of Community Structure in Complex Networks
021       Many complex systems can be represented as networks and separating a network into communities could simplify the functional analysis considerably. 
020       Recently, many approaches have been proposed for finding communities, but none of them can evaluate the communities found are significant or trivial definitely. In this paper, we propose an index to evaluate the significance of communities in networks. The index is based on comparing the similarity between the original community structure in network and the community structure of the network after perturbed, and is defined by integrating all the similarities. Many artificial networks and real-world networks are tested. The results show that the index is independent from the size of network and the number of communities. Moreover, we find the clear communities always exist in social networks, but don't find significative communities in proteins interaction networks and metabolic networks.

010       Influence of reciprocal arcs on the degree distribution and degree   correlations
021       Reciprocal arcs represent the lowest order cycle possible to find in directed graphs without self-loops. 
020       Representing also a measure of feed-back between vertices, it is interesting to understand how reciprocal arcs influence other properties of complex networks. In this paper we focus on influence of reciprocal arcs on vertex degree distribution and degree correlations. We show that there is a fundamental difference between properties observed on the static network compared to the properties of networks which are obtained by simple evolution mechanism driven by reciprocity. We also present a way to statistically infer the portion of reciprocal arcs which can be explained as a consequence of feed-back process on the static network. In the rest of the paper the influence of reciprocal arcs on a model of growing network is also presented. It is shown that our model of growing network nicely interpolates between BA model for undirected and the BA model for directed networks.

010       Planar unclustered graphs to model technological and biological networks
021       Many real life networks present an average path length logarithmic with the number of nodes and a degree distribution which follows a power law. 
020       Often these networks have also a modular and self-similar structure and, in some cases - usually associated with topological restrictions- their clustering is low and they are almost planar. In this paper we introduce a family of graphs which share all these properties and are defined by two parameters. As their construction is deterministic, we obtain exact analytic expressions for relevant properties of the graphs including the degree distribution, degree correlation, diameter, and average distance, as a function of the two defining parameters. Thus, the graphs are useful to model some complex networks, in particular technological and biological networks.

010       Systems approaches and algorithms for discovery of combinatorial   therapies
021       Effective therapy of complex diseases requires control of highly non-linear complex networks that remain incompletely characterized. 
020       In particular, drug intervention can be seen as control of signaling in cellular networks. Identification of control parameters presents an extreme challenge due to the combinatorial explosion of control possibilities in combination therapy and to the incomplete knowledge of the systems biology of cells. In this review paper we describe the main current and proposed approaches to the design of combinatorial therapies, including the empirical methods used now by clinicians and alternative approaches suggested recently by several authors. New approaches for designing combinations arising from systems biology are described. We discuss in special detail the design of algorithms that identify optimal control parameters in cellular networks based on a quantitative characterization of control landscapes, maximizing utilization of incomplete knowledge of the state and structure of intracellular networks. The use of new technology for high-throughput measurements is key to these new approaches to combination therapy and essential for the characterization of control landscapes and implementation of the algorithms. Combinatorial optimization in medical therapy is also compared with the combinatorial optimization of engineering and materials science and similarities and differences are delineated.

021       Spreading of either information or matter can often be treated as a network problem. 
020       It can be of great importance to be able to estimate the likelihood that spreading through a network reaches essentially the entire network while still not reaching certain sub-classes of the network. We show that excluding nodes and edges from the network has a subtle effect on the percolation. We study two specific examples of degree distributions (exponential and scale free) for which analytical solutions can be obtained. The two cases exhibit qualitatively different behavior.

010       Structure of shells in complex networks
021       In a network, we define shell $\ell$ as the set of nodes at distance $\ell$ with respect to a given node and define $r_\ell$ as the fraction of nodes outside shell $\ell$. 
020       In a transport process, information or disease usually diffuses from a random node and reach nodes shell after shell. Thus, understanding the shell structure is crucial for the study of the transport property of networks. For a randomly connected network with given degree distribution, we derive analytically the degree distribution and average degree of the nodes residing outside shell $\ell$ as a function of $r_\ell$. Further, we find that $r_\ell$ follows an iterative functional form $r_\ell=\phi(r_{\ell-1})$, where $\phi$ is expressed in terms of the generating function of the original degree distribution of the network. Our results can explain the power-law distribution of the number of nodes $B_\ell$ found in shells with $\ell$ larger than the network diameter $d$, which is the average distance between all pairs of nodes. For real world networks the theoretical prediction of $r_\ell$ deviates from the empirical $r_\ell$. We introduce a network correlation function $c(r_\ell)\equiv r_{\ell+1}/\phi(r_\ell)$ to characterize the correlations in the network, where $r_{\ell+1}$ is the empirical value and $\phi(r_\ell)$ is the theoretical prediction. $c(r_\ell)=1$ indicates perfect agreement between empirical results and theory. We apply $c(r_\ell)$ to several model and real world networks. We find that the networks fall into two distinct classes: (i) a class of {\it poorly-connected} networks with $c(r_\ell)&gt;1$, which have larger average distances compared with randomly connected networks with the same degree distributions; and (ii) a class of {\it well-connected} networks with $c(r_\ell)&lt;1$.

010       Curvature and temperature of complex networks
021       We show that heterogeneous degree distributions in observed scale-free topologies of complex networks can emerge as a consequence of the exponential expansion of hidden hyperbolic space. 
020       Fermi-Dirac statistics provides a physical interpretation of hyperbolic distances as energies of links. The hidden space curvature affects the heterogeneity of the degree distribution, while clustering is a function of temperature. We embed the Internet into the hyperbolic plane, and find a remarkable congruency between the embedding and our hyperbolic model. Besides proving our model realistic, this embedding may be used for routing with only local information, which holds significant promise for improving the performance of Internet routing.

010       Recursive solutions for Laplacian spectra and eigenvectors of a class of   growing treelike networks
021       The complete knowledge of Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors of complex networks plays an outstanding role in understanding various dynamical processes running on them; however, determining analytically Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors is a theoretical challenge. 
020       In this paper, we study the Laplacian spectra and their corresponding eigenvectors of a class of deterministically growing treelike networks. The two interesting quantities are determined through the recurrence relations derived from the structure of the networks. Beginning from the rigorous relations one can obtain the complete eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the networks of arbitrary size. The analytical method opens the way to analytically compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of some other deterministic networks, making it possible to accurately calculate their spectral characteristics.

020       More specifically, we compare two traditional geographical models with a modified geometrical network model where paths, rather than edges, are incorporated at each step between the origin and destination nodes. Optimal configurations of parameters are obtained for each model and used in the comparison. The highway networks of Brazil, the US and England are considered and shown to be properly modeled by the modified geographical model. The Brazilian highway network yielded small deviations that are potentially accountable by specific developing and sociogeographic features of that country.

010       Continuous-Time Quantum Walks and Trapping
021       Recent findings suggest that processes such as the electronic energy transfer through the photosynthetic antenna display quantal features, aspects known from the dynamics of charge carriers along polymer backbones. 
020       Hence, in modeling energy transfer one has to leave the classical, master-equation-type formalism and advance towards an increasingly quantum-mechanical picture, while still retaining a local description of the complex network of molecules involved in the transport, say through a tight-binding approach. <br />Interestingly, the continuous time random walk (CTRW) picture, widely employed in describing transport in random environments, can be mathematically reformulated to yield a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of tight-binding type; the procedure uses the mathematical analogies between time-evolution operators in statistical and in quantum mechanics: The result are continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs). However, beyond these formal analogies, CTRWs and CTQWs display vastly different physical properties. In particular, here we focus on trapping processes on a ring and show, both analytically and numerically, that distinct configurations of traps (ranging from periodical to random) yield strongly different behaviours for the quantal mean survival probability, while classically (under ordered conditions) we always find an exponential decay at long times.

010       The Continuous Node Degree: a New Measure for Complex Networks
021       A key measure that has been used extensively in analyzing complex networks is the degree of a node (the number of the node's neighbors). 
020       Because of its discrete nature, when the degree measure was used in analyzing weighted networks, weights were either ignored or thresholded in order to retain or disregard an edge. Therefore, despite its popularity, the degree measure fails to capture the disparity of interaction between a node and its neighbors. <br />We introduce in this paper a generalization of the degree measure that addresses this limitation: the continuous node degree (C-degree). The C-degree of a node reflects how many neighbors are effectively being used, taking interaction disparity into account. More importantly, if a node interacts uniformly with its neighbors (no interaction disparity), we prove that the C-degree of the node becomes identical to the node's (discrete) degree. We analyze four real-world weighted networks using the new measure and show that the C-degree distribution follows the power-law, similar to the traditional degree distribution, but with steeper decline. We also show that the ratio between the C-degree and the (discrete) degree follows a pattern that is common in the four studied networks.

021       For models whose evolution takes place on a network it is often necessary to augment the mean-field approach by considering explicitly the degree dependence of average quantities (heterogeneous mean-field). 
020       Here we introduce the degree dependence in the pair approximation (heterogeneous pair approximation) for analyzing voter models on uncorrelated networks. This approach gives an essentially exact description of the dynamics, correcting some inaccurate results of previous approaches. The heterogeneous pair approximation introduced here can be applied in full generality to many other processes on complex networks.

010       Centralized Modularity of N-Linked Glycosylation Pathways in Mammalian   Cells
021       Glycosylation is a highly complex process to produce a diverse repertoire of cellular glycans that are attached to proteins and lipids. 
020       Glycans are involved in fundamental biological processes, including protein folding and clearance, cell proliferation and apoptosis, development, immune responses, and pathogenesis. One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by sequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of enzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as substrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their intermingled pathways. Motivated by the quantitative methods developed in complex network research, we investigated the large-scale organization of such N-linked glycosylation pathways in mammalian cells. The N-linked glycosylation pathways are extremely modular, and are composed of cohesive topological modules that directly branch from a common upstream pathway of glycan synthesis. This unique structural property allows the glycan production between modules to be controlled by the upstream region. Although the enzymes act on multiple glycan substrates, indicating cross-talk between modules, the impact of the cross-talk on the module-specific enhancement of glycan synthesis may be confined within a moderate range by transcription-level control. The findings of the present study provide experimentally-testable predictions for glycosylation processes, and may be applicable to therapeutic glycoprotein engineering.

010       Language Diversity across the Consonant Inventories: A Study in the   Framework of Complex Networks
021       n this paper, we attempt to explain the emergence of the linguistic diversity that exists across the consonant inventories of some of the major language families of the world through a complex network based growth model. 
020       There is only a single parameter for this model that is meant to introduce a small amount of randomness in the otherwise preferential attachment based growth process. The experiments with this model parameter indicates that the choice of consonants among the languages within a family are far more preferential than it is across the families. The implications of this result are twofold -- (a) there is an innate preference of the speakers towards acquiring certain linguistic structures over others and (b) shared ancestry propels the stronger preferential connection between the languages within a family than across them. Furthermore, our observations indicate that this parameter might bear a correlation with the period of existence of the language families under investigation.

010       Fast Computation of Empirically Tight Bounds for the Diameter of Massive   Graphs
021       The diameter of a graph is among its most basic parameters. 
020       Since a few years, it moreover became a key issue to compute it for massive graphs in the context of complex network analysis. However, known algorithms, including the ones producing approximate values, have too high a time and/or space complexity to be used in such cases. We propose here a new approach relying on very simple and fast algorithms that compute (upper and lower) bounds for the diameter. We show empirically that, on various real-world cases representative of complex networks studied in the literature, the obtained bounds are very tight (and even equal in some cases). This leads to rigorous and very accurate estimations of the actual diameter in cases which were previously untractable in practice.

010       Stochastic Control Analysis for Biochemical Reaction Systems
021       In this paper, we investigate how stochastic reaction processes are affected by external perturbations. 
020       We describe an extension of the deterministic metabolic control analysis (MCA) to the stochastic regime. We introduce stochastic sensitivities for mean and covariance values of reactant concentrations and reaction fluxes and show that there exist MCA-like summation theorems among these sensitivities. The summation theorems for flux variances are shown to depend on the size of the measurement time window ($\epsilon$), within which reaction events are counted for measuring a single flux. The degree of the $\epsilon$-dependency can become significant for processes involving multi-time-scale dynamics and is estimated by introducing a new measure of time scale separation. This $\epsilon$-dependency is shown to be closely related to the power-law scaling observed in flux fluctuations in various complex networks. We propose a systematic way to control fluctuations of reactant concentrations while minimizing changes in mean concentration levels. Such orthogonal control is obtained by introducing a control vector indicating the strength and direction of parameter perturbations leading to a sensitive control. We also propose a possible implication in the control of flux fluctuation: The control distribution for flux fluctuations changes with the measurement time window size, $\epsilon$. When a control engineer applies a specific control operation on a reaction system, the system can respond contrary to what is expected, depending on the time window size $\epsilon$.

010       Spectral Characteristics of Network Redundancy
021       Many real-world complex networks contain a significant amount of structural redundancy, in which multiple vertices play identical topological roles. 
020       Such redundancy arises naturally from the simple growth processes which form and shape many real-world systems. Since structurally redundant elements may be permuted without altering network structure, redundancy may be formally investigated by examining network automorphism (symmetry) groups. Here, we use a group-theoretic approach to give a complete description of spectral signatures of redundancy in undirected networks. In particular, we describe how a network's automorphism group may be used to directly associate specific eigenvalues and eigenvectors with specific network motifs.

010       Efficient Measurement of Complex Networks Using Link Queries
021       Complex networks are at the core of an intense research activity. 
020       However, in most cases, intricate and costly measurement procedures are needed to explore their structure. In some cases, these measurements rely on link queries: given two nodes, it is possible to test the existence of a link between them. These tests may be costly, and thus minimizing their number while maximizing the number of discovered links is a key issue. This paper studies this problem: we observe that properties classically observed on real-world complex networks give hints for their efficient measurement; we derive simple principles and several measurement strategies based on this, and experimentally evaluate their efficiency on real-world cases. In order to do so, we introduce methods to evaluate the efficiency of strategies. We also explore the bias that different measurement strategies may induce.

010       Approximate Triangle Counting
021       Triangle counting is an important problem in graph mining. 
020       Clustering coefficients of vertices and the transitivity ratio of the graph are two metrics often used in complex network analysis. Furthermore, triangles have been used successfully in several real-world applications. However, exact triangle counting is an expensive computation. In this paper we present the analysis of a practical sampling algorithm for counting triangles in graphs. Our analysis yields optimal values for the sampling rate, thus resulting in tremendous speedups ranging from \emph{2800}x to \emph{70000}x when applied to real-world networks. At the same time the accuracy of the estimation is excellent. <br />Our contributions include experimentation on graphs with several millions of nodes and edges, where we show how practical our proposed method is. Finally, our algorithm's implementation is a part of the \pegasus library (Code and datasets are available at (<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ctsourak/">this http URL</a>).) a Peta-Graph Mining library implemented in Hadoop, the open source version of Mapreduce.

010       Benchmarks for testing community detection algorithms on directed and   weighted graphs with overlapping communities
021       Many complex networks display a mesoscopic structure with groups of nodes sharing many links with the other nodes in their group and comparatively few with nodes of different groups. 
020       This feature is known as community structure and encodes precious information about the organization and the function of the nodes. Many algorithms have been proposed but it is not yet clear how they should be tested. Recently we have proposed a general class of undirected and unweighted benchmark graphs, with heterogenous distributions of node degree and community size. An increasing attention has been recently devoted to develop algorithms able to consider the direction and the weight of the links, which require suitable benchmark graphs for testing. In this paper we extend the basic ideas behind our previous benchmark to generate directed and weighted networks with built-in community structure. We also consider the possibility that nodes belong to more communities, a feature occurring in real systems, like, e. g., social networks. As a practical application, we show how modularity optimization performs on our new benchmark.

010       Levy flights in confining potentials
021       We analyze confining mechanisms for L\'{e}vy flights. 
020       When they evolve in suitable external potentials their variance may exist and show signatures of a superdiffusive transport. Two classes of stochastic jump - type processes are considered: those driven by Langevin equation with L\'{e}vy noise and those, named by us topological L\'{e}vy processes (occurring in systems with topological complexity like folded polymers or complex networks and generically in inhomogeneous media), whose Langevin representation is unknown and possibly nonexistent. Our major finding is that both above classes of processes stay in affinity and may share common stationary (eventually asymptotic) probability density, even if their detailed dynamical behavior look different. That generalizes and offers new solutions to a reverse engineering (e.g. targeted stochasticity) problem due to I. Eliazar and J. Klafter [J. Stat. Phys. 111, 739, (2003)]: design a L\'{e}vy process whose target pdf equals a priori preselected one. Our observations extend to a broad class of L\'{e}vy noise driven processes, like e.g. superdiffusion on folded polymers, geophysical flows and even climatic changes.

010       Disassortativity of random critical branching trees
021       Random critical branching trees (CBTs) are generated by the multiplicative branching process, where the branching number is determined stochastically, independent of the degree of their ancestor. 
020       Here we show analytically that despite this stochastic independence, there exists the degree-degree correlation (DDC) in the CBT and it is disassortative. Moreover, the skeletons of fractal networks, the maximum spanning trees formed by the edge betweenness centrality, behave similarly to the CBT in the DDC. This analytic solution and observation support the argument that the fractal scaling in complex networks originates from the disassortativity in the DDC.

010       Glass transition and random walks on complex energy landscapes

We point out how the relation between the energies of the minima and their number of neighbors should be studied in connection with the network's global topology, and show how the tools developed in complex network theory can be put to use in this context.

010       Hypergraph topological quantities for tagged social networks
021       Recent years have witnessed the emergence of a new class of social networks, that require us to move beyond previously employed representations of complex graph structures. 
020       A notable example is that of the folksonomy, an online process where users collaboratively employ tags to resources to impart structure to an otherwise undifferentiated database. In a recent paper[1] we proposed a mathematical model that represents these structures as tripartite hypergraphs and defined basic topological quantities of interest. In this paper we extend our model by defining additional quantities such as edge distributions, vertex similarity and correlations as well as clustering. We then empirically measure these quantities on two real life folksonomies, the popular online photo sharing site Flickr and the bookmarking site CiteULike. We find that these systems share similar qualitative features with the majority of complex networks that have been previously studied. We propose that the quantities and methodology described here can be used as a standard tool in measuring the structure of tagged networks.

010       Complex Networks on a Rock Joint
021       A complex network approach on a rough fracture is developed. 
020       In this manner, some hidden metric spaces (similarity measurements) between apertures profiles are set up and a general evolutionary network in two directions (in parallel and perpendicular to the shear direction) is constructed. Also, an algorithm (COmplex Networks on Apertures: CONA) is proposed in which evolving of a network is accomplished using preferential detachments and attachments of edges (based on a competition and game manner) while the number of nodes is fixed. Also, evolving of clustering coefficients and number of edges display similar patterns as well as are appeared in shear stress, hydraulic conductivity and dilation changes, which can be engaged to estimate shear strength distribution of asperities.

010       Resilience of public transport networks against attacks
021       The behavior of complex networks under failure or attack depends strongly on the specific scenario. 
020       Of special interest are scale-free networks, which are usually seen as robust under random failure but appear to be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. In recent studies of public transport networks of fourteen major cities of the world it was shown that these systems when represented by appropriate graphs may exhibit scale-free behavior [C. von Ferber et al., Physica A 380, 585 (2007), Eur. Phys. J. B 68, 261 (2009)]. Our present analysis, focuses on the effects that defunct or removed nodes have on the properties of public transport networks. Simulating different directed attack strategies, we derive vulnerability criteria that result in minimal strategies with high impact on these systems.

010       Enhancing the robustness of scale-free networks
021       Error tolerance and attack vulnerability are two common and important properties of complex networks, which are usually used to evaluate the robustness of a network. 
020       Recently, much work has been devoted to determining the network design with optimal robustness. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of how to improve the robustness of existing networks. In this paper, we present a new parameter alpha, called enforcing parameter, to guide the process of enhancing the robustness of scale-free networks by gradually adding new links. Intuitively, alpha &lt; 0 means the nodes with lower degrees are selected preferentially while the nodes with higher degrees will be more probably selected when alpha &gt; 0. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that when alpha &lt; 0 the attack survivability of the network can be enforced apparently. Then we propose new strategies to enhance the network robustness. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we conclude that establishing new links between nodes with low degrees can drastically enforce the attack survivability of scale-free networks while having little impact on the error tolerance.

010       Modeling the IPv6 Internet AS-level Topology
021       To measure the IPv6 internet AS-level topology, a network topology discovery system, called Dolphin, was developed. 
020       By comparing the measurement result of Dolphin with that of CAIDA's Scamper, it was found that the IPv6 Internet at AS level, similar to other complex networks, is also scale-free but the exponent of its degree distribution is 1.2, which is much smaller than that of the IPv4 Internet and most other scale-free networks. In order to explain this feature of IPv6 Internet we argue that the degree exponent is a measure of uniformity of the degree distribution. Then, for the purpose on modeling the networks, we propose a new model based on the two major factors affecting the exponent of the EBA model. It breaks the lower bound of degree exponent which is 2 for most models. To verify the validity of this model, both theoretical and experimental analyses have been carried out. Finally, we demonstrate how this model can be successfully used to reproduce the topology of the IPv6 Internet.

021       Percolation on complex networks has been used to study computer viruses, epidemics, and other casual processes. 
020       Here, we present conditions for the existence of a network specific, observation dependent, phase transition in the updated posterior of node states resulting from actively monitoring the network. Since traditional percolation thresholds are derived using observation independent Markov chains, the threshold of the posterior should more accurately model the true phase transition of a network, as the updated posterior more accurately tracks the process. These conditions should provide insight into modeling the dynamic response of the updated posterior to active intervention and control policies while monitoring large complex networks.

010       Quantifying and identifying the overlapping community structure in   networks
021       It has been shown that the communities of complex networks often overlap with each other. 
020       However, there is no effective method to quantify the overlapping community structure. In this paper, we propose a metric to address this problem. Instead of assuming that one node can only belong to one community, our metric assumes that a maximal clique only belongs to one community. In this way, the overlaps between communities are allowed. To identify the overlapping community structure, we construct a maximal clique network from the original network, and prove that the optimization of our metric on the original network is equivalent to the optimization of Newman's modularity on the maximal clique network. Thus the overlapping community structure can be identified through partitioning the maximal clique network using any modularity optimization method. The effectiveness of our metric is demonstrated by extensive tests on both the artificial networks and the real world networks with known community structure. The application to the word association network also reproduces excellent results.

010       Atomic-detailed milestones along the folding trajectory of protein G
021       The high computational cost of carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of even small-size proteins is a major obstacle in the study, at atomic detail and in explicit solvent, of the physical mechanism which is at the basis of the folding of proteins. 
020       Making use of a biasing algorithm, based on the principle of the ratchet-and-pawl, we have been able to calculate eight folding trajectories (to an RMSD between 1.2A and 2.5A) of the B1 domain of protein G in explicit solvent without the need of high-performance computing. The simulations show that in the denatured state there is a complex network of cause-effect relationships among contacts, which results in a rather hierarchical folding mechanism. The network displays few local and nonlocal native contacts which are cause of most of the others, in agreement with the NOE signals obtained in mildly-denatured conditions. Also nonnative contacts play an active role in the folding kinetics. The set of conformations corresponding to the transition state display phi-values with a correlation coefficient of 0.69 with the experimental ones. They are structurally quite homogeneous and topologically native-like, although some of the side chains and most of the hydrogen bonds are not in place.

010       Effective and Efficient Similarity Index for Link Prediction of Complex   Networks
021       Predictions of missing links of incomplete networks like protein-protein interaction networks or very likely but not yet existent links in evolutionary networks like friendship networks in web society can be considered as a guideline for further experiments or valuable information for web users. 
020       In this paper, we introduce a local path index to estimate the likelihood of the existence of a link between two nodes. We propose a network model with controllable density and noise strength in generating links, as well as collect data of six real networks. Extensive numerical simulations on both modeled networks and real networks demonstrated the high effectiveness and efficiency of the local path index compared with two well-known and widely used indices, the common neighbors and the Katz index. Indeed, the local path index provides competitively accurate predictions as the Katz index while requires much less CPU time and memory space, which is therefore a strong candidate for potential practical applications in data mining of huge-size networks.

010       Unravelling the size distribution of social groups with information   theory on complex networks
021       The minimization of Fisher's information (MFI) approach of Frieden et al. 
020       [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 60} 48 (1999)] is applied to the study of size distributions in social groups on the basis of a recently established analogy between scale invariant systems and classical gases [<a href="/abs/0908.0504">arXiv:0908.0504</a>]. Going beyond the ideal gas scenario is seen to be tantamount to simulating the interactions taking place in a network's competitive cluster growth process. We find a scaling rule that allows to classify the final cluster-size distributions using only one parameter that we call the competitiveness. Empirical city-size distributions and electoral results can be thus reproduced and classified according to this competitiveness, which also allows to correctly predict well-established assessments such as the "six-degrees of separation", which is shown here to be a direct consequence of the maximum number of stable social relationships that one person can maintain, known as Dunbar's number. Finally, we show that scaled city-size distributions of large countries follow the same universal distribution.

010       Mesoscopic organization reveals the constraints governing C. elegans   nervous system
021       One of the biggest challenges in biology is to understand how activity at the cellular level of neurons, as a result of their mutual interactions, leads to the observed behavior of an organism responding to a variety of environmental stimuli. 
020       Investigating the intermediate or mesoscopic level of organization in the nervous system is a vital step towards understanding how the integration of micro-level dynamics results in macro-level functioning. In this paper, we have considered the somatic nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, for which the entire neuronal connectivity diagram is known. We focus on the organization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having relatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network. We show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms of considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total wiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length). Comparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of signals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class. This suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of sensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a vital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral analysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure in the nervous system. This is further brought out by identifying functionally critical neurons purely on the basis of patterns of intra- and inter-modular connections. Our study reveals how the design of the nervous system reflects several constraints, including its key functional role as a processor of information.

010       "Clumpiness" Mixing in Complex Networks
021       Three measures of clumpiness of complex networks are introduced. 
020       The measures quantify how most central nodes of a network are clumped together. The assortativity coefficient defined in a previous study measures a similar characteristic, but accounts only for the clumpiness of the central nodes that are directly connected to each other. The clumpiness coefficient defined in the present paper also takes into account the cases where central nodes are separated by a few links. The definition is based on the node degrees and the distances between pairs of nodes. The clumpiness coefficient together with the assortativity coefficient can define four classes of network. Numerical calculations demonstrate that the classification scheme successfully categorizes 30 real-world networks into the four classes: clumped assortative, clumped disassortative, loose assortative and loose disassortative networks. The clumpiness coefficient also differentiates the Erdos-Renyi model from the Barabasi-Albert model, which the assortativity coefficient could not differentiate. In addition, the bounds of the clumpiness coefficient as well as the relationships between the three measures of clumpiness are discussed.

010       Statistical-mechanical approach to subgraph centrality in complex   networks
021       We interpret the subgraph centrality as the partition function of a network. 
020       The entropy, the internal energy and the Helmholtz free energy are defined for networks and molecular graphs on the basis of graph spectral theory. Various relations of these quantities to the structure and the dynamics of the complex networks are discussed. They include the cohesiveness of the network and the critical coupling of coupled phase oscillators. We explore several models of network growing/evolution as well as real-world networks, such as those representing metabolic and protein-protein interaction networks as well as the interaction between secondary structure elements in proteins.

010       Communicability and multipartite structures in complex networks at   negative absolute temperatures
021       We here present a method of clearly identifying multi-partite subgraphs in a network. 
020       The method is based on a recently introduced concept of the communicability, which very clearly identifies communities in a complex network. We here show that, while the communicability at a positive temperature is useful in identifying communities, the communicability at a negative temperature is useful in idenfitying multi-partitite subgraphs; the latter quantity between two nodes is positive when the two nodes belong to the same subgraph and is negative when not. The method is able to discover `almost' multi-partite structures, where inter-community connections vastly outweigh intracommunity connections. We illustrate the relevance of this work to real-life food web and protein-protein interaction networks.

010       Communicability Betweenness in Complex Networks
021       Betweenness measures provide quantitative tools to pick out fine details from the massive amount of interaction data that is available from large complex networks. 
020       They allow us to study the extent to which a node takes part when information is passed around the network. Nodes with high betweenness may be regarded as key players that have a highly active role. At one extreme, betweenness has been defined by considering information passing only through the shortest paths between pairs of nodes. At the other extreme, an alternative type of betweenness has been defined by considering all possible walks of any length. In this work, we propose a betweenness measure that lies between these two opposing viewpoints. We allow information to pass through all possible routes, but introduce a scaling so that longer walks carry less importance. This new definition shares a similar philosophy to that of communicability for pairs of nodes in a network, which was introduced by Estrada and Hatano (Phys. Rev. E 77 (2008) 036111). Having defined this new communicability betweenness measure, we show that it can be characterized neatly in terms of the exponential of the adjacency matrix. We also show that this measure is closely related to a Frechet derivative of the matrix exponential. This allows us to conclude that it also describes network sensitivity when the edges of a given node are subject to infinitesimally small perturbations. Using illustrative synthetic and real life networks, we show that the new betweenness measure behaves differently to existing versions, and in particular we show that it recovers meaningful biological information from a protein-protein interaction network.

010       Communicability Graph and Community Structures in Complex Networks
021       We use the concept of the network communicability (Phys. 
020       Rev. E 77 (2008) 036111) to define communities in a complex network. The communities are defined as the cliques of a communicability graph, which has the same set of nodes as the complex network and links determined by the communicability function. Then, the problem of finding the network communities is transformed to an all-clique problem of the communicability graph. We discuss the efficiency of this algorithm of community detection. In addition, we extend here the concept of the communicability to account for the strength of the interactions between the nodes by using the concept of inverse temperature of the network. Finally, we develop an algorithm to manage the different degrees of overlapping between the communities in a complex network. We then analyze the USA airport network, for which we successfully detect two big communities of the eastern airports and of the western/central airports as well as two bridging central communities. In striking contrast, a well-known algorithm groups all but two of the continental airports into one community.

010       A New Methodology for Generalizing Unweighted Network Measures
021       Several important complex network measures that helped discovering common patterns across real-world networks ignore edge weights, an important information in real-world networks. 
020       We propose a new methodology for generalizing measures of unweighted networks through a generalization of the cardinality concept of a set of weights. The key observation here is that many measures of unweighted networks use the cardinality (the size) of some subset of edges in their computation. For example, the node degree is the number of edges incident to a node. We define the effective cardinality, a new metric that quantifies how many edges are effectively being used, assuming that an edge's weight reflects the amount of interaction across that edge. We prove that a generalized measure, using our method, reduces to the original unweighted measure if there is no disparity between weights, which ensures that the laws that govern the original unweighted measure will also govern the generalized measure when the weights are equal. We also prove that our generalization ensures a partial ordering (among sets of weighted edges) that is consistent with the original unweighted measure, unlike previously developed generalizations. We illustrate the applicability of our method by generalizing four unweighted network measures. As a case study, we analyze four real-world weighted networks using our generalized degree and clustering coefficient. The analysis shows that the generalized degree distribution is consistent with the power-law hypothesis but with steeper decline and that there is a common pattern governing the ratio between the generalized degree and the traditional degree. The analysis also shows that nodes with more uniform weights tend to cluster with nodes that also have more uniform weights among themselves.

021       A new complex network model is proposed which is founded on growth with new connections being established proportionally to the current dynamical activity of each node, which can be understood as a generalization of the Barabasi-Albert static model. 
020       By using several topological measurements, as well as optimal multivariate methods (canonical analysis and maximum likelihood decision), we show that this new model provides, among several other theoretical types of networks including Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, the greatest compatibility with three real-world cortical networks.

010       Detecting Structure of Complex Network by Quantum Bosonic Dynamics
021       We introduce a non-interacting boson model to investigate topological structure of complex networks in the present paper. 
020       By exactly solving this model, we show that it provides a powerful analytical tool in uncovering the important properties of real-world networks. We find that the ground state degeneracy of this model is equal to the number of connected components in the network and the square of coefficients in the expansion of ground state gives the averaged time for a random walker spending at each node in the infinite time limit. Furthermore, the first excited state appears always on its largest connected component. To show usefulness of this approach in practice, we carry on also numerical simulations on some concrete complex networks. Our results are completely consistent with the previous conclusions derived by graph theory methods.

010       Universal driving structure of self-sustained oscillatory complex   networks
021       Recently, self-sustained oscillations in complex networks consisting of nonoscillatory nodes (network oscillators) have attracted great interest in diverse natural and social fields. 
020       Due to complexity of network behaviors, little is known so far about the basic structures and fundamental rules underlying the oscillations, not to mention the principles of how to control it. In this article we propose a common design principle for oscillations; predict novel and universal Branched Circle (BC) structures of oscillatory networks based on this principle; and suggest an operable Complexity Reduction Method to reveal the BC structures. These ideas are applied to excitable cell networks (including neural cell networks), and genomic regulatory networks. Universal BC structures are identified clearly in these two considerably different systems. These BC structures reveal for the first time both oscillation sources and wave propagation pathways of complex networks, and guide us to control the oscillations with surprisingly high efficiency.

020       Complex networks have rich and intriguing properties, which are as yet unexplored in the quantum setting. Here, we study the effect of entanglement percolation as a means to establish long-distance entanglement between arbitrary nodes of quantum complex networks. We develop a theory to analytically study random graphs with arbitrary degree distribution and give exact results for some models. Our findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations and show that the proposed quantum strategies enhance the percolation threshold substantially. Simulations also show a clear enhancement in small-world and other real-world networks.

Using mean field method, we obtain an analytical understanding of the resonant phenomenon by deriving the effective potential of the system.

010       A minimal model for congestion phenomena on complex networks
021       We study a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks, simple enough to get analytical results, but with a very rich phenomenology, presenting continuous, discontinuous as well as hybrid phase transitions between a free-flow phase and a congested phase, critical points and different scaling behaviors in the system size. 
020       It consists of random walkers on a queueing network with one-range repulsion, where particles can be destroyed only if they can move. We focus on the dependence on the topology as well as on the level of traffic control. We are able to obtain transition curves and phase diagrams at analytical level for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks and numerically for single instances. We find that traffic control improves global performance, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space only in heterogeneous networks. Traffic control introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner. The model also reproduces the cross-over in the scaling of traffic fluctuations empirically observed in the Internet, and moreover, a conserved version can reproduce qualitatively some stylized facts of traffic in transportation networks.

010       Analysis of relative influence of nodes in directed networks
021       Many complex networks are described by directed links; in such networks, a link represents, for example, the control of one node over the other node or unidirectional information flows. 
020       Some centrality measures are used to determine the relative importance of nodes specifically in directed networks. We analyze such a centrality measure called the influence. The influence represents the importance of nodes in various dynamics such as synchronization, evolutionary dynamics, random walk, and social dynamics. We analytically calculate the influence in various networks, including directed multipartite networks and a directed version of the Watts-Strogatz small-world network. The global properties of networks such as hierarchy and position of shortcuts, rather than local properties of the nodes, such as the degree, are shown to be the chief determinants of the influence of nodes in many cases. The developed method is also applicable to the calculation of the PageRank. We also numerically show that in a coupled oscillator system, the threshold for entrainment by a pacemaker is low when the pacemaker is placed on influential nodes. For a type of random network, the analytically derived threshold is approximately equal to the inverse of the influence. We numerically show that this relationship also holds true in a random scale-free network and a neural network.

010       Jamming transition in air transportation networks
021       In this work we present a model of an air transportation traffic system from the complex network modelling viewpoint. 
020       In the network, every node corresponds to a given airport, and two nodes are connected by means of flight routes. Each node is weighted according to its load capacity, and links are weighted according to the Euclidean distance that separates each pair of nodes. Local rules describing the behavior of individual nodes in terms of the surrounding flow have been also modelled, and a random network topology has been chosen in a baseline approach. Numerical simulations describing the diffusion of a given number of agents (aircraft) in this network show the onset of a jamming transition that distinguishes an efficient regime with null amount of airport queues and high diffusivity (free phase) and a regime where bottlenecks suddenly take place, leading to a poor aircraft diffusion (congested phase). Fluctuations are maximal around the congestion threshold, suggesting that the transition is critical. We then proceed by exploring the robustness of our results in neutral random topologies by embedding the model in heterogeneous networks. Specifically, we make use of the European air transportation network formed by 858 airports and 11170 flight routes connecting them, which we show to be scale-free. The jamming transition is also observed in this case. These results and methodologies may introduce relevant decision making procedures in order to optimize the air transportation traffic.

021       We study stochastic processes that generate non-growing complex networks without self-loops and multiple edges (simple graphs). 
020       The work concentrates on understanding and formulation of constraints which keep the rewiring stochastic processes within the class of simple graphs. To formulate these constraints a new concept of wedge distribution (paths of length 2) is introduced and its relation to degree-degree correlation is studied. The analysis shows that the constraints, together with edge selection rules, do not even allow to formulate a closed master equation in the general case. We also introduce a particular stochastic process which does not contain edge selection rules, but which, we believe, can provide some insight into the complexities of simple graphs.

010       Discrete-time Markov chain approach to contact-based disease spreading   in complex networks
021       Many epidemic processes in networks spread by stochastic contacts among their connected vertices. 
020       There are two limiting cases widely analyzed in the physics literature, the so-called contact process (CP) where the contagion is expanded at a certain rate from an infected vertex to one neighbor at a time, and the reactive process (RP) in which an infected individual effectively contacts all its neighbors to expand the epidemics. However, a more realistic scenario is obtained from the interpolation between these two cases, considering a certain number of stochastic contacts per unit time. Here we propose a discrete-time formulation of the problem of contact-based epidemic spreading. We resolve a family of models, parameterized by the number of stochastic contact trials per unit time, that range from the CP to the RP. In contrast to the common heterogeneous mean-field approach, we focus on the probability of infection of individual nodes. Using this formulation, we can construct the whole phase diagram of the different infection models and determine their critical properties.

020       A possible roadmap to solve the problem is via extending key concepts of information theory to networks. In this paper we propose how to define the Shannon entropy of a network ensemble and how it relates to the Gibbs and von Neumann entropies of network ensembles. The quantities we introduce here will play a crucial role for the formulation of null models of networks through maximum-entropy arguments and will contribute to inference problems emerging in the field of complex networks.

010       Role of Weak Ties in Link Prediction of Complex Networks
021       Plenty of algorithms for link prediction have been proposed and were applied to various real networks. 
020       Among these works, the weights of links are rarely taken into account. In this paper, we use local similarity indices to estimate the likelihood of the existence of links in weighted networks, including Common Neighbor, Adamic-Adar Index, Resource Allocation Index, and their weighted versions. In both the unweighted and weighted cases, the resource allocation index performs the best. To our surprise, the weighted indices perform worse, which reminds us of the well-known Weak Tie Theory. Further extensive experimental study shows that the weak ties play a significant role in the link prediction problem, and to emphasize the contribution of weak ties can remarkably enhance the predicting accuracy.

010       Quantum complex networks
021       In recent years, new algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on the laws of quantum physics have been designed to outperform classical communication and computation. 
020       We show that the quantum world also opens up new perspectives in the field of complex networks. Already the simplest model of a classical random network changes dramatically when extended to the quantum case, as we obtain a completely distinct behavior of the critical probabilities at which different subgraphs appear. In particular, in a network of N nodes, any quantum subgraph can be generated by local operations and classical communication if the entanglement between pairs of nodes scales as 1/N^2.

010       Complex Network Approach for Recurrence Analysis of Time Series
021       We propose a novel approach for analysing time series using complex network theory. 
020       We identify the recurrence matrix calculated from time series with the adjacency matrix of a complex network, and apply measures for the characterisation of complex networks to this recurrence matrix. By using the logistic map, we illustrate the potentials of these complex network measures for detecting dynamical transitions. Finally we apply the proposed approach to a marine palaeo-climate record and identify subtle changes of the climate regime.

010       Complex networks in climate dynamics - Comparing linear and nonlinear   network construction methods
021       Complex network theory provides a powerful framework to statistically investigate the topology of local and non-local statistical interrelationships, i.e. 
020       teleconnections, in the climate system. Climate networks constructed from the same global climatological data set using the linear Pearson correlation coefficient or the nonlinear mutual information as a measure of dynamical similarity between regions, are compared systematically on local, mesoscopic and global topological scales. A high degree of similarity is observed on the local and mesoscopic topological scales for surface air temperature fields taken from AOGCM and reanalysis data sets. We find larger differences on the global scale, particularly in the betweenness centrality field. The global scale view on climate networks obtained using mutual information offers promising new perspectives for detecting network structures based on nonlinear physical processes in the climate system.

010       Treewidth of Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi Random Graphs, Random Intersection   Graphs, and Scale-Free Random Graphs
021       We prove that the treewidth of an Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph $\rg{n, m}$ is, with high probability, greater than $\beta n$ for some constant $\beta &gt; 0$ if the edge/vertex ratio $\frac{m}{n}$ is greater than 1.073. 
020       Our lower bound $\frac{m}{n} &gt; 1.073$ improves the only previously-known lower bound. We also study the treewidth of random graphs under two other random models for large-scale complex networks. In particular, our result on the treewidth of \rigs strengths a previous observation on the average-case behavior of the \textit{gate matrix layout} problem. For scale-free random graphs based on the Barab\'{a}si-Albert preferential-attachment model, our result shows that if more than 12 vertices are attached to a new vertex, then the treewidth of the obtained network is linear in the size of the network with high probability.

010       Complex networks: A mixture of power-law and Weibull distributions
021       Complex networks have recently aroused a lot of interest. 
020       However, network edges are considered to be the same in almost all these studies. In this paper, we present a simple classification method, which divides the edges of undirected, unweighted networks into two types: p2c and p2p. The p2c edge represents a hierarchical relationship between two nodes, while the p2p edge represents an equal relationship between two nodes. It is surprising and unexpected that for many real-world networks from a wide variety of domains (including computer science, transportation, biology, engineering and social science etc), the p2c degree distribution follows a power law more strictly than the total degree distribution, while the p2p degree distribution follows the Weibull distribution very well. Thus, the total degree distribution can be seen as a mixture of power-law and Weibull distributions. More surprisingly, it is found that in many cases, the total degree distribution can be better described by the Weibull distribution, rather than a power law as previously suggested. By comparing two topology models, we think that the origin of the Weibull distribution in complex networks might be a mixture of both preferential and random attachments when networks evolve.

010       How small are building blocks of complex networks
021       Network motifs are small building blocks of complex networks, such as gene regulatory networks. 
020       The frequent appearance of a motif may be an indication of some network-specific utility for that motif, such as speeding up the response times of gene circuits. However, the precise nature of the connection between motifs and the global structure and function of networks remains unclear. Here we show that the global structure of some real networks is statistically determined by the distributions of local motifs of size at most 3, once we augment motifs to include node degree information. That is, remarkably, the global properties of these networks are fixed by the probability of the presence of links between node triples, once this probability accounts for the degree of the individual nodes. We consider a social web of trust, protein interactions, scientific collaborations, air transportation, the Internet, and a power grid. In all cases except the power grid, random networks that maintain the degree-enriched connectivity profiles for node triples in the original network reproduce all its local and global properties. This finding provides an alternative statistical explanation for motif significance. It also impacts research on network topology modeling and generation. Such models and generators are guaranteed to reproduce essential local and global network properties as soon as they reproduce their 3-node connectivity statistics.

010       Recurrence networks - A novel paradigm for nonlinear time series   analysis
021       This paper presents a new approach for analysing structural properties of time series from complex systems. 
020       Starting from the concept of recurrences in phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is presented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex networks that also includes other methods as special cases. <br />It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the topological properties of recurrence networks and the statistical properties of the phase space density of the underlying dynamical system. Hence, the network description yields new quantitative characteristics of the dynamical complexity of a time series, which substantially complement existing measures of recurrence quantification analysis.

010       Antiferromagnetic Ising model in scale-free networks
021       The antiferromagnetic Ising model in uncorrelated scale-free networks has been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. 
020       These networks are characterized by a connectivity (or degree) distribution P(k) ~ k^(- gamma). The disorder present in these complex networks frustrates the antiferromagnetic spin ordering, giving rise to a spin-glass (SG) phase at low temperature. The paramagnetic-SG transition temperature T_c has been studied as a function of the parameter gamma and the minimum degree present in the networks. T_c is found to increase when the exponent gamma is reduced, in line with a larger frustration caused by the presence of nodes with higher degree.

010       A network criterion for the success of cooperation in an evolutionary   prisoner's dilemma, and a variation on Hamilton's rule
021       We show that the success of cooperation in an evolutionary prisoner's dilemma on a complex network can be predicted by a simple, quantitative network analysis using mean field parameters. 
020       The criterion is shown to be accurate on a wide variety of networks with degree distributions ranging from regular to Poisson to scale-free. The network analysis uses a parameter that allows for comparisons of networks with both similar, and distinct, topologies. Furthermore, we establish the criterion here as a natural network analogue of Hamilton's classical rule for kin selection, despite arising in an entirely different context. The result is a network-based evolutionary rule for altruism that parallels Hamilton's genetic rule.

Crossovers between the different scientific disciplines and organizational units are observable on a daily basis. Since collaborative research has become the dominant and most promising way to produce high-quality output, collaboration structures are also a target for research and management design. <br />We study co-authorship covered by the Citation Index within University College Dublin, a large Irish university. We focus especially on collaborations between organizational units, such as schools or colleges. We compare the centrality of the brokerage individuals within their organizational units. The network of co-authorship is analyzed with standard network measures, with typical features for complex networks observed. We use the bipartite network of authors and papers for the identification of communities of collaborators and clusters of papers. The observed communities are compared to the formal organizational units of the university.

010       Asymptotic analysis of first passage time in complex networks
021       The first passage time (FPT) distribution for random walk in complex networks is calculated through an asymptotic analysis. 
020       For network with size $N$ and short relaxation time $\tau\ll N$, the computed mean first passage time (MFPT), which is inverse of the decay rate of FPT distribution, is inversely proportional to the degree of the destination. These results are verified numerically for the paradigmatic networks with excellent agreement. We show that the range of validity of the analytical results covers networks that have short relaxation time and high mean degree, which turn out to be valid to many real networks.

010       Global mean first-passage times of random walks on complex networks
021       We present a general framework, applicable to a broad class of random walks on complex networks, which provides a rigorous lower bound for the mean first-passage time of a random walker to a target site averaged over its starting position, the so-called global mean first-passage time (GMFPT). 
020       This bound is simply expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution at the target, and implies a minimal scaling of the GMFPT with the network size. We show that this minimal scaling, which can be arbitrarily slow for a proper choice of highly connected target, is realized under the simple condition that the random walk is transient at the target site, and independently of the small-world, scale free or fractal properties of the network. Last, we put forward that the GMFPT to a specific target is not a representative property of the network, since the target averaged GMFPT satisfies much more restrictive bounds, which forbid any sublinear scaling with the network size.

010       Discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in complex networks
021       We investigate numerically dynamical aspects of the discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (DNLS) in finite lattices. 
020       We start from a periodic chain with nearest neighbor interaction and insert distant links that connect random pairs of sites across the lattice. For a localized initial condition we focus on the time averaged probability at the initial site analyzed as a function of the degree of complexity of the lattice. We find that selftrapping occurs at increasingly larger values of the nonlinearity parameter as the lattice connectivity increases while close to the fully connected network localization becomes more preferred. The nonlinear network dynamical behavior is understood as a competition of two lattice limits, viz. that of pure nearest neighbor interaction as well as the mean field limit where all sites are mutually coupled.

Each vertex $X_i$ is assigned at random a sector $S_i$ of central angle $\alpha$ with inclination $Y_i$, in a circle of radius $r$ (with vertex $X_i$ as the origin). An arc is present from vertex $X_i$ to $X_j$, if $X_j$ falls in $S_i$. Suppose $k$ is fixed and $\{k_n\}$ is a sequence with $1\ll k_n\ll n^{1/2}$, as $n\to\infty$. We prove central limit theorems for $k-$ and $k_n-$nearest neighbor distance of out- and in-degrees in $G_n$. We also show that the degree distribution of this model, which varies with the probability distribution of the underlying point processes, can be either homogeneous or inhomogeneous. Our work should provide valuable insights for alternative mechanisms wrapped in real-world complex networks.

010       Decelerated Spreading Processes in Degree-correlated Networks
021       We demonstrate that a broad spectrum of spreading processes taking place on complex networks can be categorized into two fundamentally different regimes, in which either positive or negative degree-degree correlation decelerates their propagation. 
020       This result can be explained by the role of the nodes with a high connectivity and their distribution in the network, while they act either as accelerators or delayers. This finding is relevant for controlling the velocity of many different spreading processes, ranging from epidemic diseases to dissemination of information and cascading failures in power grids.

010       Traffic-driven Epidemic Spreading in Finite-size Scale-Free Networks
021       The study of complex networks sheds light on the relation between the structure and function of complex systems. 
020       One remarkable result is the absence of an epidemic threshold in infinite-size scale-free networks, which implies that any infection will perpetually propagate regardless of the spreading rate. The vast majority of current theoretical approaches assumes that infections are transmitted as a reaction process from nodes to all neighbors. Here we adopt a different perspective and show that the epidemic incidence is shaped by traffic flow conditions. Specifically, we consider the scenario in which epidemic pathways are defined and driven by flows. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical predictions, it is shown that the value of the epidemic threshold in scale-free networks depends directly on flow conditions, in particular on the first and second moments of the betweenness distribution given a routing protocol. We consider the scenarios in which the delivery capability of the nodes is bounded or unbounded. In both cases, the threshold values depend on the traffic and decrease as flow increases. Bounded delivery provokes the emergence of congestion, slowing down the spreading of the disease and setting a limit for the epidemic incidence. Our results provide a general conceptual framework to understand spreading processes on complex networks.

010       Small world-Fractal Transition in Complex Networks: Renormalization   Group Approach
021       We show that renormalization group (RG) theory applied to complex networks are useful to classify network topologies into universality classes in the space of configurations. 
020       The RG flow readily identifies a small-world/fractal transition by finding (i) a trivial stable fixed point of a complete graph, (ii) a non-trivial point of a pure fractal topology that is stable or unstable according to the amount of long-range links in the network, and (iii) another stable point of a fractal with short-cuts that exists exactly at the small-world/fractal transition. As a collateral, the RG technique explains the coexistence of the seemingly contradicting fractal and small-world phases and allows to extract information on the distribution of short-cuts in real-world networks, a problem of importance for information flow in the system.

020       After obtaining of governing equations and considering the capillary pressuresaturation and permeability functions, the evolution of the model unknown parameters were obtained. In this way, using COMSOL (FEMLAB) and fluid flow/script Module, the role of heterogeneity in intrinsic permeability was analysed. Also, the evolution of relative permeability of wetting and non-wetting fluid, capillary pressure and other parameters were elicited. In the last part, a complex network approach to analysis of emerged patterns will be employed.

010       Consistent Community Identification in Complex Networks
021       We have found that known community identification algorithms produce inconsistent communities when the node ordering changes at input. 
020       We propose two metrics to quantify the level of consistency across multiple runs of an algorithm: pairwise membership probability and consistency. Based on these two metrics, we address the consistency problem without compromising the modularity. Our solution uses pairwise membership probabilities as link weights and generates consistent communities within six or fewer cycles. It offers a new tool in the study of community structures and their evolutions.

010       Strategies for Online Inference of Model-Based Clustering in large   Networks
021       The statistical analysis of complex networks is a challenging task, given that appropriate statistical models and efficient computational procedures are required in order for structures to be learned. 
020       One line of research has aimed at developing mixture models for random graphs, and this strategy has been successful in revealing structures in social and biological networks. The principle of these models is to assume that the distribution of the edge values follows a parametric distribution, conditionally on a latent structure which is used to detect connectivity patterns. However, these methods suffer from relatively slow estimation procedures, since dependencies are complex and do not necessarily allow for computational simplifications. In this paper we adapt online estimation strategies, originally developed for the EM algorithm, to the case of models for which the probability of the missing data conditionally on the available observations is not tractable. Our work focuses on two methods, the first based on the SAEM algorithm, and the second on variational methods. We perform a simulation to compare these two algorithms with existing approaches, and we use the method to decipher the structure of the US political websites network. We show that our online EM-based algorithms offer a good trade-off between precision and speed, when estimating parameters for mixture distributions in the context of random graphs.

010       Power law behavior associated with a Fibonacci Lucas model and   generalized statistical models
021       A Fibonacci-Lucas based statistical model and several other related models are studied. 
020       The canonical and grand canonical partition functions for these models are developed.Partition structure such as the distribution of sizes as in a cluster distribution is explored.Ensemble averaging over all partitions leads to a scale invariant power law behavior at a particular critical like point. The canonical ensemble of the Fibonacci-Lucas case involves the Gegenbauer polynomial.The model has a hyperbolic power law behavior, a feature linked to the golden mean ratio of two adjacent Fibonacci numbers and also the connection of Lucas numbers to the golden mean. The relation to other power law behavior, such as Zipf and Pareto laws, is mentioned. For the cases considered, the grand canonical ensemble involves the Gauss hypergeometric function F(a,b,c,z) with specific values for a,b,c. The general case has a variable power law behavior with tau exponent equal to1+c-a-b. An application with a=1/2, b=1, c=3 and thus tau=5/2 very closely approximates Bose-Einstein condensation. The zeta function zeta(3/2)=2.61 of the exact theory is replaced with 8/3 and zeta(5/2)= 1.34 with 4/3. At the condensation point the number of cycles of length falls as a scale invariant power law. The cycles, which arise from permutation symmetries associated with Bose-Einstein statistics, can be viewed as links in a complex network of connections between particles. This scale invariant power law parallels that seen in complex networks. The growth of the network is developed using recurrence properties of the model. Constraints imposed by the canonical ensemble and associates correlations lead to some number theoretic connections between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers as an incidental consequence of this approach.

010       Universal and nonuniversal allometric scaling behaviors in the   visibility graphs of world stock market indices
021       The investigations of financial markets from a complex network perspective have unveiled many phenomenological properties, in which the majority of these studies map the financial markets into one complex network. 
020       In this work, we investigate 30 world stock market indices through their visibility graphs by adopting the visibility algorithm to convert each single stock index into one visibility graph. A universal allometric scaling law is uncovered in the minimal spanning trees, whose scaling exponent is independent of the stock market and the length of the stock index. In contrast, the maximal spanning trees and the random spanning trees do not exhibit universal allometric scaling behaviors. There are marked discrepancies in the allometric scaling behaviors between the stock indices and the Brownian motions. Using surrogate time series, we find that these discrepancies are caused by the fat-tailedness of the return distribution, the nonlinear long-term correlation, and a coupling effect between these two influence factors.

010       Revising the simple measures of assortativity in complex networks
021       We find that traditional statistics for measuring degree mixing are strongly affected by superrich nodes. 
020       To counteract and measure the effect of superrich nodes, we propose a paradigm to quantify the mixing pattern of a real network in which different mixing patterns may appear among low-degree nodes and among high-degree nodes. The new paradigm and the simple revised measure uncover the true complex degree mixing patterns of complex networks with superrich nodes. The new method indicates that some networks show a false disassortative mixing induced by superrich nodes, and have no tendency to be genuinely disassortative. Our results also show that the previously observed fragility of scale-free networks is actually greatly exacerbated by the presence of even a very small number of superrich nodes.

010       Unevenness of Loop Location in Complex Networks
021       The loop structure plays an important role in many aspects of complex networks and attracts much attention. 
020       Among the previous works, Bianconi et al find that real networks often have fewer short loops as compared to random models. In this paper, we focus on the uneven location of loops which makes some parts of the network rich while some other parts sparse in loops. We propose a node removing process to analyze the unevenness and find rich loop cores can exist in many real networks such as neural networks and food web networks. Finally, an index is presented to quantify the unevenness of loop location in complex networks.

021       Clustering coefficient is an important topological feature of complex networks. 
020       It is, however, an open question to give out its analytic expression on weighted networks yet. Here we applied an extended mean-field approach to investigate clustering coefficients in the typical weighted networks proposed by Barrat, Barth\'elemy and Vespignani (BBV networks). We provide analytical solutions of this model and find that the local clustering in BBV networks depends on the node degree and strength. Our analysis is well in agreement with results of numerical simulations.

010       Steady-State Dynamics of the Forest Fire Model on Complex Networks
021       Many sociological networks, as well as biological and technological ones, can be represented in terms of complex networks with a heterogeneous connectivity pattern. 
020       Dynamical processes taking place on top of them can be very much influenced by this topological fact. In this paper we consider a paradigmatic model of non-equilibrium dynamics, namely the forest fire model, whose relevance lies in its capacity to represent several epidemic processes in a general parametrization. We study the behavior of this model in complex networks by developing the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field theory and solving it in its steady state. We provide exact and approximate expressions for homogeneous networks and several instances of heterogeneous networks. A comparison of our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations allows to draw the region of the parameter space in which heterogeneous mean-field theory provides an accurate description of the dynamics, and enlights the limits of validity of the mean-field theory in situations where dynamical correlations become important.

010       Mapping Complex Networks: Exploring Boolean Modeling of Signal   Transduction Pathways
021       In this study, we explored the utility of a descriptive and predictive bionetwork model for phospholipase C-coupled calcium signaling pathways, built with non-kinetic experimental information. 
020       Boolean models generated from these data yield oscillatory activity patterns for both the endoplasmic reticulum resident inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the plasma-membrane resident canonical transient receptor potential channel 3 (TRPC3). These results are specific as randomization of the Boolean operators ablates oscillatory pattern formation. Furthermore, knock-out simulations of the IP3R, TRPC3, and multiple other proteins recapitulate experimentally derived results. The potential of this approach can be observed by its ability to predict previously undescribed cellular phenotypes using in vitro experimental data. Indeed our cellular analysis of the developmental and calcium-regulatory protein, DANGER1a, confirms the counter-intuitive predictions from our Boolean models in two highly relevant cellular models. Based on these results, we theorize that with sufficient legacy knowledge and/or computational biology predictions, Boolean networks provide a robust method for predictive-modeling of any biological system.

010       Dynamical modeling of microRNA action on the protein translation process
021       Protein translation is a multistep process which can be represented as a cascade of biochemical reactions (initiation, ribosome assembly, elongation, etc.), the rate of which can be regulated by small non-coding microRNAs through multiple mechanisms. 
020       It remains unclear what mechanisms of microRNA action are most dominant: moreover, many experimental reports deliver controversal messages on what is the concrete mechanism actually observed in the experiment. Parker and Nissan (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008) demonstrated that it is impossible to distinguish alternative biological hypotheses using the steady state data on the rate of protein synthesis. For their analysis they used two simple kinetic models of protein translation. In contrary, we show that dynamical data allow to discriminate some of the mechanisms of microRNA action. We demonstrate this using the same models as in (Parker and Nissan, RNA, 2008) for the sake of comparison but the methods developed (asymptotology of biochemical networks) can be used for other models. As one of the results of our analysis, we formulate a hypothesis that the effect of microRNA action is measurable and observable only if it affects the dominant system (generalization of the limiting step notion for complex networks) of the protein translation machinery. The dominant system can vary in different experimental conditions that can partially explain the existing controversy of some of the experimental data.

010       Uncovering the community structure associated with the diffusion   dynamics of networks
021       As two main focuses of the study of complex networks, the community structure and the dynamics on networks have both attracted much attention from various scientific fields. 
020       However, it is still an open question how the community structure is associated with the dynamics on complex networks. In this article, through investigating the diffusion process taking place on networks, we demonstrate that the intrinsic community structure of networks can be revealed by the stable local equilibrium states of the diffusion process. Furthermore, we show that such community structure can be directly identified through the optimization of the conductance of network, which measures how easily the diffusion occurs among different communities. Tests on benchmark networks indicate that the conductance optimization method significantly outperforms the modularity optimization methods at identifying the community structure of networks. Applications on real world networks also demonstrate the effectiveness of the conductance optimization method. This work provides insights into the multiple topological scales of complex networks, and the obtained community structure can naturally reflect the diffusion capability of the underlying network.

010       Optimal map of the modular structure of complex networks
021       Modular structure is pervasive in many complex networks of interactions observed in natural, social and technological sciences. 
020       Its study sheds light on the relation between the structure and function of complex systems. Generally speaking, modules are islands of highly connected nodes separated by a relatively small number of links. Every module can have contributions of links from any node in the network. The challenge is to disentangle these contributions to understand how the modular structure is built. The main problem is that the analysis of a certain partition into modules involves, in principle, as many data as number of modules times number of nodes. To confront this challenge, here we first define the contribution matrix, the mathematical object containing all the information about the partition of interest, and after, we use a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition to extract the best representation of this matrix in a plane. The analysis of this projection allow us to scrutinize the architecture of the modular structure, revealing the structure of individual modules and their interrelations.

021       We investigate a functional definition of community structure in complex networks. 
020       In particular, we consider networks whose function is enhanced by the ability to synchronize and/or by resilience to node failures. Previous work has shown that the largest eigenvalue of the network's adjacency matrix provides insight into both synchronization and percolation processes. Thus, for networks whose goal is to perform these functions, we propose a method that divides a given network into communities based on maximizing the largest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of the resulting communities.

010       Musical Genres: Beating to the Rhythms of Different Drums
021       Online music databases have increased signicantly as a consequence of the rapid growth of the Internet and digital audio, requiring the development of faster and more efficient tools for music content analysis. 
020       Musical genres are widely used to organize music collections. In this paper, the problem of automatic music genre classification is addressed by exploring rhythm-based features obtained from a respective complex network representation. A Markov model is build in order to analyse the temporal sequence of rhythmic notation events. Feature analysis is performed by using two multivariate statistical approaches: principal component analysis(unsupervised) and linear discriminant analysis (supervised). Similarly, two classifiers are applied in order to identify the category of rhythms: parametric Bayesian classifier under gaussian hypothesis (supervised), and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (unsupervised). Qualitative results obtained by Kappa coefficient and the obtained clusters corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

010       Network Structure, Self-Organization and the Growth of International   Collaboration in Science
021       Using data from co-authorships at the international level in all fields of science in 1990 and 2000, and within six case studies at the sub-field level in 2000, different explanations for the growth of international collaboration in science and technology are explored. 
020       We find that few of the explanations within the literature can be supported by a detailed review of the data. To enable further exploration of the role of recognition and rewards as ordering mechanisms within the system, we apply new tools emerging from network science. These enquiries shows that the growth of international co-authorships can be attributed to self-organizing phenomenon based on preferential attachment (searching for recognition and reward) within networks of co-authors. The co-authorship links can be considered as a complex network with sub-dynamics involving features of both competition and cooperation. The analysis suggests that the growth of international collaboration is more likely to emerge from dynamics at the sub-field level operating in all fields of science, albeit under institutional constraints. Implications for the management of global scientific collaborations are explored.

010       Community landscapes: an integrative approach to determine overlapping   network module hierarchy, identify key nodes and predict network dynamics
021       Network communities help the functional organization and evolution of complex networks. 
020       However, the development of a method, which is both fast and accurate, provides modular overlaps and partitions of a heterogeneous network, was rather difficult. Here we introduce the novel concept of community landscapes and ModuLand, an integrative framework determining overlapping network modules as hills of the community landscape and including several widely used modularization methods as special cases. The current implementations of the community landscape concept provide a fast analysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine overlapping modules with a high resolution; (2) uncover a hierarchical network structure in previously unprecedented details allowing a fast, zoom-in analysis of large networks; (3) allow the determination of key network elements and (4) help to predict network dynamics. The concept opens a wide range of possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network routing, classification, comparison and prediction.

021       The disease spreading on complex networks is studied in SIR model. 
020       Simulations on empirical complex networks reveal two specific regimes of disease spreading: local containment and epidemic outbreak. The variables measuring the extent of disease spreading are in general characterized by a bimodal probability distribution. Phase diagrams of disease spreading for empirical complex networks are introduced. A theoretical model of disease spreading on m-ary tree is investigated both analytically and in simulations. It is shown that the model reproduces qualitative features of phase diagrams of disease spreading observed in empirical complex networks. The role of tree-like structure of complex networks in disease spreading is discussed.

010       Search for overlapped communities by parallel genetic algorithms
021       In the last decade the broad scope of complex networks has led to a rapid progress. 
020       In this area a particular interest has the study of community structures. The analysis of this type of structure requires the formalization of the intuitive concept of community and the definition of indices of goodness for the obtained results. A lot of algorithms has been presented to reach this goal. In particular, an interesting problem is the search of overlapped communities and it is field seems very interesting a solution based on the use of genetic algorithms. The approach discusses in this paper is based on a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm and shows the performance benefits of this solution.

010       Understanding edge-connectivity in the Internet through   core-decomposition
021       Internet is a complex network composed by several networks: the Autonomous Systems, each one designed to transport information efficiently. 
020       Routing protocols aim to find paths between nodes whenever it is possible (i.e., the network is not partitioned), or to find paths verifying specific constraints (e.g., a certain QoS is required). As connectivity is a measure related to both of them (partitions and selected paths) this work provides a formal lower bound to it based on core-decomposition, under certain conditions, and low complexity algorithms to find it. We apply them to analyze maps obtained from the prominent Internet mapping projects, using the LaNet-vi open-source software for its visualization.

010       Robustness of Regular Graphs Based on Natural Connectivity
021       It has been recently proposed that the natural connectivity can be used to characterize efficiently the robustness of complex networks. 
020       The natural connectivity quantifies the redundancy of alternative routes in the network by evaluating the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths and can be seen as an average eigenvalue obtained from the graph spectrum. In this paper, we explore both analytically and numerically the natural connectivity of regular ring lattices and regular random graphs obtained through degree-preserving random rewirings from regular ring lattices. We reformulate the natural connectivity of regular ring lattices in terms of generalized Bessel functions and show that the natural connectivity of regular ring lattices is independent of network size and increases with monotonically. We also show that random regular graphs have lower natural connectivity, and are thus less robust, than regular ring lattices.

010       Dynamical organization towards cultural consensus in complex networks
021       We analyze the dynamics towards cultural consensus in the Axelrod model on scale-free networks. 
020       By looking at the microscopic dynamics of the model, we are able to show how culture traits spread across different cultural features. We compare the diffusion at the level of cultural features to the growth of cultural consensus at the global level, finding important differences between these two processes. In particular, we show that even when most of the cultural features have reached macroscopic consensus, there are still no signals of globalization. Finally, we analyze the topology of consensus clusters both for global culture and at the feature level of representation.

010       Power laws of the in-degree and out-degree distributions of complex   networks
021       A model for directed networks is proposed and power laws for their in-degree and/or out-degree distributions are derived from the model. 
020       It is based on the Barabasi-Albert model and contains two parameters. The parameters serve as regulatory factors for the contributions of new nodes through in- and out-degrees. The model allows a newly added link to connect directly two nodes already present in the network. Such a link is called an inner link, while a link attached to a new node is called an outer link. Using relationships between inner and outer links, we investigate power laws for in- and out-degree distributions of directed networks. This model enables us to predict some interesting features of directed networks; in particular, the World Wide Web and the networks of citation and phone-call.

010       NetEvo: A computational framework for the evolution of dynamical complex   networks
021       NetEvo is a computational framework designed to help understand the evolution of dynamical complex networks. 
020       It provides flexible tools for the simulation of dynamical processes on networks and methods for the evolution of underlying topological structures. The concept of a supervisor is used to bring together both these aspects in a coherent way. It is the job of the supervisor to rewire the network topology and alter model parameters such that a user specified performance measure is minimised. This performance measure can make use of current topological information and simulated dynamical output from the system. Such an abstraction provides a suitable basis in which to study many outstanding questions related to complex system design and evolution.

010       Mechanical response of a self avoiding membrane: fold collisions and the   birth of conical singularities
021       An elastic membrane that is forced to reside in a container smaller than its natural size will deform and, upon further volume reduction, eventually crumple. 
020       The crumpled state is characterized by the localization of energy in a complex network of highly deformed crescent-like regions joined by line ridges. Previous studies have focused on the onset of the crumpled state by analyzing the mechanical response and stability of a conical dislocation, while others have simulated the highly packed regime neglecting the importance of the connectivity of the membrane. Here we show, through a combination of experiments, numerical simulations, and analytic approach, that the emergence of new regions of high stretching is a generic outcome when a self avoiding membrane is subject to a severe geometrical constraint. We demonstrate that, at moderate packing fraction, interlayer interactions produce a response equivalent to the one of a thicker membrane that has the shape of the deformed one. Evidence is found that friction plays a key role stabilizing the folded structures.

010       How clustering affects the bond percolation threshold in complex   networks
021       The question of how clustering (non-zero density of triangles) in networks affects their bond percolation threshold has important applications in a variety of disciplines. 
020       Recent advances in modelling highly-clustered networks are employed here to analytically study the bond percolation threshold. In comparison to the threshold in an unclustered network with the same degree distribution and correlation structure, the presence of triangles in these model networks is shown to lead to a larger bond percolation threshold (i.e. clustering \emph{increases} the epidemic threshold or \emph{decreases} resilience of the network to random edge deletion).

010       A Vibrational Approach to Node Centrality and Vulnerability in Complex   Networks
021       We propose a new measure of vulnerability of a node in a complex network. 
020       The measure is based on the analogy in which the nodes of the network are represented by balls and the links are identified with springs. We define the measure as the node displacement, or the amplitude of vibration of each node, under fluctuation due to the thermal bath in which the network is supposed to be submerged. We prove exact relations among the thus defined node displacement, the information centrality and the Kirchhoff index. The relation between the first two suggests that the node displacement has a better resolution of the vulnerability than the information centrality, because the latter is the sum of the local node displacement and the node displacement averaged over the entire network.

010       Planar unclustered scale-free graphs as models for technological and   biological networks
021       Many real life networks present an average path length logarithmic with the number of nodes and a degree distribution which follows a power law. 
020       Often these networks have also a modular and self-similar structure and, in some cases - usually associated with topological restrictions- their clustering is low and they are almost planar. In this paper we introduce a family of graphs which share all these properties and are defined by two parameters. As their construction is deterministic, we obtain exact analytic expressions for relevant properties of the graphs including the degree distribution, degree correlation, diameter, and average distance, as a function of the two defining parameters. Thus, the graphs are useful to model some complex networks, in particular several families of technological and biological networks, and in the design of new practical communication algorithms in relation to their dynamical processes. They can also help understanding the underlying mechanisms that have produced their particular structure.

010       Edge Partitions and Overlapping Communities in Complex Networks
021       In this paper, we develop the idea to partition the edges of a graph in order to uncover overlapping communities of its nodes. 
020       Our approach is based on the construction of different types of weighted line graphs, i.e. graphs whose nodes are the links of the original graph, that encapsulate differently the relations between the edges. Weighted line graphs are argued to provide an alternative, valuable representation of the system's topology, and are shown to have important applications in community detection, as the usual node partition of a line graph naturally leads to an edge partition of the original graph. This identification allows us to use traditional partitioning methods in order to address the long-standing problem of the detection of overlapping communities. We generalise our approach to weighted graphs and apply it to the analysis of different social and geographical networks.

020       It is found that the statistical physics of this model makes it an appropriate representation of the Boltzmann statistics in the context of complex networks. The phase transition of this extended model is illustrated with numerical simulation and the corresponding "critical temperature" $T_c$ is identified. We note that the "non-condensation phase" in $T &gt; T_c$ regime is different with "fit-get-rich" (FGR) phase of B-B model and that the connectivity degree distribution P(k) deviates from power-law distribution at given temperatures.

010       Complexity Analysis of Unsaturated Flow in Heterogeneous Media Using a   Complex Network Approach
021       In this study, we investigate the complexity of two-phase flow (air/water) in a heterogeneous soil sample by using complex network theory, where the supposed porous media is non-deformable media, under the time-dependent gas pressure. 
020       Based on the different similarity measurements (i.e., correlation, Euclidean metrics) over the emerged patterns from the evolution of saturation of non-wetting phase of a multi-heterogeneous soil sample, the emerged complex networks are recognized. Understanding of the properties of complex networks (such degree distribution, mean path length, clustering coefficient) can be supposed as a way to analysis of variation of saturation profiles structures (as the solution of finite element method on the coupled PDEs) where complexity is coming from the changeable connection and links between assumed nodes. Also, the path of evolution of the supposed system will be illustrated on the state space of networks either in correlation and Euclidean measurements. The results of analysis showed in a closed system the designed complex networks approach to small world network where the mean path length and clustering coefficient are low and high, respectively. As another result, the evolution of macro -states of system (such mean velocity of air or pressure) can be scaled with characteristics of structure complexity of saturation. In other part, we tried to find a phase transition criterion based on the variation of non-wetting phase velocity profiles over a network which had been constructed over correlation distance.

010       On the pinning strategy of complex networks
021       In pinning control of complex networks, a tacit believing is that the system dynamics will be better controlled by pinning the large-degree nodes than the small-degree ones. 
020       Here, by changing the number of pinned nodes, we find that, when a significant fraction of the network nodes are pinned, pinning the small-degree nodes could generally have a higher performance than pinning the large-degree nodes. We demonstrate this interesting phenomenon on a variety of complex networks, and analyze the underlying mechanisms by the model of star networks. By changing the network properties, we also find that, comparing to densely connected homogeneous networks, the advantage of the small-degree pinning strategy is more distinct in sparsely connected heterogenous networks.

010       Approximating Spectral Impact of Structural Perturbations in Large   Networks
021       Determining the effect of structural perturbations on the eigenvalue spectra of networks is an important problem because the spectra characterize not only their topological structures, but also their dynamical behavior, such as synchronization and cascading processes on networks. 
020       Here we develop a theory for estimating the change of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix or the extreme eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian when small but arbitrary set of links are added or removed from the network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximation schemes using both real and artificial networks, showing in particular that we can accurately obtain the spectral ranking of small subgraphs. We also propose a local iterative scheme which computes the relative ranking of a subgraph using only the connectivity information of its neighbors within a few links. Our results may not only contribute to our theoretical understanding of dynamical processes on networks, but also lead to practical applications in ranking subgraphs of real complex networks.

010       The complex network of global cargo ship movements
021       Transportation networks play a crucial role in human mobility, the exchange of goods, and the spread of invasive species. 
020       With 90% of world trade carried by sea, the global network of merchant ships provides one of the most important modes of transportation. Here we use information about the itineraries of 16,363 cargo ships during the year 2007 to construct a network of links between ports. We show that the network has several features which set it apart from other transportation networks. In particular, most ships can be classified in three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analyzed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade and bioinvasion.

021       Robustness is an important property of complex networks. 
020       Up to now, there are plentiful researches focusing on the network's robustness containing error and attack tolerance of network's connectivity and the shortest path. In this paper, the error and attack tolerance of network's community structure are studies through randomly and purposely disturbing interaction of networks. Two purposely perturbation methods are designed, that one methods is based on cluster coefficient and the other is attacking triangle. Dissimilarity function D is used to quantify the changes of community structure and modularity Q is used to quantify the significance of community structure. The numerical results show that after perturbation, network's community structure is damaged to be more unclear. It is also discovered that purposely attacking damages more to the community structure than randomly attacking.

010       Structure and control of self-sustained target waves in excitable   small-world networks
021       Small-world networks describe many important practical systems among which neural networks consisting of excitable nodes are the most typical ones. 
020       In this paper we study self-sustained oscillations of target waves in excitable small-world networks. A novel dominant phase-advanced driving (DPAD) method, which is generally applicable for analyzing all oscillatory complex networks consisting of nonoscillatory nodes, is proposed to reveal the self-organized structures supporting this type of oscillations. The DPAD method explicitly explores the oscillation sources and wave propagation paths of the systems, which are otherwise deeply hidden in the complicated patterns of randomly distributed target groups. Based on the understanding of the self-organized structure, the oscillatory patterns can be controlled with extremely high efficiency.

010       Local transition gradients determine the global attributes of protein   energy landscapes
021       The dynamical characterization of proteins is crucial to understand protein function. 
020       From a microscopic point of view, protein dynamics is governed by the local atomic interactions that, in turn, trigger the functional conformational changes. Unfortunately, the relationship between local atomic fluctuations and global protein rearrangements is still elusive. Here, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with complex network analysis show that fast peptide relaxations effectively build the backbone of the global free-energy landscape, providing a connection between local and global atomic rearrangements. A minimum-spanning-tree representation, built on the base of transition gradients networks, results in a high resolution mapping of the system dynamics and thermodynamics without requiring any a priori knowledge of the relevant degrees of freedom. These results suggest the presence of a local mechanism for the high communication efficiency generally observed in complex systems.

010       Ambiguities in recurrence-based complex network representations of time   series
021       Recently, different approaches have been proposed for studying basic properties of time series from a complex network perspective. 
020       In this work, the corresponding potentials and limitations of networks based on recurrences in phase space are investigated in some detail. We discuss the main requirements that permit a feasible system-theoretic interpretation of network topology in terms of dynamically invariant phase-space properties. Possible artifacts induced by disregarding these requirements are pointed out and systematically studied. Finally, a rigorous interpretation of the clustering coefficient and the betweenness centrality in terms of invariant objects is proposed.

010       Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks
021       Networks portray a multitude of interactions through which people meet, ideas are spread, and infectious diseases propagate within a society. 
020       Identifying the most efficient "spreaders" in a network is an important step to optimize the use of available resources and ensure the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, the most influential spreaders in a social network do not correspond to the best connected people or to the most central people (high betweenness centrality). Instead, we find: (i) The most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis. (ii) When multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously, the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extend of the spreading. Furthermore, we find that-- in the case of infections that do not confer immunity on recovered individuals-- the infection persists in the high k-shell layers of the network under conditions where hubs may not be able to preserve the infection. Our analysis provides a plausible route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies.

010       Modularity map of the network of human cell differentiation
021       Cell differentiation in multicellular organisms is a complex process whose mechanism can be understood by a reductionist approach, in which the individual processes that control the generation of different cell types are identified. 
020       Alternatively, a large scale approach in search of different organizational features of the growth stages promises to reveal its modular global structure with the goal of discovering previously unknown relations between cell types. Here we sort and analyze a large set of scattered data to construct the network of human cell differentiation (NHCD) based on cell types (nodes) and differentiation steps (links) from the fertilized egg to a crying baby. We discover a dynamical law of critical branching, which reveals a fractal regularity in the modular organization of the network, and allows us to observe the network at different scales. The emerging picture clearly identifies clusters of cell types following a hierarchical organization, ranging from sub-modules to super-modules of specialized tissues and organs on varying scales. This discovery will allow one to treat the development of a particular cell function in the context of the complex network of human development as a whole. Our results point to an integrated large-scale view of the network of cell types systematically revealing ties between previously unrelated domains in organ functions.

010       Complex networks: new trends for the analysis of brain connectivity
021       Today, the human brain can be studied as a whole. 
020       Electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, or functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques provide functional connectivity patterns between different brain areas, and during different pathological and cognitive neuro-dynamical states. In this Tutorial we review novel complex networks approaches to unveil how brain networks can efficiently manage local processing and global integration for the transfer of information, while being at the same time capable of adapting to satisfy changing neural demands.

010       Agent Based Models of Language Competition: Macroscopic descriptions and   Order-Disorder transitions
021       We investigate the dynamics of two agent based models of language competition. 
020       In the first model, each individual can be in one of two possible states, either using language $X$ or language $Y$, while the second model incorporates a third state XY, representing individuals that use both languages (bilinguals). We analyze the models on complex networks and two-dimensional square lattices by analytical and numerical methods, and show that they exhibit a transition from one-language dominance to language coexistence. We find that the coexistence of languages is more difficult to maintain in the Bilinguals model, where the presence of bilinguals in use facilitates the ultimate dominance of one of the two languages. A stability analysis reveals that the coexistence is more unlikely to happen in poorly-connected than in fully connected networks, and that the dominance of only one language is enhanced as the connectivity decreases. This dominance effect is even stronger in a two-dimensional space, where domain coarsening tends to drive the system towards language consensus.

010       Estimating and Sampling Graphs with Multidimensional Random Walks
021       Estimating characteristics of large graphs via sampling is a vital part of the study of complex networks. 
020       Current sampling methods such as (independent) random vertex and random walks are useful but have drawbacks. Random vertex sampling may require too many resources (time, bandwidth, or money). Random walks, which normally require fewer resources per sample, can suffer from large estimation errors in the presence of disconnected or quasi-disconnected subgraphs. In this work we propose a new $m$-dimensional random walk that uses $m$ dependent random walkers. We prove that the proposed sampling method, which we call Frontier sampling, has all of the nice sampling properties of a regular random walk. At the same time, our simulations over large real world graphs show that, in the presence of disconnected or quasi-disconnected subgraphs, Frontier sampling exhibits lower estimation errors than regular random walks. We also argue that Frontier sampling is more suitable to sample power-law graphs than random vertex sampling.

010       Detecting highly overlapping community structure by greedy clique   expansion
021       In complex networks it is common for each node to belong to several communities, implying a highly overlapping community structure. 
020       Recent advances in benchmarking indicate that existing community assignment algorithms, capable of detecting overlapping communities, perform well only when the extent of community overlap is kept to modest levels. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new community assignment algorithm called Greedy Clique Expansion (GCE). The algorithm identifies distinct cliques as seeds and expands these seeds by greedily optimizing a local fitness function. We perform extensive benchmarks on synthetic data to demonstrate that GCE's good performance is robust across diverse graph topologies. Significantly, GCE is the only algorithm to perform well on these synthetic graphs, in which every node belongs to multiple communities. Furthermore, when put to the task of identifying functional modules in protein interaction data, and college dorm assignments in Facebook friendship data, we find that GCE performs competitively.

010       How to Measure Significance of Community Structure in Complex Networks
021       Community structure analysis is a powerful tool for complex networks, which can simplify their functional analysis considerably. 
020       Recently, many approaches were proposed to community structure detection, but few works were focused on the significance of community structure. Since real networks obtained from complex systems always contain error links, and most of the community detection algorithms have random factors, evaluate the significance of community structure is important and urgent. In this paper, we use the eigenvectors' stability to characterize the significance of community structures. By employing the eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of a given network, we can evaluate the significance of its community structure and obtain the optimal number of communities, which are always hard for community detection algorithms. We apply our method to many real networks. We find that significant community structures exist in many social networks and C.elegans neural network, and that less significant community structures appear in protein-interaction networks and metabolic networks. Our method can be applied to broad clustering problems in data mining due to its solid mathematical basis and efficiency.

010       The backbone of the climate network
021       We propose a method to reconstruct and analyze a complex network from data generated by a spatio-temporal dynamical system, relying on the nonlinear mutual information of time series analysis and betweenness centrality of complex network theory. 
020       We show, that this approach reveals a rich internal structure in complex climate networks constructed from reanalysis and model surface air temperature data. Our novel method uncovers peculiar wave-like structures of high energy flow, that we relate to global surface ocean currents. This points to a major role of the oceanic surface circulation in coupling and stabilizing the global temperature field in the long term mean (140 years for the model run and 60 years for reanalysis data). We find that these results cannot be obtained using classical linear methods of multivariate data analysis, and have ensured their robustness by intensive significance testing.

010       Public Transport Networks under Random Failure and Directed Attack
021       The behaviour of complex networks under failure or attack depends strongly on the specific scenario. 
020       Of special interest are scale-free networks, which are usually seen as robust under random failure but appear to be especially vulnerable to targeted attacks. In a recent study of public transport networks of 14 major cities of the world we have shown that these systems when represented by appropriate graphs may exhibit scale-free behaviour. In this paper we briefly review some of the recent results about the effects that defunct or removed nodes have on the properties of public transport networks. Simulating different directed attack strategies, we derive vulnerability criteria that result in minimal strategies with high impact on these systems.

010       Stability and chaos in coupled two-dimensional maps on Gene Regulatory   Network of bacterium E.Coli
021       The collective dynamics of coupled two-dimensional chaotic maps on complex networks is known to exhibit a rich variety of emergent properties which crucially depend on the underlying network topology. 
020       We investigate the collective motion of Chirikov standard maps interacting with time delay through directed links of Gene Regulatory Network of bacterium Escherichia Coli. Departures from strongly chaotic behavior of the isolated maps are studied in relation to different coupling forms and strengths. At smaller coupling intensities the network induces stable and coherent emergent dynamics. The unstable behavior appearing with increase of coupling strength remains confined within a connected sub-network. For the appropriate coupling, network exhibits statistically robust self-organized dynamics in a weakly chaotic regime.

010       The entropic origin of disassortativity in complex networks
021       Why are most empirical networks, with the prominent exception of social ones, generically degree-degree anticorrelated, i.e. 
020       disassortative? With a view to answering this long-standing question, we define a general class of degree-degree correlated networks and obtain the associated Shannon entropy as a function of parameters. It turns out that the maximum entropy does not typically correspond to uncorrelated networks, but to either assortative (correlated) or disassortative (anticorrelated) ones. More specifically, for highly heterogeneous (scale-free) networks, the maximum entropy principle usually leads to disassortativity, providing a parsimonious explanation to the question above. Furthermore, by comparing the correlations measured in some real-world networks with those yielding maximum entropy for the same degree sequence, we find a remarkable agreement in various cases. Our approach provides a neutral model from which, in the absence of further knowledge regarding network evolution, one can obtain the expected value of correlations. In cases in which empirical observations deviate from the neutral predictions -- as happens in social networks -- one can then infer that there are specific correlating mechanisms at work.

010       Dynamical influence: how to measure individual contributions to   collective dynamics in complex networks
021       Identifying key players in complex networks remains a challenge affecting a great variety of research fields, from the efficient dissemination of ideas to drug target discovery in biomedical problems. 
020       The difficulty lies at several levels: how to single out the role of individual elements in such intermingled systems, or which is the best way to quantify their importance. Centrality measures aim at capturing the influence of a node from its position in a network. The key issue obviated is that the contribution of a node to the collective behaviour is not uniquely determined by the structure of the system but a result of both dynamics and network structure. Here we define dynamical influence as an explicit measure of how strongly a node's dynamical state affects collective behavior. Influence is derived analytically for dissipative processes in complex networks, directed or undirected. We show that it quantifies precisely how efficiently real systems may be driven by manipulating the state of single nodes. It stands out as a high quality score to target influential drivers in real networks.

We particularize on the disease spreading dynamics on top of static and growing adaptive networks. Our results accurately reproduce those obtained by extensive numerical simulations showing a large improvement with respect to the usual heterogeneous mean-field formulation. Apart from fast and reliable, the annealed dynamics constitutes an unifying framework for the study of dynamical processes on networks and complex adaptive systems.

010       Horizontal visibility graphs: exact results for random time series
021       The visibility algorithm has been recently introduced as a mapping between time series and complex networks. 
020       This procedure allows to apply methods of complex network theory for characterizing time series. In this work we present the horizontal visibility algorithm, a geometrically simpler and analytically solvable version of our former algorithm, focusing on the mapping of random series (series of independent identically distributed random variables). After presenting some properties of the algorithm, we present exact results on the topological properties of graphs associated to random series, namely the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean path length. We show that the horizontal visibility algorithm stands as a simple method to discriminate randomness in time series, since any random series maps to a graph with an exponential degree distribution of the shape P(k) = (1/3)(2/3)**(k-2), independently of the probability distribution from which the series was generated. Accordingly, visibility graphs with other P(k) are related to non-random series. Numerical simulations confirm the accuracy of the theorems for finite series. In a second part, we show that the method is able to distinguish chaotic series from i.i.d. theory, studying the following situations: (i) noise-free low-dimensional chaotic series, (ii) low-dimensional noisy chaotic series, even in the presence of large amounts of noise, and (iii) high-dimensional chaotic series (coupled map lattice), without needs for additional techniques such as surrogate data or noise reduction methods. Finally, heuristic arguments are given to explain the topological properties of chaotic series and several sequences which are conjectured to be random are analyzed.

010       A Condition for Cooperation in a Game on Complex Networks
021       We study a condition of favoring cooperation in a prisoner's dilemma game on complex networks. 
020       There are two kinds of players: cooperators and defectors. Cooperators pay a benefit b to their neighbors at a cost c, while defectors only receive benefit. The game is done under weak selection and death-birth update. Although it has been well recognized that b/c&gt; &lt;k&gt; is the condition of favoring cooperation, we find that b/c&gt; &lt;knn&gt; is a much better approximate condition. We also show that among the representative networks-regular, random, and scale free-a regular network favors cooperation the most, while a scale-free network favors it the least. In an ideal scale-free network, cooperation is unfeasible. Whether a scale-free network favors cooperation depends on the details of the games.

010       Nonlinear Accelerator Lattices with One and Two Analytic Invariants
021       Integrable systems appeared in physics long ago at the onset of classical dynamics with examples being Kepler's and other famous problems. 
020       Unfortunately, the majority of nonlinear problems turned out to be nonintegrable. In accelerator terms, any 2D nonlinear nonintegrable mapping produces chaotic motion and a complex network of stable and unstable resonances. Nevertheless, in the proximity of an integrable system the full volume of such a chaotic network is small. Thus, the integrable nonlinear motion in accelerators has the potential to introduce a large betatron tune spread to suppress instabilities and to mitigate the effects of space charge and magnetic field errors. To create such an accelerator lattice one has to find magnetic and electrtic field combinations leading to a stable integrable motion. This paper presents families of lattices with one invariant where bounded motion can be easily created in large volumes of the phase space. In addition, it presents 3 families of integrable nonlinear accelerator lattices, realizable with longitudinal-coordinate-dependent magnetic or electric fields with the stable nonlinear motion, which can be solved in terms of separable variables.

010       Measuring degree-degree association in networks
021       Pearson's $\rho_p$ is commonly used for quantifying the global level of degree-degree correlations in complex networks. 
020       In this paper we show that for networks with a heavy-tailed degree distribution $\rho_p$ is strongly diverging with an increasing maximum node degree. This behavior impedes a systematic comparison of degree-correlated networks with different sizes. In order to overcome this problem, we propose the use of Kendall-Gibbons $\tau_{b}$ for quantifying the global level of degree-degree correlations, as this measure is considerably more robust with respect to the network size.

010       Distributed quantum computation with arbitrarily poor photon detection
021       In a distributed quantum computer scalability is accomplished by networking together many elementary nodes. 
020       Typically the network is optical and inter-node entanglement involves photon detection. In complex networks the entanglement fidelity may be degraded by the twin problems of photon loss and dark counts. Here we describe an entanglement protocol which can achieve high fidelity even when these issues are arbitrarily severe; indeed the method succeeds with finite probability even if the detectors are entirely removed from the network. An experimental demonstration should be possible with existing technologies.

010       The Evolution of Communication Systems
021       One can study communications by using Shannon's (1948) mathematical theory of communication. 
020       In social communications, however, the channels are not "fixed", but themselves subject to change. Communication systems change by communicating information to related communication systems; co-variation among systems if repeated over time, can lead to co-evolution. Conditions for stabilization of higher-order systems are specifiable: segmentation, stratification, differentiation, reflection, and self-organization can be distinguished in terms of developmental stages of increasingly complex networks. In addition to natural and cultural evolution, a condition for the artificial evolution of communication systems can be specified.

010       The Non-linear Dynamics of Sociological Reflections
021       Actors are embedded in networks of communication: the relations of the actors can be represented as the rows of a matrix, while the column vectors represent their communications. 
020       The two systems are structurally coupled in the co-variation: each action can be considered as a communication with reference to the network. Co-variation among systems if repeated over time, may lead to co-evolution. Conditions for stabilization of higher-order systems are specifiable: segmentation, stratification, reflection, differentiation, and self-organization can be distinguished in terms of developmental stages of increasingly complex networks. The sociological theory of communication occupies a central position for the clarification of the possibility of a general theory of communication, since it confronts us with the limits of reflexivity in human understanding and reflexive discourse. The implications for modelling the relations among incommensurable discourses (e.g., paradigms) are elaborated.

010       Stabilization of biodiversity in the coevolutionary rock-paper-scissors   game on complex networks
021       The dynamical mechanisms that can stabilize the coexistence of species (or strategies) are of substantial interest for the maintenance of biodiversity and in sociobehavioural dynamics. 
020       We investigate the mean extinction time in the coevolutionary dynamics of three cyclically invading strategies for different evolutionary processes on various classes of complex networks, including random graphs, scale-free and small world networks. We find that scale-free and random graphs lead to a strong stabilization of coexistence both for the Moran process and the Local Update process. The stabilization is of an order of magnitude stronger compared to a lattice topology, and is mainly caused by the degree heterogeneity of the graph. However, evolutionary processes on graphs can be defined in many variants, and we show that in a process using effective payoffs the effect of the network topology can be completely reversed. Thus, stabilization of coexistence depends on both network geometry and underlying evolutionary process.

010       Beyond the average: Detecting global singular nodes from local features   in complex networks
021       Deviations from the average can provide valuable insights about the organization of natural systems. 
020       The present article extends this important principle to the systematic identification and analysis of singular motifs in complex networks. Six measurements quantifying different and complementary features of the connectivity around each node of a network were calculated, and multivariate statistical methods applied to identify singular nodes. The potential of the presented concepts and methodology was illustrated with respect to different types of complex real-world networks, namely the US air transportation network, the protein-protein interactions of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Roget thesaurus networks. The obtained singular motifs possessed unique functional roles in the networks. Three classic theoretical network models were also investigated, with the Barab\'asi-Albert model resulting in singular motifs corresponding to hubs, confirming the potential of the approach. Interestingly, the number of different types of singular node motifs as well as the number of their instances were found to be considerably higher in the real-world networks than in any of the benchmark networks.

010       Identification of Starting Points in Sampling of Complex Networks
021       Because of their large size, several real-world complex networks can only be represented and computationally handled in a sampled version. 
020       One of the most common sampling schemes is breadth-first where, after starting from a given node, its neighbors are taken, and then the neighbors of neighbors, and so on. Therefore, it becomes an important issue, given a specific network sampled by the breadth-first method, to try to identify the original node. In addition to providing a clue about how the sampling was performed, the identification of the original node also paves the way for the reconstruction of the sampling dynamics provided the original networks is available. In the current article, we propose and validate a new and effective methodology for the identification of the original nodes. The method is based on the calculation of the accessibility of the nodes in the sampled network. We show that the original node tends to have the highest values of accessibility. The potential of the methodology is illustrated with respect to three theoretical complex networks model as well as a real-world network, namely the United States patent network.

010       Parallel Generation of Massive Scale-Free Graphs
021       One of the biggest huddles faced by researchers studying algorithms for massive graphs is the lack of large input graphs that are essential for the development and test of the graph algorithms. 
020       This paper proposes two efficient and highly scalable parallel graph generation algorithms that can produce massive realistic graphs to address this issue. The algorithms, designed to achieve high degree of parallelism by minimizing inter-processor communications, are two of the fastest graph generators which are capable of generating scale-free graphs with billions of vertices and edges. The synthetic graphs generated by the proposed methods possess the most common properties of real complex networks such as power-law degree distribution, small-worldness, and communities-within-communities. Scalability was tested on a large cluster at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. In the experiment, we were able to generate a graph with 1 billion vertices and 5 billion edges in less than 13 seconds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest synthetic scale-free graph reported in the literature.

010       Cellular Automata Networks
021       A small-world cellular automaton network has been formulated to simulate the long-range interactions of complex networks using unconventional computing methods in this paper. 
020       Conventional cellular automata use local updating rules. The new type of cellular automata networks uses local rules with a fraction of long-range shortcuts derived from the properties of small-world networks. Simulations show that the self-organized criticality emerges naturally in the system for a given probability of shortcuts and transition occurs as the probability increases to some critical value indicating the small-world behaviour of the complex automata networks. Pattern formation of cellular automata networks and the comparison with equation-based reaction-diffusion systems are also discussed

010       Bootstrap Percolation on Complex Networks
021       We consider bootstrap percolation on uncorrelated complex networks. 
020       We obtain the phase diagram for this process with respect to two parameters: $f$, the fraction of vertices initially activated, and $p$, the fraction of undamaged vertices in the graph. We observe two transitions: the giant active component appears continuously at a first threshold. There may also be a second, discontinuous, hybrid transition at a higher threshold. Avalanches of activations increase in size as the critical point is approached, finally diverging at this threshold. We describe the existence of a special critical point at which this second transition first appears. In networks with degree distributions whose second moment diverges, we find a qualitatively different behavior. In this case the giant active component appears for any $f&gt;0$ and $p&gt;0$, and the discontinuous transition is absent. This means that the giant active component is robust to damage, and also is very easily activated. We also formulate a generalized bootstrap process in which each vertex can have an arbitrary threshold.

010       Dark mammoth trunks in the merging galaxy NGC 1316 and a mechanism of   cosmic double helices
021       NGC 1316 is a giant, elliptical galaxy containing a complex network of dark, dust features. 
020       The morphology of these features has been examined in some detail using a Hubble Space Telescope, Advanced Camera for Surveys image. It is found that most of the features are constituted of long filaments. There also exist a great number of dark structures protruding inwards from the filaments. Many of these structures are strikingly similar to elephant trunks in H II regions in the Milky Way Galaxy, although much larger. The structures, termed mammoth trunks, generally are filamentary and often have shapes resembling the letters V or Y. In some of the mammoth trunks the stem of the Y can be resolved into two or more filaments, many of which showing signs of being intertwined. A model of the mammoth trunks, related to a recent theory of elephant trunks, is proposed. Based on magnetized filaments, the model is capable of giving an account of the various shapes of the mammoth trunks observed, including the twined structures.

In particular, we find analytically and numerically the quantum and classical capacities for a large family of quantum channels and show that these information transmission rates can be strongly enhanced by introducing dephasing noise in the complex network dynamics.

010       Generalized individual-based epidemic model for vulnerability assessment   of correlated scale-free complex networks
021       Many complex networks exhibit vulnerability to spreading of epidemics, and such vulnerability relates to the viral strain as well as to the network characteristics. 
020       For instance, the structure of the network plays an important role in spreading of epidemics. Additionally, properties of previous epidemic models require prior knowledge of the complex network structure, which means the models are limited to only well-known network structures. In this paper, we propose a new epidemiological SIR model based on the continuous time Markov chain, which is generalized to any type of network. The new model is capable of evaluating the states of every individual in the network. Through mathematical analysis, we prove an epidemic threshold exists below which an epidemic does not propagate in the network. We also show that the new epidemic threshold is inversely proportional to the spectral radius of the network. In particular, we employ the new epidemic model as a novel measure to assess the vulnerability of networks to the spread of epidemics. The new measure considers all possible effective infection rates that an epidemic might possess. Next, we apply the measure to correlated networks to evaluate the vulnerability of disassortative and assortative scalefree networks. Ultimately, we verify the accuracy of the theoretical epidemic threshold through extensive numerical simulations. Within the set of tested networks, the numerical results show that disassortative scale-free networks are more vulnerable to spreading of epidemics than assortative scale-free networks.

We pose the problem as a structure learning problem and solve it using an $\ell_1$-penalized likelihood convex program. We evaluate the solution on a simulated spread of infectious over a complex network. Our topology estimates outperform those of a standard spatial Markov random field graphical model selection using $\ell_1$-regularized logistic regression.

010       From Local Measurements to Network Spectral Properties: Beyond Degree   Distributions
021       It is well-known that the behavior of many dynamical processes running on networks is intimately related to the eigenvalue spectrum of the network. 
020       In this paper, we address the problem of inferring global information regarding the eigenvalue spectrum of a network from a set of local samples of its structure. In particular, we find explicit relationships between the so-called spectral moments of a graph and the presence of certain small subgraphs, also called motifs, in the network. Since the eigenvalues of the network have a direct influence on the network dynamical behavior, our result builds a bridge between local network measurements (i.e., the presence of small subgraphs) and global dynamical behavior (via the spectral moments). Furthermore, based on our result, we propose a novel decentralized scheme to compute the spectral moments of a network by aggregating local measurements of the network topology. Our final objective is to understand the relationships between the behavior of dynamical processes taking place in a large-scale complex network and its local topological properties.

010       Complexity Threshold for Functioning Directed Networks in Damage Size   Distribution
021       A certain complexity threshold is proposed which defines the term `complex network' for RSN, e.g. 
020       Kauffman networks with s&gt;=2 - more than two equally probable state variants. Such Kauffman networks are no longer Boolean networks. RSN are different than RWN and RNS. This article is the second one of three steps in description of `structural tendencies' which are an effect of adaptive evolution of complex RSN. This complexity threshold is based on the appearances of chaotic features of a network during its random growth and disappearance of small network effects. Distribution of damage size (after small disturbance) measured in a fraction of damaged nodes, or in number of damaged external outputs and degree of chaos is investigated using simulation. It is done during growth (up to N=4000 nodes) for different: network types (including scale-free), numbers of node inputs (K=2,3,4, fixed for a network) and numbers of signal variants (s=2,3,4,16). In this distribution two peaks emerge and in-between them there appears an area of zero frequency - this is the best practical criterion of complexity threshold found in the investigation. No critical points are found in the area of emerging complexity. A special simplified algorithm (`reversed-annealed') is used which omits the problem of circular attractors. The investigated `transition' to chaos in respect to N is different from the known phase transition near K=2 for s=2.

In the case of explicit equation for s(k) (e.g. linear or scale-free), the new coefficients of scaling equation can be easily obtained. We support our analysis with numerical simulations for Erdos-Renyi random graphs with different weight distributions.

010       Multi-scale Modularity in Complex Networks
021       We focus on the detection of communities in multi-scale networks, namely networks made of different levels of organization and in which modules exist at different scales. 
020       It is first shown that methods based on modularity are not appropriate to uncover modules in empirical networks, mainly because modularity optimization has an intrinsic bias towards partitions having a characteristic number of modules which might not be compatible with the modular organization of the system. We argue for the use of more flexible quality functions incorporating a resolution parameter that allows us to reveal the natural scales of the system. Different types of multi-resolution quality functions are described and unified by looking at the partitioning problem from a dynamical viewpoint. Finally, significant values of the resolution parameter are selected by using complementary measures of robustness of the uncovered partitions. The methods are illustrated on a benchmark and an empirical network.

010       Characteristics of Real Futures Trading Networks
021       Futures trading is the core of futures business, and is considered as a typical complex system. 
020       To investigate the complexity of futures trading, we employ the analytical method of complex networks. First, we use real trading records from Shanghai Futures Exchange to construct futures trading networks, in which vertices are trading participants, and two vertices have a common edge if the two corresponding investors simultaneously appear in at least one trading record as a purchaser and a seller respectively. Then, we conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis on the constructed futures trading networks, and empirical results show that the futures trading networks exhibit such features as scale-free structure with interesting odd-even-degree divergence in low degree region, small-world effect, hierarchical organization, power-law betweenness distribution, and shrinkage of both average path length and diameter as network size increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses real data to study futures trading networks, and we argue that the research results can shed light on the nature of real futures business.

010       Prediction of extreme events in the OFC model on a small world network
021       We investigate the predictability of extreme events in a dissipative Olami-Feder-Christensen model on a small world topology. 
020       Due to the mechanism of self-organized criticality, it is impossible to predict the magnitude of the next event knowing previous ones, if the system has an infinite size. However, by exploiting the finite size effects, we show that probabilistic predictions of the occurrence of extreme events in the next time step are possible in a finite system. In particular, the finiteness of the system unavoidably leads to repulsive temporal correlations of extreme events. The predictability of those is higher for larger magnitudes and for larger complex network sizes. Finally, we show that our prediction analysis is also robust by remarkably reducing the accessible number of events used to construct the optimal predictor.

010       Missing and spurious interactions and the reconstruction of complex   networks
021       Network analysis is currently used in a myriad of contexts: from identifying potential drug targets to predicting the spread of epidemics and designing vaccination strategies, and from finding friends to uncovering criminal activity. 
020       Despite the promise of the network approach, the reliability of network data is a source of great concern in all fields where complex networks are studied. Here, we present a general mathematical and computational framework to deal with the problem of data reliability in complex networks. In particular, we are able to reliably identify both missing and spurious interactions in noisy network observations. Remarkably, our approach also enables us to obtain, from those noisy observations, network reconstructions that yield estimates of the true network properties that are more accurate than those provided by the observations themselves. Our approach has the potential to guide experiments, to better characterize network data sets, and to drive new discoveries.

010       Adaptive networks: coevolution of disease and topology
021       Adaptive networks have been recently introduced in the context of disease propagation on complex networks. 
020       They account for the mutual interaction between the network topology and the states of the nodes. Until now, existing models have been analyzed using low-complexity analytic formalisms, revealing nevertheless some novel dynamical features. However, current methods have failed to reproduce with accuracy the simultaneous time evolution of the disease and the underlying network topology. In the framework of the adaptive SIS model of Gross et al. [Gross et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 208701 (2006)], we introduce an improved compartmental formalism able to handle this coevolutionary task successfully. With this approach, we analyze the interplay and outcomes of both dynamical elements, process and structure, on adaptive networks featuring different degree distributions at the initial stage.

010       S-curve networks and a new method for estimating degree distributions of   complex networks
021       In the study of complex networks almost all theoretical models are infinite growth, but the size of actual networks is finite. 
020       According to statistics from the China Internet IPv4 addresses, we propose a forecasting model by using S curve (Logistic curve). The growing trend of IPv4 addresses in China is forecasted. There are some reference value for optimizing the distribution of IPv4 address resource and the development of IPv6. Based on the laws of IPv4 growth, that is, the bulk growth and the finitely growing limit, we propose a finite network model with the bulk growth. The model is called S-curve network. Analysis demonstrates that the analytic method based on uniform distributions (i.e., Barab\'asi-Albert method) is not suitable for the network. We develop a new method to predict the growth dynamics of the individual nodes, and use this to calculate analytically the connectivity distribution and the scaling exponents. The analytical result agrees with the simulation well, obeying an approximately power-law form. This method can overcome a shortcoming of Barab\'asi-Albert method commonly used in current network research.

010       Perfect state transfers by selective quantum interferences within   complex spin networks
021       We present a method that implement directional, perfect state transfers within a branched spin network by exploiting quantum interferences in the time-domain. 
020       That provides a tool to isolate subsystems from a large and complex one. Directionality is achieved by interrupting the spin-spin coupled evolution with periods of free Zeeman evolutions, whose timing is tuned to be commensurate with the relative phases accrued by specific spin pairs. This leads to a resonant transfer between the chosen qubits, and to a detuning of all remaining pathways in the network, using only global manipulations. As the transfer is perfect when the selected pathway is mediated by 2 or 3 spins, distant state transfers over complex networks can be achieved by successive recouplings among specific pairs/triads of spins. These effects are illustrated with a quantum simulator involving 13C NMR on Leucine's backbone; a six-spin network.

010       From filamentary clouds to prestellar cores to the stellar IMF: Initial   highlights from the Herschel Gould Belt survey
021       We summarize the first results from the Gould Belt survey, obtained toward the Aquila Rift and Polaris Flare regions during the 'science demonstration phase' of Herschel. 
020       Our 70-500 micron images taken in parallel mode with the SPIRE and PACS cameras reveal a wealth of filamentary structure, as well as numerous dense cores embedded in the filaments. Between ~ 350 and 500 prestellar cores and ~ 45-60 Class 0 protostars can be identified in the Aquila field, while ~ unbound starless cores and no protostars are observed in the Polaris field. The prestellar core mass function (CMF) derived for the Aquila region bears a strong resemblance to the stellar initial mass function (IMF), already confirming the close connection between the CMF and the IMF with much better statistics than earlier studies. Comparing and contrasting our Herschel results in Aquila and Polaris, we propose an observationally-driven scenario for core formation according to which complex networks of long, thin filaments form first within molecular clouds, and then the densest filaments fragment into a number of prestellar cores via gravitational instability.

010       Good practices for a literature survey are not followed by authors while   preparing scientific manuscripts
021       The number of citations received by authors in scientific journals has become a major parameter to assess individual researchers and the journals themselves through the impact factor. 
020       A fair assessment therefore requires that the criteria for selecting references in a given manuscript should be unbiased with respect to the authors or the journals cited. In this paper, we advocate that authors should follow two mandatory principles to select papers (later reflected in the list of references) while studying the literature for a given research: i) consider similarity of content with the topics investigated, lest very related work should be reproduced or ignored; ii) perform a systematic search over the network of citations including seminal or very related papers. We use formalisms of complex networks for two datasets of papers from the arXiv repository to show that neither of these two criteria is fulfilled in practice.

010       Filamentary structures and compact objects in the Aquila and Polaris   clouds observed by Herschel
021       Our PACS and SPIRE images of the Aquila Rift and part of the Polaris Flare regions, taken during the science demonstration phase of Herschel discovered fascinating, omnipresent filamentary structures that appear to be physically related to compact cores. 
020       We briefly describe a new multi-scale, multi-wavelength source extraction method used to detect objects and measure their parameters in our Herschel images. All of the extracted starless cores (541 in Aquila and 302 in Polaris) appear to form in the long and very narrow filaments. With its combination of the far-IR resolution and sensitivity, Herschel directly reveals the filaments in which the dense cores are embedded; the filaments are resolved and have deconvolved widths of 35 arcsec in Aquila and 59 arcsec in Polaris (9000 AU in both regions). Our first results of observations with Herschel enable us to suggest that in general dense cores may originate in a process of fragmentation of complex networks of long, thin filaments, likely formed as a result of an interplay between gravity, interstellar turbulence, and magnetic fields. To unravel the roles of the processes, one has to obtain additional kinematic and polarization information; these follow-up observations are planned.

010       Small World Property of a Rock Joint
021       Evolution of a rough rock fracture using a profile-complex network approach to analysis of shear strength and slip-stick is presented. 
020       Using correlation measure on the evolvable aperture profiles, the proper aperture network is constructed. Characterization of the obtained network reveals the synchronization path of aperture profiles. Transferring to a quasi stable state is followed by a small world property of the network. With introducing new state space, local correlated profiles are related to global connections. The variation of clustering coefficient and edges shows a similar oscillator behavior which includes a few attractors. Joint distribution of local and global filtered correlation gives a close relation to the contact's zones attachment- detachment sequences where around maximum shear strength of the rock joint, the anisotropy in the normalized state space is the highest and in the quasi- stable states local synchronization overcomes.

010       Detecting communities of triangles in complex networks using spectral   optimization
021       The study of the sub-structure of complex networks is of major importance to relate topology and functionality. 
020       Many efforts have been devoted to the analysis of the modular structure of networks using the quality function known as modularity. However, generally speaking, the relation between topological modules and functional groups is still unknown, and depends on the semantic of the links. Sometimes, we know in advance that many connections are transitive and, as a consequence, triangles have a specific meaning. Here we propose the study of the modular structure of networks considering triangles as the building blocks of modules. The method generalizes the standard modularity and uses spectral optimization to find its maximum. We compare the partitions obtained with those resulting from the optimization of the standard modularity in several real networks. The results show that the information reported by the analysis of modules of triangles complements the information of the classical modularity analysis.

010       Quantifying long-range correlations in complex networks beyond nearest   neighbors
021       We propose a fluctuation analysis to quantify spatial correlations in complex networks. 
020       The approach considers the sequences of degrees along shortest paths in the networks and quantifies the fluctuations in analogy to time series. In this work, the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model, the Cayley tree at the percolation transition, a fractal network model, and examples of real-world networks are studied. While the fluctuation functions for the BA model show exponential decay, in the case of the Cayley tree and the fractal network model the fluctuation functions display a power-law behavior. The fractal network model comprises long-range anti-correlations. The results suggest that the fluctuation exponent provides complementary information to the fractal dimension.

010       Hub Synchronization in Scale-Free Networks
021       Heterogeneity in the degree distribution is known to suppress global synchronization in complex networks of symmetrically coupled oscillators. 
020       Scale-free networks present strong heterogeneity, there are a few highly connected nodes, termed hubs, while the majority of nodes has only a few connections. We show that a stable partially synchronized state may take place in scale-free networks: hubs undergo a transition to synchronization while the remaining nodes are unsynchronized. This phenomenon may occur in any large heterogeneous network, regardless of the network global synchronization properties. We provide theory and numerical evidence to establish this phenomenon.

010       On the Efficiency of Data Representation on the Modeling and   Characterization of Complex Networks
021       Specific choices about how to represent complex networks can have a substantial effect on the execution time required for the respective construction and analysis of those structures. 
020       In this work we report a comparison of the effects of representing complex networks statically as matrices or dynamically as spase structures. Three theoretical models of complex networks are considered: two types of Erdos-Renyi as well as the Barabasi-Albert model. We investigated the effect of the different representations with respect to the construction and measurement of several topological properties (i.e. degree, clustering coefficient, shortest path length, and betweenness centrality). We found that different forms of representation generally have a substantial effect on the execution time, with the sparse representation frequently resulting in remarkably superior performance.

010       Network resilience against intelligent attacks constrained by degree   dependent node removal cost
021       We study the resilience of complex networks against attacks in which nodes are targeted intelligently, but where disabling a node has a cost to the attacker which depends on its degree. 
020       Attackers have to meet these costs with limited resources, which constrains their actions. A network's integrity is quantified in terms of the efficacy of the process that it supports. We calculate how the optimal attack strategy and the most attack-resistant network degree statistics depend on the node removal cost function and the attack resources. The resilience of networks against intelligent attacks is found to depend strongly on the node removal cost function faced by the attacker. In particular, if node removal costs increase sufficiently fast with the node degree, power law networks are found to be more resilient than Poissonian ones, even against optimized intelligent attacks.

010       Characterizing the community structure of complex networks
021       Community structure is one of the key properties of complex networks and plays a crucial role in their topology and function. 
020       While an impressive amount of work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little attention has been so far devoted to the investigation of communities in real networks. We present a systematic empirical analysis of the statistical properties of communities in large information, communication, technological, biological, and social networks. We find that the mesoscopic organization of networks of the same category is remarkably similar. This is reflected in several characteristics of community structure, which can be used as ``fingerprints'' of specific network categories. While community size distributions are always broad, certain categories of networks consist mainly of tree-like communities, while others have denser modules. Average path lengths within communities initially grow logarithmically with community size, but the growth saturates or slows down for communities larger than a characteristic size. This behaviour is related to the presence of hubs within communities, whose roles differ across categories. Also the community embeddedness of nodes, measured in terms of the fraction of links within their communities, has a characteristic distribution for each category. Our findings are verified by the use of two fundamentally different community detection methods.

010       Hirsch index as a network centrality measure
021       We study the h Hirsch index as a local node centrality measure for complex networks in general. 
020       The h index is compared with the Degree centrality (a local measure), the Betweenness and Eigenvector centralities (two non-local measures) in the case of a biological network (Yeast interaction protein-protein network) and a linguistic network (Moby Thesaurus II) as test environments. In both networks, the Hirsch index has poor correlation with Betweenness centrality but correlates well with Eigenvector centrality, specially for the more important nodes that are relevant for ranking purposes, say in Search Machine Optimization. In the thesaurus network, the h index seems even to outperform the Eigenvector centrality measure as evaluated by simple linguistic criteria.

020       To date there is no generally accepted decipherment of these sign sequences and there have been suggestions that the signs could be non-linguistic. Here we apply complex network analysis techniques to a database of available Indus inscriptions, with the aim of detecting patterns indicative of syntactic organization. Our results show the presence of patterns, e.g., recursive structures in the segmentation trees of the sequences, that suggest the existence of a grammar underlying these inscriptions.

010       Universal role of migration in the evolution of cooperation
021       We study the role of unbiased migration in cooperation in the framework of spatial evolutionary game on a variety of spatial structures, involving regular lattice, continuous plane and complex networks. 
020       A striking finding is that migration plays a universal role in cooperation, regardless of the spatial structures. For high degree of migration, cooperators cannot survive due to the failure of forming cooperator clusters to resist attacks of defectors. While for low degree of migration, cooperation is considerably enhanced compared to statically spatial game, which is due to the strengthening of the boundary of cooperator clusters by the occasionally accumulation of cooperators along the boundary. The cooperator cluster thus becomes more robust than that in static game and defectors nearby the boundary can be assimilated by cooperators, so the cooperator cluster expands, which facilitates cooperation. The general role of migration will be substantiated by sufficient simulations associated with heuristic explanations.

010       Communities and beyond: mesoscopic analysis of a large social network   with complementary methods
021       Large complex networks show different levels of organization. 
020       At the mesoscopic scale communities are considered the most important structures that relate to system function but also other formations like trees or stars may appear. Communities are characterized as groups of nodes with dense internal and loose inter-group connectivity, but beyond this simple notion, even the definition of a community is a controversial issue. Numerous community detection methods have been proposed and assessed either on small empirical networks or larger synthetic benchmarks. However, little is known about their performance on large real-world networks and about the meaningfulness of the community structure they produce. Here we apply three community detection methods, Infomap, the Louvain method, and clique percolation to a large real-world social network based on mobile telephone calls and compare their results. Benchmarks are fabricated to capture only selected aspects of reality, while large empirical networks are much more complex. The Infomap and Louvain methods perform well on benchmarks but are found problematic in real-world networks as they lead to partitions, which on sparse graphs with large tree-like parts give rise to misleading conclusions. Clique percolation is found to outperform them by identifying at least the cores of communities, while some important connections nevertheless remain unidentified. The partitioning methods turn out to be useful in uncovering other mesoscale structures different from communities, such as large tree-like regions. The simultaneous application of different methods, the comparison of their similarities and differences with respect to topology, the density of links and the role of edge weights provide a more complete picture about the mesoscopic structure of large complex networks.

010       Optimization of transport protocols with path-length constraints in   complex networks
021       We propose a protocol optimization technique that is applicable to both weighted or unweighted graphs. 
020       Our aim is to explore by how much a small variation around the Shortest Path or Optimal Path protocols can enhance protocol performance. Such an optimization strategy can be necessary because even though some protocols can achieve very high traffic tolerance levels, this is commonly done by enlarging the path-lengths, which may jeopardize scalability. We use ideas borrowed from Extremal Optimization to guide our algorithm, which proves to be an effective technique. Our method exploits the degeneracy of the paths or their close-weight alternatives, which significantly improves the scalability of the protocols in comparison to Shortest Paths or Optimal Paths protocols, keeping at the same time almost intact the length or weight of the paths. This characteristic ensures that the optimized routing protocols are composed of paths that are quick to traverse, avoiding negative effects in data communication due to path-length increases that can become specially relevant when information losses are present.

010       SONoMA: A Service Oriented Network Measurement Architecture
021       To characterize the structure, dynamics and operational state of the Internet it requires distributed measurements. 
020       Although in the last decades several systems capable to do this have been created, the easy access of these infrastructures and orchestration of complex measurements is not solved. We propose a system architecture that combines the flexibility of mature network measurement infrastructures such as PlanetLab or ETOMIC with the general accessibility and popularity of public services like Web based bandwidth measurement or traceroute servers. To realize these requirements we developed a multi-layer architecture based on Web Services and the basic principles of SOA, which is a very popular paradigm in distributed business application development. Our approach opens the door to perform complex network measurements, handles heterogeneous measurement devices, automatically stores the results in a public database and protects against malicious users as well. To demonstrate our concept we developed a public prototype system, called SONoMA.

010       Ordering in voter models on networks: Exact reduction to a   single-coordinate diffusion
021       We study the voter model and related random-copying processes on arbitrarily complex network structures. 
020       Through a representation of the dynamics as a particle reaction process, we show that a quantity measuring the degree of order in a finite system is, under certain conditions, exactly governed by a universal diffusion equation. Whenever this reduction occurs, the details of the network structure and random-copying process affect only a single parameter in the diffusion equation. The validity of the reduction can be established with considerably less information than one might expect: it suffices to know just two characteristic timescales within the dynamics of a single pair of reacting particles. We develop methods to identify these timescales, and apply them to deterministic and random network structures. We focus in particular on how the ordering time is affected by degree correlations, since such effects are hard to access by existing theoretical approaches.

010       Unraveling the modular evolution of the yeast protein interaction   network
021       The evolution of protein-protein interactions over time has led to a complex network whose character is modular in the cellular function and highly correlated in its connectivity. 
020       The question of the characterization and emergence of modularity following principles of evolution remains an important challenge as there is no encompassing theory to explain the resulting modular topology. Here, we perform an empirical study of the yeast protein-interaction network. We find a novel large-scale modular organization of the functional classes of proteins characterized in terms of scale-invariant laws of modularity. We develop a mathematical framework and demonstrate a relationship between the modular structure and the evolution growth rate of the interactions, conserved proteins, and topological length-scales in the system revealing a hierarchy of mutational events giving rise to the modular topology. These results are expected to apply to other complex networks providing a general theoretical framework to describe their modular organization and dynamics.

010       A note on measurement of network vulnerability under random and   intentional attacks
021       In this paper we propose an alternative approach for the assessment of network vulnerability under random and intentional attacks as compared to the results obtained from the "vulnerability function" given by Criado et al. 
020       [Criado et al. (Int. J. Comput. Math., 86 (2) (2009), pp. 209-218)]. By using spectral and statistical measurements, we assess robustness as the antonym to vulnerability of complex networks and suggest a tentative ranking for vulnerability, based on the interpretation of quantified network characteristics. We conclude that vulnerability function, derived from the network's degree distribution and its variations only, is not general enough to reflect the lack of robustness due to the specific configurations in graphs with hierarchical or centralized structures. The spectral and statistical metrics, on the other hand, capture different aspects of network topology which provide a more thorough assessment of network vulnerability.

020       This paper considers a class of networks based around a new concept (the locale) that allow exact results to be derived for epidemic dynamics. While there is no restriction on the motifs that can be found in such graphs, each node must be uniquely assigned to a generally clustered subgraph in this construction.

010       Diversity and critical behavior in prisoner's dilemma game
021       The prisoner's dilemma (PD) game is a simple model for understanding cooperative patterns in complex systems consisting of selfish individuals. 
020       Here, we study a PD game problem in scale-free networks containing hierarchically organized modules and controllable shortcuts connecting separated hubs. We find that cooperator clusters exhibit a percolation transition in the parameter space (p,b), where p is the occupation probability of shortcuts and b is the temptation payoff in the PD game. The cluster size distribution follows a power law at the transition point. Such a critical behavior, resulting from the combined effect of stochastic processes in the PD game and the heterogeneous structure of complex networks, illustrates the diversity of social relationships and the self-organization of cooperator communities in real-world systems.

010       Complex Networks and Symmetry: a Review with Applications to the   Evolution of World Trade
021       In this review we establish various connections between complex networks, symmetry, and symmetry breaking. 
020       We first rephrase the main results of network theory in terms of symmetry concepts, then we study link reversal symmetry as a particular example, and finally consider the evolution of the international trade network as a real-world application. We show that a strong embedding in economic space breaks the invariance of the trade network down to disjoint equivalence classes, while the observed evolution of reciprocity is consistent with a symmetry breaking taking place in production space. Our results show that networks can be strongly affected by symmetry-breaking phenomena occurring in embedding spaces, and that network symmetries can therefore suggest, or rule out, possible underlying mechanisms.

010       Spectral dimensions of hierarchical scale-free networks with shortcuts
021       The spectral dimension has been widely used to understand transport properties on regular and fractal lattices. 
020       Nevertheless, it has been little studied for complex networks such as scale-free and small world networks. Here we study the spectral dimension and the return-to-origin probability of random walks on hierarchical scale-free networks, which can be either fractals or non-fractals depending on the weight of shortcuts. Applying the renormalization group (RG) approach to the Gaussian model, we obtain the spectral dimension exactly. While the spectral dimension varies between $1$ and $2$ for the fractal case, it remains at $2$, independent of the variation of network structure for the non-fractal case. The crossover behavior between the two cases is studied through the RG flow analysis. The analytic results are confirmed by simulation results and their implications for the architecture of complex systems are discussed.

010       Impact of network structure on competitive evolutionary processes
021       We consider an evolutionary model in which the individuals of different species move over a complex network and are subject to reproduction and selection. 
020       The complementary roles of selection and diffusion produce a variety of fixed points, whose stability depends mostly on the structure of the underlying complex network. The proposed model can be useful to simulate different diffusion processes which usually take place on complex topologies and are characterized by strong competition among orthogonal species, such as diffusion of consumer products, competition of biotypes, and selections of languages.

010       Non-Abelian statistics and topological quantum computation in 1D wire   networks
021       Topological quantum computation provides an elegant way around decoherence, as one encodes quantum information in a non-local fashion that the environment finds difficult to corrupt. 
020       Here we introduce a surprising new topological quantum computation platform: one-dimensional semiconductor wire networks. Previous work [Lutchyn et al., <a href="/abs/1002.4033">arXiv:1002.4033</a> and Oreg et al., <a href="/abs/1003.1145">arXiv:1003.1145</a>] provided a recipe for driving semiconducting wires into a topological phase supporting long-sought particles known as Majorana fermions that can store topologically protected quantum information. Majorana fermions in this setting can be transported, created, and fused by applying locally tunable gates to the wire. More importantly, we show that networks of such wires allow Majorana fermions to be meaningfully braided and that they exhibit non-Abelian statistics like vortices in a p+ip superconductor. We propose simple experimental setups that allow for the Majorana fusion rules to be probed, along with more complex networks that allow for efficient exchange of arbitrary numbers of Majorana fermions. This work paves a new path forward in the field of topological quantum computation that benefits from physical transparency and experimental realism.

010       Hyperbolic Geometry of Complex Networks
021       We develop a geometric framework to study the structure and function of complex networks. 
020       We assume that hyperbolic geometry underlies these networks, and show that with this assumption, heterogeneous degree distributions and strong clustering in complex networks emerge naturally as simple reflections of the negative curvature and metric property of the underlying hyperbolic geometry. Conversely, we show that if a network has some metric structure, and if the network degree distribution is heterogeneous, then the network has an effective hyperbolic geometry underneath. We then establish a mapping between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex networks. This mapping interprets edges in a network as non-interacting fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes, while the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these energies/distances. The geometric network ensemble subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures. Finally, we show that targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge, made possible by our geometric framework, are maximally efficient, according to all efficiency measures, in networks with strongest heterogeneity and clustering, and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure.

In this paper, we argue that in some case the RDG method will lead to the failure of synchronization ($R=\lambda^{r}_{2}/\lambda^{r}_{N}=0$). Additionally, we also propose a so-called residual betweenness gradient (RBG) method to solve this problem.

021       A useful property of a network that can be used to characterize many systems is the degree distribution. 
020       However, many complex networks exhibit higher--order degree correlations that must be studied through other means, such as clustering coefficients, the Newman r factor, and the average nearest neighbour degree (ANND). In this paper we develop an expansion of the conditional probability that can be used to parameterize such degree correlations. The measures of degree correlations associated with this expansion can be used to signal the presence of non--linear correlations.

The order/disorder phase transition is observed in this system. The calculated values of the critical noise parameter are q_c=0.089(5), q_c=0.078(3), and q_c=0.114(2) for honeycomb, Kagome and triangular lattices, respectively. The critical exponents beta/nu, gamma/nu and 1/nu for this model are 0.15(5), 1.64(5), and 0.87(5); 0.14(3), 1.64(3), and 0.86(6); 0.12(4), 1.59(5), and 1.08(6) for honeycomb, Kagome and triangular lattices, respectively. These results differs from the usual Ising model results and the majority-vote model on so-far studied regular lattices or complex networks. The effective dimensionalities of the system D_{eff}= 1.96(5) (honeycomb), D_{eff} =1.92(4) (Kagome), and D_{eff}= 1.83(5) (triangular) for these networks are just compatible to the embedding dimension two.

010       Inflection system of a language as a complex network
021       We investigate inflection structure of a synthetic language using Latin as an example. 
020       We construct a bipartite graph in which one group of vertices correspond to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected forms encountered in a given text. Each inflected form is connected to its corresponding headword, which in some cases in non-unique. The resulting sparse graph decomposes into a large number of connected components, to be called word groups. We then show how the concept of the word group can be used to construct coverage curves of selected Latin texts. We also investigate a version of the inflection graph in which all theoretically possible inflected forms are included. Distribution of sizes of connected components of this graphs resembles cluster distribution in a lattice percolation near the critical point.

The purpose of our work is to show the example of intelligent data analysis in such complex and non-formalized field as science. Using the statistical data about scientific periodical it is possible to perform its comprehensive analysis and to solve different practical problems. The combination of various approaches including the statistical analysis, methods of the complex network theory and different techniques that can be used for the concept mapping permits to perform an intelligent data analysis in order to obtain underlying patterns and hidden connections. Results of such analysis can be used for particular practical problems like information retrieval within journal.

010       Sustainable growth in complex networks
021       Based on the empirical analysis of the dependency network in 18 Java projects, we develop a novel model of network growth which considers both: an attachment mechanism and the addition of new nodes with a heterogeneous distribution of their initial degree, $k_0$. 
020       Empirically we find that the cumulative degree distributions of initial degrees and of the final network, follow power-law behaviors: $P(k_{0}) \propto k_{0}^{1-\alpha}$, and $P(k)\propto k^{1-\gamma}$, respectively. For the total number of links as a function of the network size, we find empirically $K(N)\propto N^{\beta}$, where $\beta$ is (at the beginning of the network evolution) between 1.25 and 2, while converging to $\sim 1$ for large $N$. This indicates a transition from a growth regime with increasing network density towards a sustainable regime, which revents a collapse because of ever increasing dependencies. Our theoretical framework is able to predict relations between the exponents $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, which also link issues of software engineering and developer activity. These relations are verified by means of computer simulations and empirical investigations. They indicate that the growth of real Open Source Software networks occurs on the edge between two regimes, which are either dominated by the initial degree distribution of added nodes, or by the preferential attachment mechanism. Hence, the heterogeneous degree distribution of newly added nodes, found empirically, is essential to describe the laws of sustainable growth in networks.

010       Mean First Hitting Time of Searching for Path Through Random Walks on   Complex Networks
021       We study the problem of searching for a fixed path $\epsilon_0\epsilon_1\cdots\epsilon_l$ on a network through random walks. 
020       We analyze the first hitting time of tracking the path, and obtain exact expression of mean first hitting time $\langle T \rangle$. Surprisingly we find that $\langle T \rangle$ is divided into two distinct parts: $T_1$ and $T_2$. The first part $T_1 =2m\prod_{i=1}^{l-1}d(\epsilon_i)$, is related with the path itself and is proportional to the degree product. The second part $T_2$ is related with the network structure. Based on the analytic results, we propose a natural measure for each path, i.e. $\varphi=\prod_{i=1}^{l-1}d(\epsilon_i)$, and call it random walk path measure(RWPM). $\varphi$ essentially determines a path's performance in searching and transporting processes. By minimizing $\varphi$, we also find RW optimal routing which is a combination of random walk and shortest path routing. RW optimal routing can effectively balance traffic load on nodes and edges across the whole network, and is superior to shortest path routing on any type of complex networks. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis.

021       We propose a degree-based coarse graining approach that not just accelerates the evaluation of dynamics on complex networks, but also satisfies the consistency conditions for both equilibrium statistical distributions and nonequilibrium dynamical flows. 
020       For the Ising model and susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model, we introduce these required conditions explicitly and further prove that they are satisfied by our coarse-grained network construction within the annealed network approximation. Finally, we numerically show that the phase transitions and fluctuations on the coarse-grained network are all in good agreements with those on the original one.

010       Beyond the Death of Linear Response: 1/f optimal information transport
021       Non-ergodic renewal processes have recently been shown by several authors to be insensitive to periodic perturbations, thereby apparently sanctioning the death of linear response, a building block of nonequilibrium statistical physics. 
020       We show that it is possible to go beyond the ``death of linear response" and establish a permanent correlation between an external stimulus and the response of a complex network generating non-ergodic renewal processes, by taking as stimulus a similar non-ergodic process. The ideal condition of 1/f-noise corresponds to a singularity that is expected to be relevant in several experimental conditions.

010       Selecting an exponential random graph model for complex brain networks
021       Exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p* models, have been utilized extensively in the social science literature to study complex networks. 
020       However, the literature on their use in biological networks (especially brain networks) has remained sparse. Descriptive analyses based on small-world network metrics have dominated connectivity research in neuroscience. The few inferential studies have relied on overly simplified univariate summary statistics which vastly underutilize the amount of information in the data. While these more basic testing approaches provide guidance and serve as a foundation for future analyses, methods that incorporate the complexity inherent in the data are needed. ERGMs allow statistically accounting for the complexity inherent in whole-brain network data, thus providing a framework for whole-brain research. We illustrate the utility of ERGMs for modeling, analyzing, and simulating complex whole-brain networks with network data from normal subjects. We also provide a foundation for model selection through the implementation and assessment of three model selection approaches: a traditional p-value based backward selection approach, an information criterion approach (AIC), and a graphical goodness of fit (GOF) approach. The graphical GOF approach serves as the best method given the scientific interest in being able to capture and reproduce the structure of fitted brain networks.

010       Distinguishing Fact from Fiction: Pattern Recognition in Texts Using   Complex Networks
021       We establish concrete mathematical criteria to distinguish between different kinds of written storytelling, fictional and non-fictional. 
020       Specifically, we constructed a semantic network from both novels and news stories, with $N$ independent words as vertices or nodes, and edges or links allotted to words occurring within $m$ places of a given vertex; we call $m$ the word distance. We then used measures from complex network theory to distinguish between news and fiction, studying the minimal text length needed as well as the optimized word distance $m$. The literature samples were found to be most effectively represented by their corresponding power laws over degree distribution $P(k)$ and clustering coefficient $C(k)$; we also studied the mean geodesic distance, and found all our texts were small-world networks. We observed a natural break-point at $k=\sqrt{N}$ where the power law in the degree distribution changed, leading to separate power law fit for the bulk and the tail of $P(k)$. Our linear discriminant analysis yielded a $73.8 \pm 5.15%$ accuracy for the correct classification of novels and $69.1 \pm 1.22%$ for news stories. We found an optimal word distance of $m=4$ and a minimum text length of 100 to 200 independent words $N$.

010       Optimal random walks in complex networks with limited information
021       Designing diffusion processes which maximize the entropy rate on a given graph is an issue of utmost importance, with relevant applications in social, biological and technological systems. 
020       We demonstrate that it is possible to construct maximal-entropy random walks with only local information on the graph structure. In particular, we show that an almost optimal random walk is obtained when the step probabilities are proportional to a power of the degree of the target node, with an exponent $\alpha$ that depends on the degree-degree correlations, and is equal to 1 in uncorrelated graphs.

010       Scalable distributed service migration via Complex Networks Analysis
021       With social networking sites providing increasingly richer context, User-Centric Service (UCS) creation is expected to explode following a similar success path to User-Generated Content. 
020       One of the major challenges in this emerging highly user-centric networking paradigm is how to make these exploding in numbers yet, individually, of vanishing demand services available in a cost-effective manner. Of prime importance to the latter (and focus of this paper) is the determination of the optimal location for hosting a UCS. Taking into account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as a facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable heuristic solution to it. <br />Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on Complex Network Analysis. Given a current location of UCS, this metric helps to a) identify a small subgraph of nodes with high capacity to act as service demand concentrators; b) project on them a reduced yet accurate view of the global demand distribution that preserves the key attraction forces on UCS; and, ultimately, c) pave the service migration path towards its optimal location in the network. The proposed iterative UCS migration algorithm, called cDSMA, is extensively evaluated over synthetic and real-world network topologies. Our results show that cDSMA achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, remarkable insensitivity to the size and diameter of the network and resilience to inaccurate estimates of demands for UCS across the network. It is also shown to clearly outperform local-search heuristics for service migration that constrain the subgraph to the immediate neighbourhood of the node currently hosting UCS.

010       Predicting criticality and dynamic range in complex networks: effects of   topology
021       The collective dynamics of a network of coupled excitable systems in response to an external stimulus depends on the topology of the connections in the network. 
020       Here we develop a general theoretical approach to study the effects of network topology on dynamic range, which quantifies the range of stimulus intensities resulting in distinguishable network responses. We find that the largest eigenvalue of the weighted network adjacency matrix governs the network dynamic range. Specifically, a largest eigenvalue equal to one corresponds to a critical regime with maximum dynamic range. We gain deeper insight on the effects of network topology using a nonlinear analysis in terms of additional spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. We find that homogeneous networks can reach a higher dynamic range than those with heterogeneous topology. Our analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, generalizes results of previous studies in terms of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.

010       A Systemic Receptor Network Triggered by Human cytomegalovirus Entry
021       Virus entry is a multistep process that triggers a variety of cellular pathways interconnecting into a complex network, yet the molecular complexity of this network remains largely unsolved. 
020       Here, by employing systems biology approach, we reveal a systemic virus-entry network initiated by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread opportunistic pathogen. This network contains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of proteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and functional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly, within 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion transport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire process of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are specifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune response during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network involving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface receptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal development, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule metabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in chromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting that global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in HCMV entry. Results of in silico knock out further reveal that this entire receptor network is primarily controlled by multiple elements, such as EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor) and SLC10A1 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family, member 1). Thus, our results demonstrate that a complex systemic network, in which components coordinating efficiently in time and space contributes to virus entry.

010       A complex network approach to robustness and vulnerability of spatially   organized water distribution networks
021       In this work, water distribution systems are regarded as large sparse planar graphs with complex network characteristics and the relationship between important topological features of the network (i.e. 
020       structural robustness and loop redundancy) and system resilience, viewed as the antonym to structural vulnerability, are assessed. Deterministic techniques from complex networks and spectral graph theory are utilized to quantify well-connectedness and estimate loop redundancy in the studied benchmark networks. By using graph connectivity and expansion properties, system robustness against node/link failures and isolation of the demand nodes from the source(s) are assessed and network tolerance against random failures and targeted attacks on their bridges and cut sets are analyzed. Among other measurements, two metrics of meshed-ness and algebraic connectivity are proposed as candidates for quantification of redundancy and robustness, respectively, in optimization design models. A brief discussion on the scope and limitations of the provided measurements in the analysis of operational reliability of water distribution systems is presented.

020       Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.

Guided with the constructed map, which we release with this paper, Internet routing exhibits scaling properties close to theoretically best possible, thus resolving serious scaling limitations that the Internet faces today. Besides this immediate practical viability, our network mapping method can provide a different perspective on the community structure in complex networks.

010       Griffiths phases on complex networks
021       Quenched disorder is known to play a relevant role in dynamical processes and phase transitions. 
020       Its effects on the dynamics of complex networks have hardly been studied. Aimed at filling this gap, we analyze the Contact Process, i.e. the simplest propagation model, with quenched disorder on complex networks. We find Griffiths phases and other rare region effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic, logarithmic, ...) relaxation, on Erd\H os-R\'enyi networks. Similar effects are predicted to exist for other topologies with a finite percolation threshold. More surprisingly, we find that Griffiths phases can also emerge in the absence of quenched disorder, as a consequence of topological heterogeneity in networks with finite topological dimension. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation phenomena and other dynamical processes on networks.

We analyze the mechanism, describe the oscillating states, identify the pacemaker loops and explain key features of their distribution. This mechanism may play a role in epileptic seizures.

010       A Hebbian approach to complex network generation
021       Through a redefinition of patterns in an Hopfield-like model, we introduce and develop an approach to model discrete systems made up of many, interacting components with inner degrees of freedom. 
020       Our approach clarifies the intrinsic connection between the kind of interactions among components and the emergent topology describing the system itself; also, it allows to effectively address the statistical mechanics on the resulting networks. Indeed, a wide class of analytically treatable, weighted random graphs with a tunable level of correlation can be recovered and controlled. We especially focus on the case of imitative couplings among components endowed with similar patterns (i.e. attributes), which, as we show, naturally and without any a-priori assumption, gives rise to small-world effects. We also solve the thermodynamics (at a replica symmetric level) by extending the double stochastic stability technique: free energy, self consistency relations and fluctuation analysis for a picture of criticality are obtained.

010       Statistical Behavior of Embeddedness and Communities of Overlapping   Cliques in Online Social Networks
021       Degree distribution of nodes, especially a power law degree distribution, has been regarded as one of the most significant structural characteristics of social and information networks. 
020       Node degree, however, only discloses the first-order structure of a network. Higher-order structures such as the edge embeddedness and the size of communities may play more important roles in many online social networks. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the existence of rich higherorder structural characteristics in online social networks, develop mathematical models to interpret and model these characteristics, and discuss their various applications in practice. In particular, 1) We show that the embeddedness distribution of social links in many social networks has interesting and rich behavior that cannot be captured by well-known network models. We also provide empirical results showing a clear correlation between the embeddedness distribution and the average number of messages communicated between pairs of social network nodes. 2) We formally prove that random k-tree, a recent model for complex networks, has a power law embeddedness distribution, and show empirically that the random k-tree model can be used to capture the rich behavior of higherorder structures we observed in real-world social networks. 3) Going beyond the embeddedness, we show that a variant of the random k-tree model can be used to capture the power law distribution of the size of communities of overlapping cliques discovered recently.

010       Multiplex Structures: Patterns of Complexity in Real-World Networks
021       Complex network theory aims to model and analyze complex systems that consist of multiple and interdependent components. 
020       Among all studies on complex networks, topological structure analysis is of the most fundamental importance, as it represents a natural route to understand the dynamics, as well as to synthesize or optimize the functions, of networks. A broad spectrum of network structural patterns have been respectively reported in the past decade, such as communities, multipartites, hubs, authorities, outliers, bow ties, and others. Here, we show that most individual real-world networks demonstrate multiplex structures. That is, a multitude of known or even unknown (hidden) patterns can simultaneously situate in the same network, and moreover they may be overlapped and nested with each other to collaboratively form a heterogeneous, nested or hierarchical organization, in which different connective phenomena can be observed at different granular levels. In addition, we show that the multiplex structures hidden in exploratory networks can be well defined as well as effectively recognized within an unified framework consisting of a set of proposed concepts, models, and algorithms. Our findings provide a strong evidence that most real-world complex systems are driven by a combination of heterogeneous mechanisms that may collaboratively shape their ubiquitous multiplex structures as we observe currently. This work also contributes a mathematical tool for analyzing different sources of networks from a new perspective of unveiling multiplex structures, which will be beneficial to multiple disciplines including sociology, economics and computer science.

010       Pattern formation in oscillatory complex networks consisting of   excitable nodes
021       Recently, oscillatory dynamics of complex networks has attracted great attention due to its new physics of pattern formation as well as its wide applications, particularly, in neural networks. 
020       In this article we study pattern formation in oscillatory complex networks consisting of excitable nodes. We find there exist few center nodes and small skeletons for most oscillations. Complicated and seemly random oscillatory patterns can be viewed as well-organized target waves propagating from the center nodes through the shortest paths, and the shortest loop passing both the center nodes and their drivers plays the role of oscillation source. Reading the simple skeletons we can understand and predict various essential properties of oscillations of the original networks and effectively control (suppress, create and modulate) the network oscillations. These ideas and methods will open a new insight into the pattern formation in complex networks, and provide useful tools for studying oscillations of neural networks.

010       Biochemical Filter with Sigmoidal Response: Increasing the Complexity of   Biomolecular Logic
021       The first realization of a designed, rather than natural, biochemical filter process is reported and analyzed as a promising network component for increasing the complexity of biomolecular logic systems. 
020       Key challenge in biochemical logic research has been achieving scalability for complex network designs. Various logic gates have been realized, but a "toolbox" of analog elements for interconnectivity and signal processing has remained elusive. Filters are important as network elements that allow control of noise in signal transmission and conversion. We report a versatile biochemical filtering mechanism designed to have sigmoidal response in combination with signal-conversion process. Horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chromogenic electron donor by hydrogen peroxide, was altered by adding ascorbate, allowing to selectively suppress the output signal, modifying the response from convex to sigmoidal. A kinetic model was developed for evaluation of the quality of filtering. The results offer improved capabilities for design of scalable biomolecular information processing systems.

010       Information filtering in complex weighted networks
021       Many systems in nature, society and technology can be described as networks, where the vertices are the system's elements and edges between vertices indicate the interactions between the corresponding elements. 
020       Edges may be weighted if the interaction strength is measurable. However, the full network information is often redundant because tools and techniques from network analysis do not work or become very inefficient if the network is too dense and some weights may just reflect measurement errors, and shall be discarded. Moreover, since weight distributions in many complex weighted networks are broad, most of the weight is concentrated among a small fraction of all edges. It is then crucial to properly detect relevant edges. Simple thresholding would leave only the largest weights, disrupting the multiscale structure of the system, which is at the basis of the structure of complex networks, and ought to be kept. In this paper we propose a weight filtering technique based on a global null model (GloSS filter), keeping both the weight distribution and the full topological structure of the network. The method correctly quantifies the statistical significance of weights assigned independently to the edges from a given distribution. Applications to real networks reveal that the GloSS filter is indeed able to identify relevant connections between vertices.

010       Robustness of Random Graphs Based on Natural Connectivity
021       Recently, it has been proposed that the natural connectivity can be used to efficiently characterise the robustness of complex networks. 
020       Natural connectivity quantifies the redundancy of alternative routes in a network by evaluating the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths and can be regarded as the average eigenvalue obtained from the graph spectrum. In this article, we explore the natural connectivity of random graphs both analytically and numerically and show that it increases linearly with the average degree. By comparing with regular ring lattices and random regular graphs, we show that random graphs are more robust than random regular graphs; however, the relationship between random graphs and regular ring lattices depends on the average degree and graph size. We derive the critical graph size as a function of the average degree, which can be predicted by our analytical results. When the graph size is less than the critical value, random graphs are more robust than regular ring lattices, whereas regular ring lattices are more robust than random graphs when the graph size is greater than the critical value.

010       Expansion and Search in Networks
021       Borrowing from concepts in expander graphs, we study the expansion properties of real-world, complex networks (e.g. 
020       social networks, unstructured peer-to-peer or P2P networks) and the extent to which these properties can be exploited to understand and address the problem of decentralized search. We first produce samples that concisely capture the overall expansion properties of an entire network, which we collectively refer to as the expansion signature. Using these signatures, we find a correspondence between the magnitude of maximum expansion and the extent to which a network can be efficiently searched. We further find evidence that standard graph-theoretic measures, such as average path length, fail to fully explain the level of "searchability" or ease of information diffusion and dissemination in a network. Finally, we demonstrate that this high expansion can be leveraged to facilitate decentralized search in networks and show that an expansion-based search strategy outperforms typical search methods.

010       Complex Networks and Symmetry II: Reciprocity and Evolution of World   Trade
021       We exploit the symmetry concepts developed in the companion review of this article to introduce a stochastic version of link reversal symmetry, which leads to an improved understanding of the reciprocity of directed networks. 
020       We apply our formalism to the international trade network and show that a strong embedding in economic space determines particular symmetries of the network, while the observed evolution of reciprocity is consistent with a symmetry breaking taking place in production space. Our results show that networks can be strongly affected by symmetry-breaking phenomena occurring in embedding spaces, and that stochastic network symmetries can successfully suggest, or rule out, possible underlying mechanisms.

021       We propose a method for deriving networks from one-dimensional binary cellular automata. 
020       The derived networks are usually directed and have structural properties corresponding to the dynamical behaviors of their cellular automata. Network parameters, particularly the efficiency and the degree distribution, show that the dependence of efficiency on the grid size is characteristic and can be used to classify cellular automata and that derived networks exhibit various degree distributions. In particular, a class IV rule of Wolfram's classification produces a network having a scale-free distribution.

010       Spatio-temporal structure of cell distribution in cortical Bone   Multicellular Units: a mathematical model
021       Bone remodelling maintains the functionality of skeletal tissue by locally coordinating bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) in the form of Bone Multicellular Units (BMUs). 
020       Understanding the emergence of such structured units out of the complex network of biochemical interactions between bone cells is essential to extend our fundamental knowledge of normal bone physiology and its disorders. To this end, we propose a spatio-temporal continuum model that integrates some of the most important interaction pathways currently known to exist between cells of the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineage. This mathematical model allows us to test the significance and completeness of these pathways based on their ability to reproduce the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual BMUs. We show that under suitable conditions, the experimentally-observed structured cell distribution of cortical BMUs is retrieved. The proposed model admits travelling-wave-like solutions for the cell densities with tightly organised profiles, corresponding to the progression of a single remodelling BMU. The shapes of these spatial profiles within the travelling structure can be linked to the intrinsic parameters of the model such as differentiation and apoptosis rates for bone cells. In addition to the cell distribution, the spatial distribution of regulatory factors can also be calculated. This provides new insights on how different regulatory factors exert their action on bone cells leading to cellular spatial and temporal segregation, and functional coordination.

010       Jamming in complex networks with degree correlation
021       We study the effects of the degree-degree correlations on the pressure congestion J when we apply a dynamical process on scale free complex networks using the gradient network approach. 
020       We find that the pressure congestion for disassortative (assortative) networks is lower (bigger) than the one for uncorrelated networks which allow us to affirm that disassortative networks enhance transport through them. This result agree with the fact that many real world transportation networks naturally evolve to this kind of correlation. We explain our results showing that for the disassortative case the clusters in the gradient network turn out to be as much elongated as possible, reducing the pressure congestion J and observing the opposite behavior for the assortative case. Finally we apply our model to real world networks, and the results agree with our theoretical model.

We derive an exact iterative inversion algorithm and develop efficient approximations based on dynamical mean-field and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations that express the interactions in terms of equal-time and one time step-delayed correlation functions.

010       Profile and scaling of the fractal exponent of percolations in complex   networks
021       We propose a novel finite size scaling analysis for percolation transition observed in complex networks. 
020       While it is known that the cooperative systems in growing network models often undergo an infinite order transition with inverted Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless singularity, the transition point is very hard for numerical simulations to find because the system is in a critical state outside the ordered phase. We propose a finite size scaling form for the order parameter by using the fractal exponent, which enables us to determine the transition points and critical exponents numerically for infinite order transitions as well as standard second order transitions. We confirm the validity of our scaling hypothesis through the Monte-Carlo simulations for bond percolations in two network models; the growing random network model, which exhibits an infinite order transition, and its reconstructed network, which shows a conventional second order transition.

010       Local Empathy provides Global Minimization of Congestion in   Communication Networks
021       We present a novel mechanism to avoid congestion in complex networks based on local knowledge of traffic conditions and the ability of routers to self-coordinate their dynamical behavior. 
020       In particular, routers make use of local information about traffic conditions to either reject or accept information packets from their neighbors. We show that when nodes are only aware of their own congestion state they self-organize into a hierarchical configuration that delays remarkably the onset of congestion although, leading to a sharp first-order like congestion transition. We also consider the case when nodes are aware of the congestion state of their neighbors. In this case, we show that empathy between nodes is strongly beneficial to the overall performance of the system and it is possible to achieve larger values for the critical load together with a smooth, second-order like, transition. Finally, we show how local empathy minimize the impact of congestion as much as global minimization. Therefore, here we present an outstanding example of how local dynamical rules can optimize the system's functioning up to the levels reached using global knowledge.

010       Node similarity is the basic principle behind connectivity in complex   networks
021       Who is connecting to whom in social communities? A popular belief is that preferential attachment to a highly connected network-node is an adequate model for real networks. 
020       By contrast, this work reveals that node similarity is the fundamental mechanism that gives complex networks its typical scale-free power-law characteristics. Additionally, it turns out that power-law node-degree distributions are restricted to only sparsely connected communities. More densely connected communities show an increasing divergence from power-law. A similarity model as proposed in this work, covers the full observed diversity of real networks and hence explains the topological transition from weakly to strongly connected societies.

010       Rich-club connectivity dominates assortativity and transitivity of   complex networks
021       Rich-club, assortativity and clustering coefficients are frequently-used measures to estimate topological properties of complex networks. 
020       Here we find that the connectivity among a very small portion of the richest nodes can dominate the assortativity and clustering coefficients of a large network, which reveals that the rich-club connectivity is leveraged throughout the network. Our study suggests that more attention should be payed to the organization pattern of rich nodes, for the structure of a complex system as a whole is determined by the associations between the most influential individuals. Moreover, by manipulating the connectivity pattern in a very small rich-club, it is sufficient to produce a network with desired assortativity or transitivity. Conversely, our findings offer a simple explanation for the observed assortativity and transitivity in many real world networks --- such biases can be explained by the connectivities among the richest nodes.

010       Mathematics and Morphogenesis of the City, A Geometrical approach
021       Cities can be compared to living organisms. 
020       They are out of equilibrium, opened systems that never stop developing and sometimes die. The city's growth is guided by needs in local distribution and in communication among its parts. The local geography can be compared to a shell constraining its development. In brief, a city's current layout is a step in a running morphogenesis process. Thus cities display a huge diversity of shapes and none of traditional models from random graphs, complex networks theory or stochastic geometry takes into account geometrical, functional and dynamical aspects of a city in the same framework. We present here a global mathematical model dedicated to cities that permits describing, manipulating and explaining cities' overall shape and layout of their street systems. This streets-based framework includes an algebraic formalism, a static analysis of cities' main features (topology of first and second order, anisotropy, streets scaling) and a dynamical model which from simple general rules can reproduce a large diversity of cities.

010       Complex network model of the phase transition on the wealth   distributions - from Pareto to the society without middle class
021       A model of distribution of the wealth in a society based on the properties of complex networks has been proposed. 
020       The wealth is interpreted as a consequence of communication possibilities and proportional to the number of connections possessed by a person (as a vertex of the social network). Numerical simulation of wealth distribution shows a transition from the Pareto law to distribution with a gap demonstrating the absence of the middle class. Such a transition has been described as a second-order phase transition, the order parameter has been introduced and the value of the critical exponent has been found.

010       Description of stochastic and chaotic series using visibility graphs
021       Nonlinear time series analysis is an active field of research that studies the structure of complex signals in order to derive information of the process that generated those series, for understanding, modeling and forecasting purposes. 
020       In the last years, some methods mapping time series to network representations have been proposed. The purpose is to investigate on the properties of the series through graph theoretical tools recently developed in the core of the celebrated complex network theory. Among some other methods, the so-called visibility algorithm has received much attention, since it has been shown that series correlations are captured by the algorithm and translated in the associated graph, opening the possibility of building fruitful connections between time series analysis, nonlinear dynamics, and graph theory. Here we use the horizontal visibility algorithm to characterize and distinguish between correlated stochastic, uncorrelated and chaotic processes. We show that in every case the series maps into a graph with exponential degree distribution P (k) ~ exp(-{\lambda}k), where the value of {\lambda} characterizes the specific process. The frontier between chaotic and correlated stochastic processes, {\lambda} = ln(3/2), can be calculated exactly, and some other analytical developments confirm the results provided by extensive numerical simulations and (short) experimental time series.

010       Griffiths phases in the contact process on complex networks
021       Dynamical processes occurring on top of complex networks have become an exciting area of research. 
020       Quenched disorder plays a relevant role in general dynamical processes and phase transitions, but the effect of topological quenched disorder on the dynamics of complex networks has not been systematically studied so far. Here, we provide heuristic and numerical analyses of the contact process defined on some complex networks with topological disorder. We report on Griffiths phases and other rare region effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow relaxation in generalized small-world networks. In particular, it is illustrated that Griffiths phases can emerge as the consequence of pure topological heterogeneity if the topological dimension of the network is finite.

010       Spectral Perturbation and Reconstructability of Complex Networks
021       In recent years, many network perturbation techniques, such as topological perturbations and service perturbations, were employed to study and improve the robustness of complex networks. 
020       However, there is no general way to evaluate the network robustness. In this paper, we propose a new global measure for a network, the reconstructability coefficient {\theta}, defined as the maximum number of eigenvalues that can be removed, subject to the condition that the adjacency matrix can be reconstructed exactly. Our main finding is that a linear scaling law, E[{\theta}]=aN, seems universal, in that it holds for all networks that we have studied.

010       On the interaction of a thin, supersonic shell with a molecular cloud
021       Molecular clouds (MCs) are stellar nurseries, however, formation of stars within MCs depends on the ambient physical conditions. 
020       MCs, over a free-fall time are exposed to numerous dynamical phenomena, of which, the interaction with a thin, dense shell of gas is but one. Below we present results from self-gravitating, 3-D smoothed particle hydrodynamics ({\small SPH}) simulations of the problem; seven realisations of the problem have been performed by varying the precollision density within the cloud, the nature of the post-collision shock, and the spatial resolution in the computational domain. Irrespective of the type of shock, a complex network of dense filaments, seeded by numerical noise, readily appears in the shocked cloud. Segregation of the dense and rarefied gas phases also manifests itself in a bimodal distribution of gas density. We demonstrate that the power-spectrum for rarefied gas is Kolomogorov like, while that for the denser gas is considerably steeper. As a corollary to the main problem, we also look into the possibly degenerative effect of the {\small SPH} artificial viscosity on the impact of the incident shell. It is observed that stronger viscosity leads to greater post-shock dissipation, that strongly decelerates the incident shock-front and promotes formation of contiguous structure, albeit on a much longer timescale. We conclude that too much viscosity is likely to enhance the proclivity towards gravitational boundedness of structure, leading to unphysical fragmentation.On the other hand, insufficient resolution appears to suppress fragmentation. Convergence of results is tested at both extremes, first by repeating the test case with more than a million particles and then with only half the number of particles in the original test case.

010       Complex Networks: effect of subtle changes in nature of randomness
021       In two different classes of network models, namely, the Watts Strogatz type and the Euclidean type, subtle changes have been introduced in the randomness. 
020       In the Watts Strogatz type network, rewiring has been done in different ways and although the qualitative results remain same, finite differences in the exponents are observed. In the Euclidean type networks, where at least one finite phase transition occurs, two models differing in a similar way have been considered. The results show a possible shift in one of the phase transition points but no change in the values of the exponents. The WS and Euclidean type models are equivalent for extreme values of the parameters; we compare their behaviour for intermediate values.

010       Random Graph Generator for Bipartite Networks Modeling
021       The purpose of this article is to introduce a new iterative algorithm with properties resembling real life bipartite graphs. 
020       The algorithm enables us to generate wide range of random bigraphs, which features are determined by a set of parameters.We adapt the advances of last decade in unipartite complex networks modeling to the bigraph setting. This data structure can be observed in several situations. However, only a few datasets are freely available to test the algorithms (e.g. community detection, influential nodes identification, information retrieval) which operate on such data. Therefore, artificial datasets are needed to enhance development and testing of the algorithms. We are particularly interested in applying the generator to the analysis of recommender systems. Therefore, we focus on two characteristics that, besides simple statistics, are in our opinion responsible for the performance of neighborhood based collaborative filtering algorithms. The features are node degree distribution and local clustering coeficient.

010       Recurrence-based time series analysis by means of complex network   methods
021       Complex networks are an important paradigm of modern complex systems sciences which allows quantitatively assessing the structural properties of systems composed of different interacting entities. 
020       During the last years, intensive efforts have been spent on applying network-based concepts also for the analysis of dynamically relevant higher-order statistical properties of time series. Notably, many corresponding approaches are closely related with the concept of recurrence in phase space. In this paper, we review recent methodological advances in time series analysis based on complex networks, with a special emphasis on methods founded on recurrence plots. The potentials and limitations of the individual methods are discussed and illustrated for paradigmatic examples of dynamical systems as well as for real-world time series. Complex network measures are shown to provide information about structural features of dynamical systems that are complementary to those characterized by other methods of time series analysis and, hence, substantially enrich the knowledge gathered from other existing (linear as well as nonlinear) approaches.

010       Using topological characteristics to evaluate complex network models can   be misleading
021       Graphical models are frequently used to represent topological structures of various complex networks. 
020       Current criteria to assess different models of a network mainly rely on how close a model matches the network in terms of topological characteristics. Typical topological metrics are clustering coefficient, distance distribution, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix, and the gap between the first and the second largest eigenvalues, which are widely used to evaluate and compare different models of a network. In this paper, we show that evaluating complex network models based on the current topological metrics can be quite misleading. Taking several models of the AS-level Internet as examples, we show that although a model seems to be good to describe the Internet in terms of the aforementioned topological characteristics, it is far from being realistic to represent the real Internet in performances such as robustness in resisting intentional attacks and traffic load distributions. We further show that it is not useful to assess network models by examining some topological characteristics such as clustering coefficient and distance distribution, if robustness of the Internet against random node removals is the only concern. Our findings shed new lights on how to reasonably evaluate different models of a network, not only the Internet but also other types of complex networks.

010       Efficient Triangle Counting in Large Graphs via Degree-based Vertex   Partitioning
021       The number of triangles is a computationally expensive graph statistic which is frequently used in complex network analysis (e.g., transitivity ratio), in various random graph models (e.g., exponential random graph model) and in important real world applications such as spam detection, uncovering of the hidden thematic structure of the Web and link recommendation. 
020       Counting triangles in graphs with millions and billions of edges requires algorithms which run fast, use small amount of space, provide accurate estimates of the number of triangles and preferably are parallelizable. <br />In this paper we present an efficient triangle counting algorithm which can be adapted to the semistreaming model. The key idea of our algorithm is to combine the sampling algorithm of Tsourakakis et al. and the partitioning of the set of vertices into a high degree and a low degree subset respectively as in the Alon, Yuster and Zwick work treating each set appropriately. We obtain a running time $O \left(m + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t \epsilon^2} \right)$ and an $\epsilon$ approximation (multiplicative error), where $n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ the number of edges and $\Delta$ the maximum number of triangles an edge is contained. <br />Furthermore, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to the semistreaming model with space usage $O\left(m^{1/2}\log{n} + \frac{m^{3/2} \Delta \log{n}}{t \epsilon^2} \right)$ and a constant number of passes (three) over the graph stream. We apply our methods in various networks with several millions of edges and we obtain excellent results. Finally, we propose a random projection based method for triangle counting and provide a sufficient condition to obtain an estimate with low variance.

010       Universal fractal scaling of self-organized networks
021       There is an abundance of literature on complex networks describing a variety of relationships among units in social, biological, and technological systems. 
020       Such networks, consisting of interconnected nodes, are often self-organized, naturally emerging without any overarching designs on topological structure yet enabling efficient interactions among nodes. Here we show that the number of nodes and the density of connections in such self-organized networks exhibit a power law relationship. We examined the size and connection density of 47 self-organizing networks of various biological, social, and technological origins, and found that the size-density relationship follows a fractal relationship spanning over 6 orders of magnitude. This finding indicates that there is an optimal connection density in self-organized networks following fractal scaling regardless of their sizes.

010       The Shannon and the Von Neumann entropy of random networks with   heterogeneous expected degree
021       Entropic measures of complexity are able to quantify the information encoded in complex network structures. 
020       Several entropic measures have been proposed in this respect. Here we study the relation between the Shannon entropy and the Von Neumann entropy of networks with a given expected degree sequence. We find in different examples of network topologies that when the degree distribution contains some heterogeneity, an intriguing correlation emerges between the two entropies. This result seems to suggest that this kind of heterogeneity is implying an equivalence between a quantum and a classical description of networks, which respectively correspond to the Von Neumann and the Shannon entropy.

020       A systematic approach is developed for determining appropriate choices of the exponents that can be applied to large complex networks. When the scaling implies subnetworks have different time-scales, the subnetworks can be approximated separately providing insight into the behavior of the full network through the analysis of these lower dimensional approximations.

010       Static and dynamic characteristics of protein contact networks
021       The principles underlying protein folding remains one of Nature's puzzles with important practical consequences for Life. 
020       An approach that has gathered momentum since the late 1990's, looks at protein hetero-polymers and their folding process through the lens of complex network analysis. Consequently, there is now a body of empirical studies describing topological characteristics of protein macro-molecules through their contact networks and linking these topological characteristics to protein folding. The present paper is primarily a review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by emphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional places where "power-laws" may be lurking within protein contact networks. Further, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks. This closer scrutiny of protein contact networks raises new questions for further research, and identifies new regularities which may be useful to parameterize a network approach to protein folding. Preliminary experiments with such a model confirm that the regularities we identified cannot be easily reproduced through random effects. Indeed, the grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate the process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage patterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior of proteins as they fold.

010       Voter models on weighted networks
021       We study the dynamics of the voter and Moran processes running on top of complex network substrates where each edge has a weight depending on the degree of the nodes it connects. 
020       For each elementary dynamical step the first node is chosen at random and the second is selected with probability proportional to the weight of the connecting edge. We present a heterogeneous mean-field approach allowing to identify conservation laws and to calculate exit probabilities along with consensus times. In the specific case when the weight is given by the product of nodes degree raised to a power, theta, we derive a rich phase-diagram, with the consensus time exhibiting various scaling laws depending on theta and on the exponent of the degree distribution, gamma. Numerical simulations give very good agreement for small values of |theta|. An additional analytical treatment (heterogeneous pair approximation) improves the agreement with numerics, but the theoretical understanding of the behavior in the limit of large |theta| remains an open challenge.

010       How Accurate is Mean-Field Theory for Dynamics on Real-World Networks?
021       Mean-field analysis is an important tool for understanding dynamics on complex networks. 
020       However, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the question of whether mean-field predictions are accurate, particularly for real-world networks with clustering and modular structure. We compare mean-field predictions to numerical simulation results for dynamical processes running on 21 real-world networks and demonstrate using synthetic networks that the accuracy of the theory not only depends on the mean degree of the networks but also depends fundamentally on the mean first-neighbor degree. We show, unexpectedly, that mean-field theory can give accurate results for disassortative real-world networks even when the mean degree is as low as $z=4$.

010       Community characterization of heterogeneous complex systems
021       We introduce an analytical statistical method to characterize the communities detected in heterogeneous complex systems. 
020       By posing a suitable null hypothesis, our method makes use of the hypergeometric distribution to assess the probability that a given property is over-expressed in the elements of a community with respect to all the elements of the investigated set. We apply our method to two specific complex networks, namely a network of world movies and a network of physics preprints. The characterization of the elements and of the communities is done in terms of languages and countries for the movie network and of journals and subject categories for papers. We find that our method is able to characterize clearly the identified communities. Moreover our method works well both for large and for small communities.

010       Identifying complex periodic windows in continuous-time dynamical   systems using recurrence-based methods
021       The identification of complex periodic windows in the two-dimensional parameter space of certain dynamical systems has recently attracted considerable interest. 
020       While for discrete systems, a discrimination between periodic and chaotic windows can be easily made based on the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the system, this remains a challenging task for continuous systems, especially if only short time series are available (e.g., in case of experimental data). In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear measures based on recurrence plots obtained from such trajectories provide a practicable alternative for numerically detecting shrimps. Traditional diagonal line-based measures of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) as well as measures from complex network theory are shown to allow an excellent classification of periodic and chaotic behavior in parameter space. Using the well-studied R\"ossler system as a benchmark example, we find that the average path length and the clustering coefficient of the resulting recurrence networks (RNs) are particularly powerful discriminatory statistics for the identification of complex periodic windows.

010       HyperANF: Approximating the Neighbourhood Function of Very Large Graphs   on a Budget
021       The neighbourhood function N(t) of a graph G gives, for each t, the number of pairs of nodes &lt;x, y&gt; such that y is reachable from x in less that t hops. 
020       The neighbourhood function provides a wealth of information about the graph (e.g., it easily allows one to compute its diameter), but it is very expensive to compute it exactly. Recently, the ANF algorithm (approximate neighbourhood function) has been proposed with the purpose of approximating NG(t) on large graphs. We describe a breakthrough improvement over ANF in terms of speed and scalability. Our algorithm, called HyperANF, uses the new HyperLogLog counters and combines them efficiently through broadword programming; our implementation uses overdecomposition to exploit multi-core parallelism. With HyperANF, for the first time we can compute in a few hours the neighbourhood function of graphs with billions of nodes with a small error and good confidence using a standard workstation. Then, we turn to the study of the distribution of the shortest paths between reachable nodes (that can be efficiently approximated by means of HyperANF), and discover the surprising fact that its index of dispersion provides a clear-cut characterisation of proper social networks vs. web graphs. We thus propose the spid (Shortest-Paths Index of Dispersion) of a graph as a new, informative statistics that is able to discriminate between the above two types of graphs. We believe this is the first proposal of a significant new non-local structural index for complex networks whose computation is highly scalable.

010       Limited path entanglement percolation in quantum complex networks
021       We study entanglement distribution in quantum complex networks where nodes are connected by bipartite entangled states. 
020       These networks are characterized by a complex structure, which dramatically affects how information is transmitted through them. For pure quantum state links, quantum networks exhibit a remarkable feature absent in classical networks: it is possible to effectively rewire the network by performing local operations on the nodes. We propose a family of such quantum operations that decrease the entanglement percolation threshold of the network and increase the size of the giant connected component. We provide analytic results for complex networks with arbitrary (uncorrelated) degree distribution. These results are in good agreement with numerical simulations, which also show enhancement in correlated and real world networks. The proposed quantum preprocessing strategies are not robust in the presence of noise. However, even when the links consist of (noisy) mixed state links, one can send quantum information through a connecting path with a fidelity that decreases with the path length. In this noisy scenario, complex networks offer a clear advantage over regular lattices, namely the fact that two arbitrary nodes can be connected through a relatively small number of steps, known as the small world effect. We calculate the probability that two arbitrary nodes in the network can successfully communicate with a fidelity above a given threshold. This amounts to working out the classical problem of percolation with limited path length. We find that this probability can be significant even for paths limited to few connections, and that the results for standard (unlimited) percolation are soon recovered if the path length exceeds by a finite amount the average path length, which in complex networks generally scales logarithmically with the size of the network.

The accuracy of the proposed formalism and corresponding algorithm is numerically confirmed.

010       Enhancing synchronization by directionality in complex networks
021       We proposed a method called residual edge-betweenness gradient (REBG) to enhance synchronizability of networks by assignment of link direction while keeping network topology and link weight unchanged. 
020       Direction assignment has been shown to improve the synchronizability of undirected networks in general, but we find that in some cases incommunicable components emerge and networks fail to synchronize. We show that the REBG method can effectively avoid the synchronization failure ($R=\lambda_{2}^{r}/\lambda_{N}^{r}=0$) which occurs in the residual degree gradient (RDG) method proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 228702 (2009). Further experiments show that REBG method enhance synchronizability in networks with community structure as compared with the RDG method.

010       Exploiting Temporal Complex Network Metrics in Mobile Malware   Containment
021       Malicious mobile phone worms spread between devices via short-range Bluetooth contacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses. 
020       Recent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to analyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These approaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by aggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate representation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently dynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the ordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by existing complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the blocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if carefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is ineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these networks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a patch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and show its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness allows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show that this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and associated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the malware in a limited amount of time.

010       Flow graphs: interweaving dynamics and structure
021       The behavior of complex systems is determined not only by the topological organization of their interconnections but also by the dynamical processes taking place among their constituents. 
020       A faithful modeling of the dynamics is essential because different dynamical processes may be affected very differently by network topology. A full characterization of such systems thus requires a formalization that encompasses both aspects simultaneously, rather than relying only on the topological adjacency matrix. To achieve this, we introduce the concept of flow graphs, namely weighted networks where dynamical flows are embedded into the link weights. Flow graphs provide an integrated representation of the structure and dynamics of the system, which can then be analyzed with standard tools from network theory. Conversely, a structural network feature of our choice can also be used as the basis for the construction of a flow graph that will then encompass a dynamics biased by such a feature. We illustrate the ideas by focusing on the mathematical properties of generic linear processes on complex networks that can be represented as biased random walks and also explore their dual consensus dynamics.

010       Clustering Drives Assortativity and Community Structure in Ensembles of   Networks
021       Clustering, assortativity, and communities are key features of complex networks. 
020       We probe dependencies between these attributes and find that ensembles with strong clustering display both high assortativity by degree and prominent community structure, while ensembles with high assortativity are much less biased towards clustering or community structure. Further, clustered networks can amplify small homophilic bias for trait assortativity. This marked asymmetry suggests that transitivity, rather than homophily, drives the standard nonsocial/social network dichotomy.

010       A Survey on Cross-Layer Design Frameworks for Multimedia Applications   over Wireless Networks
021       In the last few years, the Internet throughput, usage and reliability have increased almost exponentially. 
020       The introduction of broadband wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased computational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be created, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time multimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly challenging task since these applications have strict quality -of-service (QoS) requirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional IP-based best effort service will not be able to meet these stringent requirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource constrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve perceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can be addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer and link layer. Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this adaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless medium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that the rate, power, and coding at the physical layer can adapted to meet the requirements of the applications given the current channel and network conditions. A number of propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the literature. In this paper, an extensive review has been made on these cross-layer architectures that combine the application-layer, transport layer and the link layer controls. Particularly the issues like channel estimation techniques, adaptive controls at the application and link layers for energy efficiency, priority based scheduling, transmission rate control at the transport layer, and adaptive automatic repeat request (ARQ) are discussed in detail.

010       Role-based similarity in directed networks
021       The widespread relevance of increasingly complex networks requires methods to extract meaningful coarse-grained representations of such systems. 
020       For undirected graphs, standard community detection methods use criteria largely based on density of connections to provide such representations. We propose a method for grouping nodes in directed networks based on the role of the nodes in the network, understood in terms of patterns of incoming and outgoing flows. The role groupings are obtained through the clustering of a similarity matrix, formed by the distances between feature vectors that contain the number of in and out paths of all lengths for each node. Hence nodes operating in a similar flow environment are grouped together although they may not themselves be densely connected. Our method, which includes a scale factor that reveals robust groupings based on increasingly global structure, provides an alternative criterion to uncover structure in networks where there is an implicit flow transfer in the system. We illustrate its application to a variety of data from ecology, world trade and cellular metabolism.

010       Colored motifs reveal computational building blocks in the C. elegans   brain
021       Complex networks can often be decomposed into less complex sub-networks whose structures can give hints about the functional organization of the network as a whole. 
020       However, these structural motifs can only tell one part of the functional story because in this analysis each node and edge is treated on an equal footing. In real networks, two motifs that are topologically identical but whose nodes perform very different functions will play very different roles in the network. Here, we combine structural information derived from the topology of the neuronal network of the nematode C. elegans with information about the biological function of these nodes, thus coloring nodes by function. We discover that particular colorations of motifs are significantly more abundant in the worm brain than expected by chance, and have particular computational functions that emphasize the feed-forward structure of information processing in the network, while evading feedback loops. Interneurons are strongly over-represented among the common motifs, supporting the notion that these motifs process and transduce the information from the sensor neurons towards the muscles. Some of the most common motifs identified in the search for significant colored motifs play a crucial role in the system of neurons controlling the worm's locomotion. The analysis of complex networks in terms of colored motifs combines two independent data sets to generate insight about these networks that cannot be obtained with either data set alone. The method is general and should allow a decomposition of any complex network into its functional (rather than topological) motifs as long as both wiring and functional information is available.

010       Horizontal visibility graphs transformed from fractional Brownian   motions: Topological properties versus Hurst index
021       Nonlinear time series analysis aims at understanding the dynamics of stochastic or chaotic processes. 
020       In recent years, quite a few methods have been proposed to transform a single time series to a complex network so that the dynamics of the process can be understood by investigating the topological properties of the network. We study the topological properties of horizontal visibility graphs constructed from fractional Brownian motions with different Hurst index $H\in(0,1)$. Special attention has been paid to the impact of Hurst index on the topological properties. It is found that the clustering coefficient $C$ decreases when $H$ increases. We also found that the mean length $L$ of the shortest paths increases exponentially with $H$ for fixed length $N$ of the original time series. In addition, $L$ increases linearly with respect to $N$ when $H$ is close to 1 and in a logarithmic form when $H$ is close to 0. Although the occurrence of different motifs changes with $H$, the motif rank pattern remains unchanged for different $H$. Adopting the node-covering box-counting method, the horizontal visibility graphs are found to be fractals and the fractal dimension $d_B$ decreases with $H$. Furthermore, the Pearson coefficients of the networks are positive and the degree-degree correlations increase with the degree, which indicate that the horizontal visibility graphs are assortative. With the increase of $H$, the Pearson coefficient decreases first and then increases, in which the turning point is around $H=0.6$. The presence of both fractality and assortativity in the horizontal visibility graphs converted from fractional Brownian motions is different from many cases where fractal networks are usually disassortative.

010       Fractal Analysis on Human Behaviors Dynamics
021       The study of human dynamics has attracted much interest from many fields recently. 
020       In this paper, the fractal characteristic of human behaviors is investigated from the perspective of time series constructed with the amount of library loans. The Hurst exponents and length of non-periodic cycles calculated through Rescaled Range Analysis indicate that the time series of human behaviors is fractal with long-range correlation. Then the time series are converted to complex networks by visibility graph algorithm. The topological properties of the networks, such as scale-free property, small-world effect and hierarchical structure imply that close relationships exist between the amounts of repetitious actions performed by people during certain periods of time, especially for some important days. Finally, the networks obtained are verified to be not fractal and self-similar using box-counting method. Our work implies the intrinsic regularity shown in human collective repetitious behaviors.

010       Heterogeneous-k-core versus Bootstrap Percolation on Complex Networks
021       We introduce the heterogeneous-$k$-core, which generalizes the $k$-core, and contrast it with bootstrap percolation. 
020       Vertices have a threshold $k_i$ which may be different at each vertex. If a vertex has less than $k_i$ neighbors it is pruned from the network. The heterogeneous-$k$-core is the sub-graph remaining after no further vertices can be pruned. If the thresholds $k_i$ are $1$ with probability $f$ or $k \geq 3$ with probability $(1-f)$, the process forms one branch of an activation-pruning process which demonstrates hysteresis. The other branch is formed by ordinary bootstrap percolation. We show that there are two types of transitions in this heterogeneous-$k$-core process: the giant heterogeneous-$k$-core may appear with a continuous transition and there may be a second, discontinuous, hybrid transition. We compare critical phenomena, critical clusters and avalanches at the heterogeneous-$k$-core and bootstrap percolation transitions. We also show that network structure has a crucial effect on these processes, with the giant heterogeneous-$k$-core appearing immediately at a finite value for any $f &gt; 0$ when the degree distribution tends to a power law $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma &lt; 3$.

010       Selection in Scientific Networks
021       One of the most interesting scientific challenges nowadays deals with the analysis and the understanding of complex networks' dynamics. 
020       A major issue is the definition of new frameworks for the exploration of the dynamics at play in real dynamic networks. Here, we focus on scientific communities by analyzing the "social part" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at identifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the patterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of the arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics. As a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a work in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between co-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most proficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how these patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a selection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of individuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order to advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and scientists working on them. The dataset is analyzed a) at a global level, e.g. the network evolution, b) at the meso-level, e.g. communities emergence, and c) at a micro-level, e.g. nodes' aggregation patterns.

010       The interplay of microscopic and mesoscopic structure in complex   networks
021       Not all nodes in a network are created equal. 
020       Differences and similarities exist at both individual node and group levels. Disentangling single node from group properties is crucial for network modeling and structural inference. Based on unbiased generative probabilistic exponential random graph models and employing distributive message passing techniques, we present an efficient algorithm that allows one to separate the contributions of individual nodes and groups of nodes to the network structure. This leads to improved detection accuracy of latent class structure in real world data sets compared to models that focus on group structure alone. Furthermore, the inclusion of hitherto neglected group specific effects in models used to assess the statistical significance of small subgraph (motif) distributions in networks may be sufficient to explain most of the observed statistics. We show the predictive power of such generative models in forecasting putative gene-disease associations in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. The approach is suitable for both directed and undirected uni-partite as well as for bipartite networks.

010       Vulnerability Analysis for Complex Networks Using Aggressive Abstraction
021       Large, complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and society, and there is great interest in developing rigorous, scalable methods for identifying and characterizing their vulnerabilities. 
020       This paper presents an approach for analyzing the dynamics of complex networks in which the network of interest is first abstracted to a much simpler, but mathematically equivalent, representation, the required analysis is performed on the abstraction, and analytic conclusions are then mapped back to the original network and interpreted there. We begin by identifying a broad and important class of complex networks which admit vulnerability-preserving, finite state abstractions, and develop efficient algorithms for computing these abstractions. We then propose a vulnerability analysis methodology which combines these finite state abstractions with formal analytics from theoretical computer science to yield a comprehensive vulnerability analysis process for networks of realworld scale and complexity. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study involving a realistic electric power grid model and also with brief discussions of biological and social network examples.

010       Evolution of Chinese airport network
021       With the rapid development of economy and the accelerated globalization process, the aviation industry plays more and more critical role in today's world, in both developed and developing countries. 
020       As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN remains steady during the past several years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which changes the relative relevance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic keeps growing in an exponential form and it has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities.

010       Towards Decentralized Trading: A Topological Investigation of the Dutch   Medium and Low Voltage Grids
021       The traditional Power Grid has been designed in a hierarchical fashion, with Energy pushed from the large scale production facilities towards the end users. 
020       But with the increasing availability of micro and medium scale generating facilities, the situation is changing. Many end users can now produce energy and share it over the Power Grid. Naturally, end users need to have incentives to do so and might want to be able to act in an open decentralized energy market. In the present work, we offer a novel analysis of the Medium and Low Voltage Power Grids of the North Netherlands using statistical tools from the Complex Network Analysis field. We use a weighted model based on actual Grid data and propose a set of statistical measures to evaluate the adequacy of the current infrastructure for a decentralized energy market. Further, we use the insight gained by the analysis to propose parameters that tie the statistical topological measures to economic factors that might influence the attractiveness to the end users in participating in such a decentralized energy market, thus identifying what are the important topological parameters to work on to facilitate such open decentralized markets.

010       The Universality of the Attractiveness Model to Weighted Networks
021       In the study of complex networks, weighted networks have attracted more and more interests due to they can better describe the networks in real life. 
020       Through theoretical analysis, this paper find the universality of attractiveness model to weighted network, that is to say, the evolving mechanism of weighted network can be seen as a special case of attractiveness model. Then the relation between parameters in BBV weighted networks and attractiveness factor in attractiveness model is obtained. So we can use the expression of degree distribution of attractiveness model to calculate the one of weighted network directly, and the numerical simulation of degree distribution verified the validity of academic result. Furthermore, a comprehensive simulation of clustering coefficient shows the regular pattern of it varies with the changing of network parameters such as the size of network, updating coefficient, original weight and attractiveness. Specially, we point out that the original weight play the same important role as updating coefficient in influencing the topological characteristics of networks, which has been neglected before by other scholars.

010       Detecting Important Nodes to Community Structure Using the Spectrum of   the Graph
021       Community structure analysis is a powerful tool for complex networks, which can simplify their functional analysis considerably. 
020       Many approaches have recently been proposed to the communities in complex networks, but a method to characterize the node importance to communities is still lacking. In this paper a centrality metric is proposed to measure the importance of network nodes to community structure using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. We define the node importance to communities as the relative change in the eigenvalues of the network adjacency matrix upon their removal. Besides that, we also propose an index to distinguish two kind of important nodes in communities, ie. "community core" and "bridge". The method has been tested in many artificial and real-world networks. The results show that our method preforms well in many cases, including artificial networks and many real-world networks.

021       Unsupervised clustering, also known as natural clustering, stands for the classification of data according to their similarities. 
020       Here we study this problem from the perspective of complex networks. Mapping the description of data similarities to graphs, we propose to extend two multiresolution modularity based algorithms to the finding of modules (clusters) in general data sets producing a multiscales' solution. We show the performance of these reported algorithms to the classification of a standard benchmark of data clustering and compare their performance.

010       Reliability of optimal linear projection of growing scale-free networks
021       Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a technique based on linear projection theory, which has been frequently used for data analysis. 
020       It constitutes an optimal (in the sense of least squares) decomposition of a matrix in the most relevant directions of the data variance. Usually, this information is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data set in a few principal projection directions, this is called Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD). In situations where the data is continuously changing the projection might become obsolete. Since the change rate of data can be fast, it is an interesting question whether the TSVD projection of the initial data is reliable. In the case of complex networks, this scenario is particularly important when considering network growth. Here we study the reliability of the TSVD projection of growing scale free networks, monitoring its evolution at global and local scales.

010       Valued Ties Tell Fewer Lies, II: Why Not To Dichotomize Network Edges   With Bounded Outdegrees
021       Various methods have been proposed for creating a binary version of a complex network with valued ties. 
020       Rather than the default method of choosing a single threshold value about which to dichotomize, we consider a method of choosing the highest k outbound arcs from each person and assigning a binary tie, as this has the advantage of minimizing the isolation of nodes that may otherwise be weakly connected. However, simulations and real data sets establish that this method is worse than the default thresholding method and should not be generally considered to deal with valued networks.

010       Complex networks with arbitrary edge multiplicities
021       One of the main characteristics of real-world networks is their large clustering. 
020       Clustering is one aspect of a more general but much less studied structural organization of networks, i.e. edge multiplicity, defined as the number of triangles in which edges, rather than vertices, participate. Here we show that the multiplicity distribution of real networks is in many cases scale-free, and in general very broad. Thus, besides the fact that in real networks the number of edges attached to vertices often has a scale-free distribution, we find that the number of vertices attached to edges can have a scale-free distribution as well. We show that current models, even when they generate clustered networks, systematically fail to reproduce the observed multiplicity distributions. We therefore propose a generalized model that can reproduce networks with arbitrary distributions of vertex degrees and edge multiplicities, and study many of its properties analytically.

010       Continuous-Time Quantum Walks: Models for Coherent Transport on Complex   Networks
021       This paper reviews recent advances in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) and their application to transport in various systems. 
020       The introduction gives a brief survey of the historical background of CTQW. After a short outline of the theoretical ideas behind CTQW and of its relation to classical continuous-time random walks (CTRW) in Sec.~2, implications for the efficiency of the transport are presented in Sec.~3. The fourth section gives an overview of different types of networks on which CTQW have been studied so far. Extensions of CTQW to systems with long-range interactions and with static disorder are discussed in section V. Systems with traps, i.e., systems in which the walker's probability to remain inside the system is not conserved, are presented in section IV. Relations to similar approaches to the transport are studied in section VII. The paper closes with an outlook on possible future directions.

010       Complex networks and glassy dynamics: walks in the energy landscape
021       We present a simple mathematical framework for the description of the dynamics of glassy systems in terms of a random walk in a complex energy landscape pictured as a network of minima. 
020       We show how to use the tools developed for the study of dynamical processes on complex networks, in order to go beyond mean-field models that consider that all minima are connected to each other. We consider several possibilities for the transition rates between minima, and show that in all cases the existence of a glassy phase depends on a delicate interplay between the network's topology and the relationship between energy and degree of a minimum. Interestingly, the network's degree correlations and the details of the transition rates do not play any role in the existence (nor in the value) of the transition temperature, but have an impact only on more involved properties. For Glauber or Metropolis rates in particular, we find that the low-temperature phase can be further divided into two regions with different scaling properties of the average trapping time. Overall, our results rationalize and link the empirical findings about correlations between the energy of the minima and their degree, and should stimulate further investigations on this issue.

010       Who is the best player ever? A complex network analysis of the history   of professional tennis
021       We consider all matches played by professional tennis players between 1968 and 2010, and, on the basis of this data set, construct a directed and weighted network of contacts. 
020       The resulting graph shows complex features, typical of many real networked systems studied in literature. We develop a diffusion algorithm and apply it to the tennis contact network in order to rank professional players. Jimmy Connors is identified as the best player of the history of tennis according to our ranking procedure. We perform a complete analysis by determining the best players on specific playing surfaces as well as the best ones in each of the years covered by the data set. The results of our technique are compared to those of two other well established methods. In general, we observe that our ranking method performs better: it has a higher predictive power and does not require the arbitrary introduction of external criteria for the correct assessment of the quality of players. The present work provides a novel evidence of the utility of tools and methods of network theory in real applications.

We are especially focused on what the software developer context encompasses at the project level and how it can be captured. The experimental work done so far show that useful context information can be extracted from project management tools. The extraction, analysis and availability of this context information can be used to enrich the work environment of the developer with additional knowledge to support her/his work.

010       Consistently weighted measures for complex network topologies
021       When network and graph theory are used in the study of complex systems, a typically finite set of nodes of the network under consideration is frequently either explicitly or implicitly considered representative of a much larger finite or infinite set of objects of interest. 
020       The selection procedure, e.g., formation of a subset or some kind of discretization or aggregation, typically results in individual nodes of the studied network representing quite differently sized parts of the domain of interest. This heterogeneity may induce substantial bias and artifacts in derived network statistics. To avoid this bias, we propose an axiomatic scheme based on the idea of {\em node splitting invariance} to derive consistently weighted variants of various commonly used statistical network measures. The practical relevance and applicability of our approach is demonstrated for a number of example networks from different fields of research, and is shown to be of fundamental importance in particular in the study of climate networks.

010       Excitation transfer through open quantum networks: a few basic   mechanisms
021       A variety of open quantum networks are currently under intense examination to model energy transport in photosynthetic systems. 
020       Here we study the coherent transfer of a quantum excitation over a network incoherently coupled with a structured and small environment that effectively models the photosynthetic reaction center. Our goal is to distill a few basic, possibly universal, mechanisms or "effects" that are featured in simple energy-transfer models. In particular, we identify three different phenomena: the congestion effect, the asymptotic unitarity and the staircase effects. We begin with few-site models, in which these effects can be fully understood, and then proceed to study more complex networks similar to those employed to model energy transfer in light-harvesting complexes. Our numerical studies on such networks seem to suggest that some of the effects observed in simple networks may be of relevance for biological systems, or artificial analogues of them as well.

010       Infinite Multiple Membership Relational Modeling for Complex Networks
021       Learning latent structure in complex networks has become an important problem fueled by many types of networked data originating from practically all fields of science. 
020       In this paper, we propose a new non-parametric Bayesian multiple-membership latent feature model for networks. Contrary to existing multiple-membership models that scale quadratically in the number of vertices the proposed model scales linearly in the number of links admitting multiple-membership analysis in large scale networks. We demonstrate a connection between the single membership relational model and multiple membership models and show on "real" size benchmark network data that accounting for multiple memberships improves the learning of latent structure as measured by link prediction while explicitly accounting for multiple membership result in a more compact representation of the latent structure of networks.

010       A Complex Networks Approach for Data Clustering
021       Many methods have been developed for data clustering, such as k-means, expectation maximization and algorithms based on graph theory. 
020       In this latter case, graphs are generally constructed by taking into account the Euclidian distance as a similarity measure, and partitioned using spectral methods. However, these methods are not accurate when the clusters are not well separated. In addition, it is not possible to automatically determine the number of clusters. These limitations can be overcome by taking into account network community identification algorithms. In this work, we propose a methodology for data clustering based on complex networks theory. We compare different metrics for quantifying the similarity between objects and take into account three community finding techniques. This approach is applied to two real-world databases and to two sets of artificially generated data. By comparing our method with traditional clustering approaches, we verify that the proximity measures given by the Chebyshev and Manhattan distances are the most suitable metrics to quantify the similarity between objects. In addition, the community identification method based on the greedy optimization provides the smallest misclassification rates.

010       Pop. III stars from turbulent fragmentation at redshift ~ 11
021       We report results from a cosmological simulation with non-equilibrium chemistry of 21 species, including H2, HD, and LiH molecular cooling. 
020       Starting from cosmological initial conditions, we focus on the evolution of the central 1.8 Kpc region of a 3 x 10^7 Msun halo. The crossing of a few 10^6 Msun halos and the gas accretion through larger scale filaments generate a turbulent environment within this region. Due to the short cooling time caused by the non-equilibrium formation of H2, the supersonic turbulence results in a very fragmented mass distribution, where dense, gravitationally unstable clumps emerge from a complex network of dense filaments. At z=10.87, we find approximately 25 well defined, gravitationally unstable clumps, with masses of 4 x 10^3-9 x 10^5 Msun, temperatures of approximately 300K, and cooling times much shorter than the free-fall time. Only the initial phase of the collapse of individual clumps is spatially resolved in the simulation. Depending on the density reached in the collapse, the estimated average Bonnor-Ebert masses are in the range 200-800 Msun. We speculate that each clump may further fragment into a cluster of stars with a characteristic mass in the neighborhood of 50 Msun. This process at z ~ 11 may represent the dominant mode of Pop. III star formation, causing a rapid chemical enrichment of the protogalactic environment.

010       How Many Nodes are Effectively Accessed in Complex Networks?
021       The accessibility has been proposed as a measurement of the efficiency of the communication between nodes in complex networks. 
020       The current work provides important results regarding the properties of the accessibility, including its relationship with the average minimal time $\tau$ to visit all nodes reachable after $h$ steps from a source, as well as the number of nodes that are visited after a finite period of time. Such a relationship is investigated with respect to three types of dynamics, namely: traditional random walks, self-avoiding random walks, and preferential random walks. We present the bounds of the relationship between the accessibility and $\tau$, conjecture that the maximum accessibility implies minimal exploration time, and confirm the relationship between the accessibility values and the number of nodes visited after a basic time unit.

010       Modular organization enhances the robustness of attractor network   dynamics
021       Modular organization characterizes many complex networks occurring in nature, including the brain. 
020       In this paper we show that modular structure may be responsible for increasing the robustness of certain dynamical states of such systems. In a neural network model with threshold-activated binary elements, we observe that the basins of attractors, corresponding to patterns that have been embedded using a learning rule, occupy maximum volume in phase space at an optimal modularity. Simultaneously, the convergence time to these attractors decreases as a result of cooperative dynamics between the modules. The role of modularity in increasing global stability of certain desirable attractors of a system may provide a clue to its evolution and ubiquity in natural systems.

020       In particular, we develop an analytic theory establishing that the dynamical correlation matrix, constructed purely from measured time series, can be manipulated to yield both the network topology and the amount of time delay simultaneously. Extensive numerical support is provided to validate the method. Our method provides a viable solution to the network inverse problem in fields where predicting unknown, time-delay coupled complex networks of arbitrary topology is of broad interest.

010       Automatic Network Fingerprinting through Single-Node Motifs
021       Complex networks have been characterised by their specific connectivity patterns (network motifs), but their building blocks can also be identified and described by node-motifs---a combination of local network features. 
020       One technique to identify single node-motifs has been presented by Costa et al. (L. D. F. Costa, F. A. Rodrigues, C. C. Hilgetag, and M. Kaiser, Europhys. Lett., 87, 1, 2009). Here, we first suggest improvements to the method including how its parameters can be determined automatically. Such automatic routines make high-throughput studies of many networks feasible. Second, the new routines are validated in different network-series. Third, we provide an example of how the method can be used to analyse network time-series. In conclusion, we provide a robust method for systematically discovering and classifying characteristic nodes of a network. In contrast to classical motif analysis, our approach can identify individual components (here: nodes) that are specific to a network. Such special nodes, as hubs before, might be found to play critical roles in real-world networks.

010       Emergence through Selection: The Evolution of a Scientific Challenge
021       One of the most interesting scientific challenges nowadays deals with the analysis and the understanding of complex networks' dynamics and how their processes lead to emergence according to the interactions among their components. 
020       In this paper we approach the definition of new methodologies for the visualization and the exploration of the dynamics at play in real dynamic social networks. We present a recently introduced formalism called TVG (for time-varying graphs), which was initially developed to model and analyze highly-dynamic and infrastructure-less communication networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, or vehicular networks. We discuss its applicability to complex networks in general, and social networks in particular, by showing how it enables the specification and analysis of complex dynamic phenomena in terms of temporal interactions, and allows to easily switch the perspective between local and global dynamics. As an example, we chose the case of scientific communities by analyzing portion of the ArXiv repository (ten years of publications in physics) focusing on the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates, select and refers to. In the paper we show the emergence/selection of a community as a goal-driven preferential attachment toward a set of authors among which there are some key scientists (Nobel prizes).

010       Wikipedia information flow analysis reveals the scale-free architecture   of the Semantic Space
021       In this paper we extract the topology of the semantic space in its encyclopedic acception, measuring the semantic flow between the different entries of the largest modern encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and thus creating a directed complex network of semantic flows. 
020       Notably at the percolation threshold the semantic space is characterised by scale-free behaviour at different levels of complexity and this relates the semantic space to a wide range of biological, social and linguistics phenomena. In particular we find that the cluster size distribution, representing the size of different semantic areas, is scale-free. Moreover the topology of the resulting semantic space is scale-free in the connectivity distribution and displays small-world properties. However its statistical properties do not allow a classical interpretation via a generative model based on a simple multiplicative process. After giving a detailed description and interpretation of the topological properties of the semantic space, we introduce a stochastic model of content-based network, based on a copy and mutation algorithm and on the Heaps' law, that is able to capture the main statistical properties of the analysed semantic space, including the Zipf's law for the word frequency distribution.

010       Criterion for explosive percolation transitions on complex networks
021       In a recent Letter, Friedman and Landsberg discussed the underlying mechanism of explosive phase transitions on complex networks [Phys. 
020       Rev. Lett. 103, 255701 (2009)]. This Brief Report presents a modest, though more insightful extension of their arguments. We discuss the implications of their results on the cluster-size distribution and deduce that, under general conditions, the percolation transition will be explosive if the mean number of nodes per cluster diverges in the thermodynamic limit and prior to the transition threshold. In other words, if, upon increase of the network size n the amount of clusters in the network does not grow proportionally to n, the percolation transition is explosive. Simulations and analytical calculations on various models support our findings.

010       Structural and functional networks in complex systems with delay
021       Functional networks of complex systems are obtained from the analysis of the temporal activity of their components, and are often used to infer their unknown underlying connectivity. 
020       We obtain the equations relating topology and function in a system of diffusively delay-coupled elements in complex networks. We solve exactly the resulting equations in motifs (directed structures of three nodes), and in directed networks. The mean-field solution for directed uncorrelated networks shows that the clusterization of the activity is dominated by the in-degree of the nodes, and that the locking frequency decreases with increasing average degree. We find that the exponent of a power law degree distribution of the structural topology, b, is related to the exponent of the associated functional network as a =1/(2-b), for b &lt; 2.

010       Efficient routing strategies in scale-free networks with limited   bandwidth
021       We study the traffic dynamics in complex networks where each link is assigned a limited and identical bandwidth. 
020       Although the first-in-first-out (FIFO) queuing rule is widely applied in the routing protocol of information packets, here we argue that if we drop this rule, the overall throughput of the network can be remarkably enhanced. We proposed some efficient routing strategies that do not strictly obey the FIFO rule. Comparing with the routine shortest path strategy, the throughput for both Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) networks and the real Internet, the throughput can be improved more than five times. We calculate the theoretical limitation of the throughput. In BA networks, our proposed strategy can achieve 88% of the theoretical optimum, yet for the real Internet, it is about 12%, implying that we have a huge space to further improve the routing strategy for the real Internet. Finally we discuss possibly promising ways to design more efficient routing strategies for the Internet.

020       The transport on networks is modelled using random walks and we compute the probability for the occurance and recurrence of extreme events on the network. We show that the nodes with smaller number of links are more prone to extreme events than the ones with larger number of links. We obtain analytical estimates and verify them with numerical simulations. They are shown to be robust even when random walkers follow shortest path on the network. The results suggest a revision of design principles and can be used as an input for designing the nodes of a network so as to smoothly handle an extreme event.

010       The Geometry of Chaotic Dynamics -- A Complex Network Perspective
021       Recently, several complex network approaches to time series analysis have been developed and applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as real-world data, e.g., geophysical or financial time series. 
020       Among these techniques, recurrence-based concepts and prominently $\epsilon$-recurrence networks, most faithfully represent the geometrical fine structure of the attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestingly non-chaotic) time series. In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graph theoretical properties local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity can meaningfully be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimension in phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global upper and lower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as numerical results for self-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems suggest that these measures are well-behaved in most non-pathological situations and that they can be estimated reasonably well using $\epsilon$-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short time series. Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity dimensions on the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension or local Lyapunov dimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence that the local clustering coefficients, or equivalently the local clustering dimensions, are useful for identifying unstable periodic orbits and other dynamically invariant objects from time series. Our results demonstrate that $\epsilon$-recurrence networks exhibit an important link between dynamical systems and graph theory.

010       Egomunities, Exploring Socially Cohesive Person-based Communities
021       In the last few years, there has been a great interest in detecting overlapping communities in complex networks, which is understood as dense groups of nodes featuring a low outbound density. 
020       To date, most methods used to compute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by either extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by attempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly overlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by introducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The cohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the notions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of the classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion if it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with the rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of communities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new approach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept of ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node, specifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a heuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to maximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a detailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We finally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as information inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible extension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.

010       Investigating the topology of interacting networks - Theory and   application to coupled climate subnetworks
021       Network theory provides various tools for investigating the structural or functional topology of many complex systems found in nature, technology and society. 
020       Nevertheless, it has recently been realised that a considerable number of systems of interest should be treated, more appropriately, as interacting networks or networks of networks. Here we introduce a novel graph-theoretical framework for studying the interaction structure between subnetworks embedded within a complex network of networks. This framework allows us to quantify the structural role of single vertices or whole subnetworks with respect to the interaction of a pair of subnetworks on local, mesoscopic and global topological scales. <br />Climate networks have recently been shown to be a powerful tool for the analysis of climatological data. Applying the general framework for studying interacting networks, we introduce coupled climate subnetworks to represent and investigate the topology of statistical relationships between the fields of distinct climatological variables. Using coupled climate subnetworks to investigate the terrestrial atmosphere's three-dimensional geopotential height field uncovers known as well as interesting novel features of the atmosphere's vertical stratification and general circulation. Specifically, the new measure "cross-betweenness" identifies regions which are particularly important for mediating vertical wind field interactions. The promising results obtained by following the coupled climate subnetwork approach present a first step towards an improved understanding of the Earth system and its complex interacting components from a network perspective.

010       Onset Synchronization in Weighted Complex Networks: the Effect of   Weight-Degree Correlation
021       By numerical simulations, we compare the onset synchronization of networked phase oscillators under two different weighting schemes. 
020       In scheme-I the link weight is proportional to the degrees of the link ending nodes, and is named as the weight-degree correlated (WDC) network; in scheme-II the link weight is distributed randomly regardless of the node degrees, and is named as the weight-degree uncorrelated (WDU) network. We find that by increasing a parameter that governs the weight distribution, the onset synchronization in WDC network is monotonically enhanced, while in WDU network there is a reverse in the synchronization performance. We explain this phenomenon from the viewpoint of gradient network, and obtain the contrary roles of coupling gradient on network synchronization: gradient promotes synchronization in WDC network, while deteriorating synchronization in WDU network. The findings highlight the fact that, besides the link weight, the correlation between the weight and node degree is also important to the network dynamics.

010       Dengue epidemics and human mobility
021       In this work we explore the effects of human mobility on the dispersion of a vector borne disease. 
020       We combine an already presented stochastic model for dengue with a simple representation of the daily motion of humans on a schematic city of 20x20 blocks with 100 inhabitants in each block. The pattern of motion of the individuals is described in terms of complex networks in which links connect different blocks and the link length distribution is in accordance with recent findings on human mobility. It is shown that human mobility can turn out to be the main driving force of the disease dispersal.

010       Axiomatic Ranking of Network Role Similarity
021       A key task in social network and other complex network analysis is role analysis: describing and categorizing nodes according to how they interact with other nodes. 
020       Two nodes have the same role if they interact with equivalent sets of neighbors. The most fundamental role equivalence is automorphic equivalence. Unfortunately, the fastest algorithms known for graph automorphism are nonpolynomial. Moreover, since exact equivalence may be rare, a more meaningful task is to measure the role similarity between any two nodes. This task is closely related to the structural or link-based similarity problem that SimRank attempts to solve. However, SimRank and most of its offshoots are not sufficient because they do not fully recognize automorphically or structurally equivalent nodes. In this paper we tackle two problems. First, what are the necessary properties for a role similarity measure or metric? Second, how can we derive a role similarity measure satisfying these properties? For the first problem, we justify several axiomatic properties necessary for a role similarity measure or metric: range, maximal similarity, automorphic equivalence, transitive similarity, and the triangle inequality. For the second problem, we present RoleSim, a new similarity metric with a simple iterative computational method. We rigorously prove that RoleSim satisfies all the axiomatic properties. We also introduce an iceberg RoleSim algorithm which can guarantee to discover all pairs with RoleSim score no less than a user-defined threshold $\theta$ without computing the RoleSim for every pair. We demonstrate the superior interpretative power of RoleSim on both both synthetic and real datasets.

010       Explosive Synchronization Transitions in Scale-free Networks
021       The emergence of explosive collective phenomena has recently attracted much attention due to the discovery of an explosive percolation transition in complex networks. 
020       In this Letter, we demonstrate how an explosive transition shows up in the synchronization of complex heterogeneous networks by incorporating a microscopic correlation between the structural and the dynamical properties of the system. The characteristics of this explosive transition are analytically studied in a star graph reproducing the results obtained in synthetic scale-free networks. Our findings represent the first abrupt synchronization transition in complex networks thus providing a deeper understanding of the microscopic roots of explosive critical phenomena.

010       Close or connected? Distance and connectivity effects on transport in   networks
021       We develop an analytical approach which provides the dependence of the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for random walks on complex networks both on the target connectivity and on the source-target distance. 
020       Our approach puts forward two strongly different behaviors depending on the type - compact or non compact - of the random walk. In the case of non compact exploration, we show that the MFPT scales linearly with the inverse connectivity of the target, and is largely independent of the starting point. On the contrary, in the compact case the MFPT is controlled by the source-target distance, and we find that unexpectedly the target connectivity becomes irrelevant for remote targets.

010       Specifying Data Bases Management Systems by Using RM-ODP Engineering   Language
021       Distributed systems can be very large and complex. 
020       The various considerations that influence their design can result in a substantial specification, which requires a structured framework that has to be managed successfully. The purpose of the RMODP is to define such a framework. The Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) provides a framework within which support of distribution, inter-working and portability can be integrated. It defines: an object model, architectural concepts and architecture for the development of ODP systems in terms of five viewpoints. Which include an information viewpoint. Since the usage of Data bases management systems (DBMS) in complex networks is increasing considerably, we are interested, in our work, in giving DBMS specifications through the use of the three schemas (static, dynamic, invariant). The present paper is organized as follows. After a literature review, we will describe then the subset of concepts considered in this work named the database management system (DBMS) object model. In the third section, we will be interested in the engineering language and DMBS structure by describing essentially DBMS objects. Finally, we will present DBMS engineering specifications and makes the connection between models and their instances. This introduces the basic form of the semantic approach we have described here.

010       Extracting topological features from dynamical measures in complex   networks of Kuramoto oscillators
021       Kuramoto model for an ensemble of coupled oscillators provides one of the paradigmatic examples of non-equilibrium transitions between an incoherent state and a synchronized one. 
020       Here we analyze populations of almost identical oscillators, on an arbitrary connectivity pattern. On a heterogeneous network the global dynamics is not only affected by the frequency distribution, but it is also important where the different frequencies are located. In particular, the local topology plays a very important role, affecting the critical behavior of the system. Our aim is to take advantage of this fact and extract topological features of the connectivity pattern from dynamical measures. In order to carry out a quantitative study we focus on a very simple frequency distribution, taking all frequencies equal except a single one, that of a node we call the pacemaker. We analyze different dynamical regimens, studying systems at the transition point and in the incoherent state, both slightly above the critical point and far from it. The topological information we may catch are different under different conditions and sometimes complementary, ranging from local feature like the single node connectivity, to the hierarchical structure of functional clusters, and even to the entire adjacency matrix.

010       On the effect of the path length and transitivity of small-world   networks on epidemic dynamics
021       We show how one can trace in a systematic way the coarse-grained solutions of individual-based stochastic epidemic models evolving on heterogeneous complex networks with respect to their topological characteristics. 
020       In particular, we have developed algorithms that allow the tuning of the transitivity (clustering coefficient) and the average mean-path length allowing the investigation of the "pure" impacts of the two characteristics on the emergent behavior of detailed epidemic models. The framework could be used to shed more light into the influence of weak and strong social ties on epidemic spread within small-world network structures, and ultimately to provide novel systematic computational modeling and exploration of better contagion control strategies.

010       Characterizing interstellar filaments with Herschel in IC5146
021       We provide a first look at the results of the Herschel Gould Belt survey toward the IC5146 molecular cloud and present a preliminary analysis of the filamentary structure in this region. 
020       The column density map, derived from our 70-500 micron Herschel data, reveals a complex network of filaments, and confirms that these filaments are the main birth sites of prestellar cores. We analyze the column density profiles of 27 filaments and show that the underlying radial density profiles fall off as r^{-1.5} to r^{-2.5} at large radii. Our main result is that the filaments seem to be characterized by a narrow distribution of widths having a median value of 0.10 +- 0.03 pc, which is in stark contrast to a much broader distribution of central Jeans lengths. This characteristic width of ~0.1 pc corresponds to within a factor of ~2 to the sonic scale below which interstellar turbulence becomes subsonic in diffuse gas, supporting the argument that the filaments may form as a result of the dissipation of large-scale turbulence.

010       Impact of Single Links in Competitive Percolation -- How complex   networks grow under competition
021       How a complex network is connected crucially impacts its dynamics and function. 
020       Percolation, the transition to extensive connectedness upon gradual addition of links, was long believed to be continuous but recent numerical evidence on "explosive percolation" suggests that it might as well be discontinuous if links compete for addition. Here we analyze the microscopic mechanisms underlying discontinuous percolation processes and reveal a strong impact of single link additions. We show that in generic competitive percolation processes, including those displaying explosive percolation, single links do not induce a discontinuous gap in the largest cluster size in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, our results highlight that for large finite systems single links may still induce observable gaps because gap sizes scale weakly algebraically with system size. Several essentially macroscopic clusters coexist immediately before the transition, thus announcing discontinuous percolation. These results explain how single links may drastically change macroscopic connectivity in networks where links add competitively.

020       This mapping addresses the dynamical behavior of the fitness model within the framework of nonextensive statistics mechanics, which is characterized by a dimensionless nonextensivity parameter $q$. It is found that this new phenomenological parameter plays an important role in the evolution of networks: the underlying evolving networks may undergo a different phases depending on the $q$ exponents, comparing to the original B-B fitness model, and the corresponding critical transition "temperature" is identified.

010       Fluid flow analysis in a rough fracture (type II) using complex networks   and lattice Boltzmann method
021       Complexity of fluid flow in a rough fracture is induced by the complex configurations of opening areas between the fracture planes. 
020       In this study, we model fluid flow in an evolvable real rock joint structure, which under certain normal load is sheared. In an experimental study, information regarding about apertures of the rock joint during consecutive 20 mm displacements and fluid flow (permeability) in different pressure heads have been recorded by a scanner laser. Our aim in this study is to simulate the fluid flow in the mentioned complex geometries using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), while the characteristics of the aperture field will be compared with the modeled fluid flow permeability To characterize the aperture, we use a new concept in the graph theory, namely: complex networks and motif analysis of the corresponding networks. In this approach, the similar aperture profile along the fluid flow direction is mapped in to a network space. The modeled permeability using the LBM shows good correlation with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, the two main characters of the obtained networks, i.e., characteristic length and number of edges show the same evolutionary trend with the modeled permeability values. Analysis of motifs through the obtained networks showed the most transient sub-graphs are much more frequent in residual stages. This coincides with nearly stable fluid flow and high permeability values.

021       Terrorist attacks on transportation networks have traumatized modern societies. 
020       With a single blast, it has become possible to paralyze airline traffic, electric power supply, ground transportation or Internet communication. How and at which cost can one restructure the network such that it will become more robust against a malicious attack? We introduce a unique measure for robustness and use it to devise a method to mitigate economically and efficiently this risk. We demonstrate its efficiency on the European electricity system and on the Internet as well as on complex networks models. We show that with small changes in the network structure (low cost) the robustness of diverse networks can be improved dramatically while their functionality remains unchanged. Our results are useful not only for improving significantly with low cost the robustness of existing infrastructures but also for designing economically robust network systems.

010       Emergence of double scaling law in complex system
021       We introduce a stochastic model to explain a double power-law distribution which exhibits two different Paretian behaviors in the upper and the lower tail and widely exists in social and economic systems. 
020       The model incorporates fitness consideration and noise fluctuation. We find that if the number of variables (e.g. the degree of nodes in complex networks or people's incomes) grows exponentially, normal distributed fitness coupled with exponentially increasing variable is responsible for the emergence of the double power-law distribution. Fluctuations do not change the result qualitatively but contribute to the second-part scaling exponent. The evolution of Chinese airline network is taken as an example to show a nice agreement with our stochastic model.

010       Unfolding communities in large complex networks: Combining defensive and   offensive label propagation for core extraction
021       Label propagation has proven to be a fast method for detecting communities in large complex networks. 
020       Recent developments have also improved the accuracy of the approach, however, a general algorithm is still an open issue. We present an advanced label propagation algorithm that combines two unique strategies of community formation, namely, defensive preservation and offensive expansion of communities. Two strategies are combined in a hierarchical manner, to recursively extract the core of the network, and to identify whisker communities. The algorithm was evaluated on two classes of benchmark networks with planted partition and on almost 25 real-world networks ranging from networks with tens of nodes to networks with several tens of millions of edges. It is shown to be comparable to the current state-of-the-art community detection algorithms and superior to all previous label propagation algorithms, with comparable time complexity. In particular, analysis on real-world networks has proven that the algorithm has almost linear complexity, $\mathcal{O}(m^{1.19})$, and scales even better than basic label propagation algorithm ($m$ is the number of edges in the network).

We propose different label propagation algorithms that convey two unique strategies of community formation, namely, defensive preservation and offensive expansion of communities. Furthermore, the strategies are combined in an advanced label propagation algorithm that retains the advantages of both approaches; and are enhanced with hierarchical community extraction, prominent for the use on larger networks. The proposed algorithms were empirically evaluated on different benchmarks networks with planted partition and on over 30 real-world networks of various types and sizes. The results confirm the adequacy of the propositions and give promising grounds for future analysis of (large) complex networks. Nevertheless, the main contribution of this work is in showing that different types of networks (with different topological properties) favor different strategies of community formation.

010       Connectivity Damage to a Graph by the Removal of an Edge or a Vertex
021       The approach of quantifying the damage inflicted on a graph in Albert, Jeong and Barabsi's (AJB) report "Error and Attack Tolerance of Complex Networks" using the size of the largest connected component and the average size of the remaining components does not capture our intuitive idea of the damage to a graph caused by disconnections. 
020       We evaluate an alternative metric based on average inverse path lengths (AIPLs) that better fits our intuition that a graph can still be reasonably functional even when it is disconnected. We compare our metric with AJB's using a test set of graphs and report the differences. AJB's report should not be confused with a report by Crucitti et al. with the same name. Based on our analysis of graphs of different sizes and types, and using various numerical and statistical tools; the ratio of the average inverse path lengths of a connected graph of the same size as the sum of the size of the fragments of the disconnected graph can be used as a metric about the damage of a graph by the removal of an edge or a node. This damage is reported in the range (0,1) where 0 means that the removal had no effect on the graph's capability to perform its functions. A 1 means that the graph is totally dysfunctional. We exercise our metric on a collection of sample graphs that have been subjected to various attack profiles that focus on edge, node or degree betweenness values. We believe that this metric can be used to quantify the damage done to the graph by an attacker, and that it can be used in evaluating the positive effect of adding additional edges to an existing graph.

010       Condensation phase transition in nonlinear fitness networks
021       We analyze the condensation phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium complex networks in a unifying framework which includes the nonlinear model and the fitness model as its appropriate limits. 
020       We show a novel phase structure which depends on both the fitness parameter and the nonlinear exponent. The occurrence of the condensation phase transitions in the dynamical evolution of the network is demonstrated by using Bianconi-Barabasi method. We find that the nonlinear and the fitness preferential attachment mechanisms play important roles in formation of an interesting phase structure.

010       Transient Stability Assessment of Smart Power System using Complex   Networks Framework
021       In this paper, a new methodology for stability assessment of a smart power system is proposed. 
020       The key to this assessment is an index called betweenness index which is based on ideas from complex network theory. The proposed betweenness index is an improvement of previous works since it considers the actual real power flow through the transmission lines along the network. Furthermore, this work initiates a new area for complex system research to assess the stability of the power system.

010       A New Localized Network Based Routing Model in Computer and   Communication networks
021       In view of the fact that routing algorithms are network layer entities and the varying performance of any routing algorithm depends on the underlying networks. 
020       Localized routing algorithms avoid the problems associated with the maintenance of global network state by using statistics of flow blocking probabilities. We developed a new network parameter that can be used to predict which network topology gives better performance on the quality of localized QoS routing algorithms. Using this parameter we explore a simple model that can be rewired to introduce increasing the performance. We find that this model have small characteristic path length. Simulations of random and complex networks used to show that the performance is significantly affected by the level of connectivity.

021       Community detection is one of the most investigated problems in the field of complex networks. 
020       Although several methods were proposed, a precise definition of communities is still lacking. As a step towards a definition, I highlight two necessary properties of communities, separation and internal cohesion, the latter being a new concept. I propose a local method of community detection based on two-dimensional local optimization, which I tested on common benchmarks and on the word association database.

010       Link Prediction in Complex Networks: A Clustering Perspective
021       Link prediction is an open problem in the complex network, which attracts much research interest currently. 
020       However, little attention has been paid to the relation between network structure and the performance of prediction methods. In order to fill this vital gap, we try to understand how the network structure affects the performance of link prediction methods in the view of clustering. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks show that as the clustering grows, the precision of these methods could be improved remarkably, while for the sparse and weakly clustered network, they perform poorly. We explain this through the distinguishment caused by increased clustering between the score distribution of positive and negative instances. Our finding also sheds light on the problem of how to select appropriate approaches for different networks with various densities and clusterings.

010       Formation of Modularity in a Model of Evolving Networks
021       Modularity structures are common in various social and biological networks. 
020       However, its dynamical origin remains an open question. In this work, we set up a toy dynamical model describing the evolution of a social network. Based on the observations of real social networks, we introduced a strategy of link-creating/deleting according to the local dynamics in the model. Thus the coevolution of the dynamics and topology naturally determines the network properties. It is found that for a small coupling strength, the networked system cannot reach any synchronization and the network topology is homogeneous. Interestingly, when the coupling strength is large enough, the networked system spontaneously forms communities with different dynamical states. Meanwhile, the network topology becomes heterogeneous with modular structures. It is further shown that in certain parameter regime, both the degree and the community size in the formed network follow power-law distribution. These results are consistent with the characteristics of many empirical networks, and are helpful to understand the mechanism of formation of modularity in complex networks.

010       Weight-conserving characterization of complex functional brain networks
021       Complex functional brain networks are large networks of brain regions and functional brain connections. 
020       Statistical characterizations of these networks aim to quantify global and local properties of brain activity with a small number of network measures. Important functional network measures include measures of modularity (measures of the goodness with which a network is optimally partitioned into functional subgroups) and measures of centrality (measures of the functional influence of individual brain regions). Characterizations of functional networks are increasing in popularity, but are associated with several important methodological problems. These problems include the inability to characterize densely connected and weighted functional networks, the neglect of degenerate topologically distinct high-modularity partitions of these networks, and the absence of a network null model for testing hypotheses of association between observed nontrivial network properties and simple weighted connectivity properties. In this study we describe a set of methods to overcome these problems. Specifically, we generalize measures of modularity and centrality to fully connected and weighted complex networks, describe the detection of degenerate high-modularity partitions of these networks, and introduce a weighted-connectivity null model of these networks. We illustrate our methods by demonstrating degenerate high-modularity partitions and strong correlations between two complementary measures of centrality in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) networks from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, an open-access repository of resting-state functional MRI datasets. Our methods may allow more sound and reliable characterizations and comparisons of functional brain networks across conditions and subjects.

010       Analysis of Equilibria and Strategic Interaction in Complex Networks
021       This paper studies $n$-person simultaneous-move games with linear best response function, where individuals interact within a given network structure. 
020       This class of games have been used to model various settings, such as, public goods, belief formation, peer effects, and oligopoly. The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the network structure on Nash equilibrium outcomes of this class of games. Bramoull\'{e} et al. derived conditions for uniqueness and stability of a Nash equilibrium in terms of the smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix representing the network of interactions. Motivated by this result, we study how local structural properties of the network of interactions affect this eigenvalue, influencing game equilibria. In particular, we use algebraic graph theory and convex optimization to derive new bounds on the smallest eigenvalue in terms of the distribution of degrees, cycles, and other relevant substructures. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations involving online social networks.

010       Role-similarity based comparison of directed networks
021       The widespread relevance of complex networks is a valuable tool in the analysis of a broad range of systems. 
020       There is a demand for tools which enable the extraction of meaningful information and allow the comparison between different systems. We present a novel measure of similarity between nodes in different networks as a generalization of the concept of self-similarity. A similarity matrix is assembled as the distance between feature vectors that contain the in and out paths of all lengths for each node. Hence, nodes operating in a similar flow environment are considered similar regardless of network membership. We demonstrate that this method has the potential to be influential in tasks such as assigning identity or function to uncharacterized nodes. In addition an innovative application of graph partitioning to the raw results extends the concept to the comparison of networks in terms of their underlying role-structure.

010       Detecting the optimal number of communities in complex networks
021       To obtain the optimal number of communities is an important problem in detecting community structure. 
020       In this paper, we extend the measurement of community detecting algorithms to find the optimal community number. Based on the normalized mutual information index, which has been used as a measure for similarity of communities, a statistic $\Omega(c)$ is proposed to detect the optimal number of communities. In general, when $\Omega(c)$ reaches its local maximum, especially the first one, the corresponding number of communities \emph{c} is likely to be optimal in community detection. Moreover, the statistic $\Omega(c)$ can also measure the significance of community structures in complex networks, which has been paid more attention recently. Numerical and empirical results show that the index $\Omega(c)$ is effective in both artificial and real world networks.

010       Bipartite quantum states and random complex networks
021       We introduce a mapping between graphs and pure quantum bipartite states and show that the associated entanglement entropy conveys non-trivial information about the structure of the graph. 
020       Our primary goal is to investigate the family of random graphs known as complex networks. In the case of classical random graphs we derive an analytic expression for the averaged entanglement entropy $\bar S$ while for general complex networks we rely on numerics. For large number of nodes $n$ we find a scaling $\bar{S} \sim c \log n +g_e$ where both the prefactor $c$ and the sub-leading O(1) term $g_e$ are a characteristic of the different classes of complex networks. In particular, $g_e$ encodes topological features of the graphs and is named network topological entropy. Our results suggest that quantum entanglement may provide a powerful tool in the analysis of large complex networks with non-trivial topological properties.

010       Information content of colored motifs in complex networks
021       We study complex networks in which the nodes of the network are tagged with different colors depending on the functionality of the nodes (colored graphs), using information theory applied to the distribution of motifs in such networks. 
020       We find that colored motifs can be viewed as the building blocks of the networks (much more so than the uncolored structural motifs can be) and that the relative frequency with which these motifs appear in the network can be used to define the information content of the network. This information is defined in such a way that a network with random coloration (but keeping the relative number of nodes with different colors the same) has zero color information content. Thus, colored motif information captures the exceptionality of coloring in the motifs that is maintained via selection. We study the motif information content of the C. elegans brain as well as the evolution of colored motif information in networks that reflect the interaction between instructions in genomes of digital life organisms. While we find that colored motif information appears to capture essential functionality in the C. elegans brain (where the color assignment of nodes is straightforward) it is not obvious whether the colored motif information content always increases during evolution, as would be expected from a measure that captures network complexity. For a single choice of color assignment of instructions in the digital life form Avida, we find rather that colored motif information content increases or decreases during evolution, depending on how the genomes are organized, and therefore could be an interesting tool to dissect genomic rearrangements.

010       Complex network analysis of water distribution systems
021       This paper explores a variety of strategies for understanding the formation, structure, efficiency and vulnerability of water distribution networks. 
020       Water supply systems are studied as spatially organized networks for which the practical applications of abstract evaluation methods are critically evaluated. Empirical data from benchmark networks are used to study the interplay between network structure and operational efficiency, reliability and robustness. Structural measurements are undertaken to quantify properties such as redundancy and optimal-connectivity, herein proposed as constraints in network design optimization problems. The role of the supply-demand structure towards system efficiency is studied and an assessment of the vulnerability to failures based on the disconnection of nodes from the source(s) is undertaken. The absence of conventional degree-based hubs (observed through uncorrelated non-heterogeneous sparse topologies) prompts an alternative approach to studying structural vulnerability based on the identification of network cut-sets and optimal connectivity invariants. A discussion on the scope, limitations and possible future directions of this research is provided.

010       Coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations of the phase transition of Potts   model on weighted networks
021       Developing effective coarse grained (CG) approach is a promising way for studying dynamics on large size networks. 
020       In the present work, we have proposed a strength-based CG (\sCG) method to study critical phenomena of the Potts model on weighted complex networks. By merging nodes with close strength together, the original network is reduced to a CG-network with much smaller size, on which the CG-Hamiltonian can be well-defined. In particular, we make error analysis and show that our strength-based CG approach satisfies the condition of statistical consistency, which demands that the equilibrium probability distribution of the CG-model matches that of the microscopic counterpart. Extensive numerical simulations are performed on scale-free networks, without or with strength-correlation, showing that this \sCG approach works very well in reproducing the phase diagrams, fluctuations, and finite size effects of the microscopic model, while the \dCG approach proposed in our recent work [Phys. Rev. E 82, 011107(2010)] does not.

We analyze here epidemic spreading on directed complex networks, but similar results are also valid for undirected ones.

010       Voter Model with Time dependent Flip-rates
021       We introduce time variation in the flip-rates of the Voter Model. 
020       This type of generalisation is relevant to models of ageing in language change, allowing the representation of changes in speakers' learning rates over their lifetime and may be applied to any other similar model in which interaction rates at the microscopic level change with time. The mean time taken to reach consensus varies in a nontrivial way with the rate of change of the flip-rates, varying between bounds given by the mean consensus times for static homogeneous (the original Voter Model) and static heterogeneous flip-rates. By considering the mean time between interactions for each agent, we derive excellent estimates of the mean consensus times and exit probabilities for any time scale of flip-rate variation. The scaling of consensus times with population size on complex networks is correctly predicted, and is as would be expected for the ordinary voter model. Heterogeneity in the initial distribution of opinions has a strong effect, considerably reducing the mean time to consensus, while increasing the probability of survival of the opinion which initially occupies the most slowly changing agents. The mean times to reach consensus for different states are very different. An opinion originally held by the fastest changing agents has a smaller chance to succeed, and takes much longer to do so than an evenly distributed opinion.

010       Internal links and pairs as a new tool for the analysis of bipartite   complex networks
021       Many real-world complex networks are best modeled as bipartite (or 2-mode) graphs, where nodes are divided into two sets with links connecting one side to the other. 
020       However, there is currently a lack of methods to analyze properly such graphs as most existing measures and methods are suited to classical graphs. A usual but limited approach consists in deriving 1-mode graphs (called projections) from the underlying bipartite structure, though it causes important loss of information and data storage issues. We introduce here internal links and pairs as a new notion useful for such analysis: it gives insights on the information lost by projecting the bipartite graph. We illustrate the relevance of theses concepts on several real-world instances illustrating how it enables to discriminate behaviors among various cases when we compare them to a benchmark of random networks. Then, we show that we can draw benefit from this concept for both modeling complex networks and storing them in a compact format.

010       Diseases spreading through individual based models with realistic   mobility patterns
021       The individual-based models constitute a set of widely implemented tools to analyze the incidence of individuals heterogeneities in the spread of an infectious disease. 
020       In this work we focus our attention on human contacts heterogeneities through two of the main individual-based models: mobile agents and complex networks models. We introduce a novel mobile agents model in which individuals make displacements with sizes according to a truncated power-law distribution based on empirical evidence about human mobility. Besides, we present a procedure to obtain an equivalent weighted contact network from the previous mobile agents model, where the weights of the links are interpreted as contact probabilities. From the topological analysis of the equivalent contact networks we show that small world characteristics are related with truncated power-law distribution for agent displacements. Finally, we show the equivalence between both approaches through some numerical experiments for the spread of an infectious disease.

010       Stripe-like quasi-nondiffracting optical lattices
021       We introduce stripe-like quasi-nondiffracting lattices that can be generated via spatial spectrum engineering. 
020       The complexity of the spatial shapes of such lattices and the distance of their almost diffractionless propagation depend on the width of their ring-like spatial spectrum. Stripe-like lattices are extended in one direction and are localized in the orthogonal one, thereby creating either straight or curved in any desired fashion optically-induced channels that may be used for optical trapping, optical manipulation, or optical lattices for quantum and nonlinear optics applications. As an illustrative example, here we show their potential for spatial soliton control. Complex networks consisting of several intersecting or joining stripe-like lattices suited to a particular application may also be constructed.

010       Comparing the Topological and Electrical Structure of the North American   Electric Power Infrastructure
021       The topological (graph) structure of complex networks often provides valuable information about the performance and vulnerability of the network. 
020       However, there are multiple ways to represent a given network as a graph. Electric power transmission and distribution networks have a topological structure that is straightforward to represent and analyze as a graph. However, simple graph models neglect the comprehensive connections between components that result from Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. This paper describes the structure of the three North American electric power interconnections, from the perspective of both topological and electrical connectivity. We compare the simple topology of these networks with that of random (Erdos and Renyi, 1959), preferential-attachment (Barabasi and Albert, 1999) and small-world (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) networks of equivalent sizes and find that power grids differ substantially from these abstract models in degree distribution, clustering, diameter and assortativity, and thus conclude that these topological forms may be misleading as models of power systems. To study the electrical connectivity of power systems, we propose a new method for representing electrical structure using electrical distances rather than geographic connections. Comparisons of these two representations of the North American power networks reveal notable differences between the electrical and topological structure of electric power networks.

010       Robustness of Complex Networks against Attacks Guided by Damage
021       Extensive researches have been dedicated to investigating the performance of real networks and synthetic networks against random failures or intentional attack guided by degree (degree attack). 
020       Degree is one of straightforward measures to characterize the vitality of a vertex in maintaining the integrity of the network but not the only one. Damage, the decrease of the largest component size that was caused by the removal of a vertex, intuitively is a more destructive guide for intentional attack on networks since the network functionality is usually measured by the largest component size. However, it is surprising to find that little is known about behaviors of real networks or synthetic networks against intentional attack guided by damage (damage attack), in which adversaries always choose the vertex with the largest damage to attack. <br />In this article, we dedicate our efforts to understanding damage attack and behaviors of real networks as well as synthetic networks against this attack. To this end, existing attacking models, statistical properties of damage in complex networks are first revisited. Then, we present the empirical analysis results about behaviors of complex networks against damage attack with the comparisons to degree attack. It is surprising to find a cross-point for diverse networks before which damage attack is more destructive than degree attack. Further investigation shows that the existence of cross-point can be attributed to the fact that: degree attack tends produce networks with more heterogenous damage distribution than damage attack. Results in this article strongly suggest that damage attack is one of most destructive attacks and deserves our research efforts.Our understandings about damage attack may also shed light on efficient solutions to protect real networks against damage attack.

021       The "clumpiness" matrix of a network is used to develop a method to identify its community structure. 
020       A "projection space" is constructed from the eigenvectors of the clumpiness matrix and a border line is defined using some kind of angular distance in this space. The community structure of the network is identified using this borderline and/or hierarchical clustering methods. The performance of our algorithm is tested on some computer-generated and real-world networks. The accuracy of the results is checked using normalized mutual information. The effect of community size heterogeneity on the accuracy of the method is also discussed.

010       On the Degree Distribution of Faulty Peer-to-Peer Overlays
021       This paper presents an analytical framework to model fault-tolerance in unstructured peer-to-peer overlays, represented as complex networks. 
020       We define a distributed protocol peers execute for managing the overlay and reacting to node faults. Based on the protocol, evolution equations are defined and manipulated by resorting to generating functions. Obtained outcomes provide insights on the nodes' degree probability distribution. From the study of the degree distribution, it is possible to estimate other important metrics of the peer-to-peer overlay, such as the diameter of the network. We study different networks, characterized by three specific desired degree distributions, i.e. nets with nodes having a fixed desired degree, random graphs and scale-free networks. All these networks are assessed via the analytical tool and simulation as well. Results show that the approach can be factually employed to dynamically tune the average attachment rate at peers so that they maintain their own desired degree and, in general, the desired network topology.

010       Farey Graphs as Models for Complex Networks
021       Farey sequences of irreducible fractions between 0 and 1 can be related to graph constructions known as Farey graphs. 
020       These graphs were first introduced by Matula and Kornerup in 1979 and further studied by Colbourn in 1982 and they have many interesting properties: they are minimally 3-colorable, uniquely Hamiltonian, maximally outerplanar and perfect. In this paper we introduce a simple generation method for a Farey graph family, and we study analytically relevant topological properties: order, size, degree distribution and correlation, clustering, transitivity, diameter and average distance. We show that the graphs are a good model for networks associated with some complex systems.

010       An Empirical Investigation on Important Subgraphs in   Cooperation-Competition networks
021       Subgraphs are very important for understanding structure and function of complex networks. 
020       Dyad and triad are the elementary subgraphs. We focus on the distribution of their act degree defined as the number of activities, events or organizations they join, which indicates the importance of the subgraphs. The empirical studies show that, in a lot of real world systems, the dyad or triad act degree distributions follow "shifted power law" (SPL), where {\alpha} and {\gamma} are constants. We defined a "heterogeneity index", H, to describe how it is uneven and analytically deduced the correlation between H and {\alpha} and {\gamma}. This manuscript, which shows the details of the empirical studies, serves as an online supplement of a paper submitted to a journal.

010       LUNES: Agent-based Simulation of P2P Systems (Extended Version)
021       We present LUNES, an agent-based Large Unstructured NEtwork Simulator, which allows to simulate complex networks composed of a high number of nodes. 
020       LUNES is modular, since it splits the three phases of network topology creation, protocol simulation and performance evaluation. This permits to easily integrate external software tools into the main software architecture. The simulation of the interaction protocols among network nodes is performed via a simulation middleware that supports both the sequential and the parallel/distributed simulation approaches. In the latter case, a specific mechanism for the communication overhead-reduction is used; this guarantees high levels of performance and scalability. To demonstrate the efficiency of LUNES, we test the simulator with gossip protocols executed on top of networks (representing peer-to-peer overlays), generated with different topologies. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

010       Deciphering Network Community Structure by Surprise
021       The analysis of complex networks permeates all sciences, from biology to sociology. 
020       A fundamental, unsolved problem is how to characterize the community structure of a network. Here, using both standard and novel benchmarks, we show that maximization of a simple global parameter, which we call Surprise (S), leads to a very efficient characterization of the community structure of complex synthetic networks. Particularly, S qualitatively outperforms the most commonly used criterion to define communities, Newman and Girvan's modularity (Q). Applying S maximization to real networks often provides natural, well-supported partitions, but also sometimes counterintuitive solutions that expose the limitations of our previous knowledge. These results indicate that it is possible to define an effective global criterion for community structure and open new routes for the understanding of complex networks.

020       We construct a directed network using a suitable definition of tactical moves including local patterns, and study this network for different datasets of professional tournaments and amateur games. The move distribution follows Zipf's law and the network is scale free, with statistical peculiarities different from other real directed networks, such as e. g. the World Wide Web. These specificities reflect in the outcome of ranking algorithms applied to it. The fine study of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices used by the ranking algorithms singles out certain strategic situations. Our results should pave the way to a better modelization of board games and other types of human strategic scheming.

021       In this paper we investigate networks whose evolution is governed by the interaction of a random assembly process and an optimization process. 
020       In the first process, new nodes are added one at a time and form connections to randomly selected old nodes. In between node additions, the network is rewired to minimize its pathlength. For timescales, at which neither the assembly nor the optimization processes are dominant, we find a rich variety of complex networks with power law tails in the degree distributions. These networks also exhibit non-trivial clustering, a hierarchical organization and interesting degree mixing patterns.

010       The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on networks
021       We study the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on complex networks, as a paradigmatic model for transport subject to excluded volume interactions. 
020       Building on TASEP phenomenology on a single segment and borrowing ideas from random networks we investigate the effect of connectivity on transport. In particular, we argue that the presence of disorder in the topology of vertices crucially modifies the transport features of a network: irregular networks involve homogeneous segments and have a bimodal distribution of edge densities, whereas regular networks are dominated by shocks leading to a unimodal density distribution. The proposed numerical approach of solving for mean-field transport on networks provides a general framework for studying TASEP on large networks, and is expected to generalize to other transport processes.

010       Competing epidemics on complex networks
021       Human diseases spread over networks of contacts between individuals and a substantial body of recent research has focused on the dynamics of the spreading process. 
020       Here we examine a model of two competing diseases spreading over the same network at the same time, where infection with either disease gives an individual subsequent immunity to both. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we derive the phase diagram of the system and estimates of the expected final numbers of individuals infected with each disease. The system shows an unusual dynamical transition between dominance of one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of growth. Close to this transition the final outcomes show strong dependence on stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals. In most regions of the phase diagram we find that one disease eventually dominates while the other reaches only a vanishing fraction of the network, but the system also displays a significant coexistence regime in which both diseases reach epidemic proportions and infect an extensive fraction of the network.

010       Robustness and Assortativity for Diffusion-like Processes in Scale-free   Networks
021       By analysing the diffusive dynamics of epidemics and of distress in complex networks, we study the effect of the assortativity on the robustness of the networks. 
020       We first determine by spectral analysis the thresholds above which epidemics/failures can spread; we then calculate the slowest diffusional times. Our results shows that disassortative networks exhibit a higher epidemiological threshold and are therefore easier to immunize, while in assortative networks there is a longer time for intervention before epidemic/failure spreads. Moreover, we study by computer simulations the sandpile cascade model, a diffusive model of distress propagation (financial contagion). We show that, while assortative networks are more prone to the propagation of epidemic/failures, degree-targeted immunization policies increases their resilience to systemic risk.

010       Controlling Complex Networks with Compensatory Perturbations
021       The response of complex networks to perturbations is of utmost importance in areas as diverse as ecosystem management, emergency response, and cell reprogramming. 
020       A fundamental property of networks is that the perturbation of one node can affect other nodes, in a process that may cause the entire or substantial part of the system to change behavior and possibly collapse. Recent research in metabolic and food-web networks has demonstrated the concept that network damage caused by external perturbations can often be mitigated or reversed by the application of compensatory perturbations. Compensatory perturbations are constrained to be physically admissible and amenable to implementation on the network. However, the systematic identification of compensatory perturbations that conform to these constraints remains an open problem. Here, we present a method to construct compensatory perturbations that can control the fate of general networks under such constraints. Our approach accounts for the full nonlinear behavior of real complex networks and can bring the system to a desirable target state even when this state is not directly accessible. Applications to genetic networks show that compensatory perturbations are effective even when limited to a small fraction of all nodes in the network and that they are far more effective when limited to the highest-degree nodes. The approach is conceptually simple and computationally efficient, making it suitable for the rescue, control, and reprogramming of large complex networks in various domains.

010       Link prediction in complex networks: a local na\&quot;{\i}ve Bayes model
021       Common-neighbor-based method is simple yet effective to predict missing links, which assume that two nodes are more likely to be connected if they have more common neighbors. 
020       In such method, each common neighbor of two nodes contributes equally to the connection likelihood. In this Letter, we argue that different common neighbors may play different roles and thus lead to different contributions, and propose a local na\"{\i}ve Bayes model accordingly. Extensive experiments were carried out on eight real networks. Compared with the common-neighbor-based methods, the present method can provide more accurate predictions. Finally, we gave a detailed case study on the US air transportation network.

010       Community structure of complex software systems: Analysis and   applications
021       Due to notable discoveries in the fast evolving field of complex networks, recent research in software engineering has also focused on representing software systems with networks. 
020       Previous work has observed that these networks follow scale-free degree distributions and reveal small-world phenomena, while we here explore another property commonly found in different complex networks, i.e. community structure. We adopt class dependency networks, where nodes represent software classes and edges represent dependencies among them, and show that these networks reveal a significant community structure, characterized by similar properties as observed in other complex networks. However, although intuitive and anticipated by different phenomena, identified communities do not exactly correspond to software packages. We empirically confirm our observations on several networks constructed from Java and various third party libraries, and propose different applications of community detection to software engineering.

010       Misleading Stars: What Cannot Be Measured in the Internet?
021       Traceroute measurements are one of our main instruments to shed light onto the structure and properties of today's complex networks such as the Internet. 
020       This paper studies the feasibility and infeasibility of inferring the network topology given traceroute data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any probabilistic assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend to a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose two fundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the traceroute data: (1) each trace corresponds to a real path in the network, and (2) the routing paths are at most a factor 1/alpha off the shortest paths, for some parameter alpha in (0,1]. In contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of the set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that a large number of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic, as long as the networks have a similar structure. We hence seek to characterize the set of topologies inferred with our axioms. We introduce the notion of star graphs whose colorings capture the differences among inferred topologies; it also allows us to construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general, inferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important aspects, such as the nodes' distances or the number of triangles. These negative results are complemented by a discussion of a scenario where the trace set is best possible, i.e., "complete". It turns out that while some properties such as the node degrees are still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to determine global properties such as the connectivity.

010       Propagation of non-classical correlations across a quantum spin chain
021       We study the transport of quantum correlations across a chain of interacting spin-1/2 particles. 
020       As a quantitative figure of merit, we choose a symmetric version of quantum discord and compare it with the transported entanglement, addressing various operating regimes of the spin medium. Discord turns out to be better transported for a wide range of working points and initial conditions of the system. We relate this behavior to the efficiency of propagation of a single excitation across the spin chain. Moreover, we point out the role played by a magnetic field in the dynamics of discord in the effective channel embodied by the chain. Our analysis can be interestingly extended to transport processes in more complex networks and the study of non-classical correlations under general quantum channels.

010       Structural preferential attachment: Network organization beyond the link
021       We introduce a mechanism which models the emergence of the universal properties of complex networks, such as scale independence, modularity and self-similarity, and unifies them under a scale-free organization beyond the link. 
020       This brings a new perspective on network organization where communities, instead of links, are the fundamental building blocks of complex systems. We show how our simple model can reproduce social and information networks by predicting their community structure and more importantly, how their nodes or communities are interconnected, often in a self-similar manner.

010       Assessing the consistency of community structure in complex networks
021       In recent years, community structure has emerged as a key component of complex network analysis. 
020       As more data has been collected, researchers have begun investigating changing community structure across multiple networks. Several methods exist to analyze changing communities, but most of these are limited to evolution of a single network over time. In addition, most of the existing methods are more concerned with change at the community level than at the level of the individual node. In this paper, we introduce scaled inclusivity, which is a method to quantify the change in community structure across networks. Scaled inclusivity evaluates the consistency of the classiffication of every node in a network independently. In addition, the method can be applied cross-sectionally as well as longitudinally. In this paper, we calculate the scaled inclusivity for a set of simulated networks of United States cities and a set of real networks consisting of teams that play in the top division of American college football. We found that scaled inclusivity yields reasonable results for the consistency of individual nodes in both sets of networks. We propose that scaled inclusivity may provide a useful way to quantify the change in a network's community structure.

010       Hypergraphs and City Street Networks
021       The map of a city's streets constitutes a particular case of spatial complex network. 
020       However a city is not limited to its topology: it is above all a geometrical object whose particularity is to organize into short and long axes called streets. In this article we present and discuss two algorithms aiming at recovering the notion of street from a graph representation of a city. Then we show that the length of the so-called streets scales logarithmically. This phenomenon leads to assume that a city is shaped into a logic of extension and division of space.

020       The visitor flow pattern of Expo is investigated in this paper. The Hurst exponent, mean value and standard deviation of visitor volume prove that the visitor flow is fractal with long-term stability and correlation as well as obvious fluctuation in short period. Then the time series of visitor volume is converted to complex network by visibility algorithm. It can be inferred from the topological properties of the visibility graph that the network is scale-free, small-world and hierarchically constructed, conforming that the time series are fractal and close relationship exit between the visitor volume on different days. Furthermore, it is inevitable to show some extreme visitor volume in the original visitor flow, and these extreme points may appear in group to a great extent.

020       A new analytical formalism has been recently proposed to deal with heterogeneous k-cores, where each vertex is assigned a local threshold k_i. In this paper we identify a binary mixture of heterogeneous k-core which exhibits a tricritical point.

010       Modular networks of word correlations on Twitter
021       Complex networks are important tools for analyzing the information flow in many aspects of nature and human society. 
020       Using data from the microblogging service Twitter, we study networks of correlations in the appearance of words from three different categories, international brands, nouns and US major cities. We create networks where the strength of links is determined by a similarity measure based on the rate of coappearance of words. In comparison with the null model, where words are assumed to be uncorrelated, the heavy-tailed distribution of pair correlations is shown to be a consequence of modules of words representing similar entities.

010       Components in time-varying graphs
021       Real complex systems are inherently time-varying. 
020       Thanks to new communication systems and novel technologies, it is today possible to produce and analyze social and biological networks with detailed information on the time of occurrence and duration of each link. However, standard graph metrics introduced so far in complex network theory are mainly suited for static graphs, i.e., graphs in which the links do not change over time, or graphs built from time-varying systems by aggregating all the links as if they were concurrent in time. In this paper, we extend the notion of connectedness, and the definitions of node and graph components, to the case of time-varying graphs, which are represented as time-ordered sequences of graphs defined over a fixed set of nodes. We show that the problem of finding strongly connected components in a time-varying graph can be mapped into the problem of discovering the maximal-cliques in an opportunely constructed static graph, which we name the affine graph. It is therefore an NP-complete problem. As a practical example, we have performed a temporal component analysis of time-varying graphs constructed from three data sets of human interactions. The results show that taking time into account in the definition of graph components allows to capture important features of real systems. In particular, we observe a large variability in the size of node temporal in- and out-components. This is due to intrinsic fluctuations in the activity patterns of individuals, which cannot be detected by static graph analysis.

010       Nodal dynamics, not degree distributions, determine the structural   controllability of complex networks
021       Structural controllability has been proposed as an analytical framework for making predictions regarding the control of complex networks across myriad disciplines in the physical and life sciences (Liu et al., Nature:473(7346):167-173, 2011). 
020       Although the integration of control theory and network analysis is important, we argue that the application of the structural controllability framework to most if not all real-world networks leads to the conclusion that a single control input, applied to the power dominating set (PDS), is all that is needed for structural controllability. This result is consistent with the well-known fact that controllability and its dual observability are generic properties of systems. We argue that more important than issues of structural controllability are the questions of whether a system is almost uncontrollable, whether it is almost unobservable, and whether it possesses almost pole-zero cancellations.

010       Robustness of Optimal Synchronization in Real Networks
021       Experimental studies of synchronization properties on networks with controlled connection topology can provide powerful insights into the physics of complex networks. 
020       Here, we report experimental results on the influence of connection topology on synchronization in fiber-optic networks of chaotic optoelectronic oscillators. We find that the recently predicted non-monotonic, cusp-like synchronization landscape manifests itself in the rate of convergence to the synchronous state. We also observe that networks with the same number of nodes, same number of links, and identical eigenvalues of the coupling matrix can exhibit fundamentally different approaches to synchronization. This previously unnoticed difference is determined by the degeneracy of associated eigenvectors in the presence of noise and mismatches encountered in real-world conditions.

010       Heterogenous mean-field analysis of a generalized voter-like model on   networks
021       We propose a generalized framework for the study of voter models in complex networks at the the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) level that (i) yields a unified picture for existing copy/invasion processes and (ii) allows for the introduction of further heterogeneity through degree-selectivity rules. 
020       In the context of the HMF approximation, our model is capable of providing straightforward estimates for central quantities such as the exit probability and the consensus/fixation time, based on the statistical properties of the complex network alone. The HMF approach has the advantage of being readily applicable also in those cases in which exact solutions are difficult to work out. Finally, the unified formalism allows one to understand previously proposed voter-like processes as simple limits of the generalized model.

010       Speed of complex network synchronization
021       Synchrony is one of the most common dynamical states emerging on networks. 
020       The speed of convergence towards synchrony provides a fundamental collective time scale for synchronizing systems. Here we study the asymptotic synchronization times for directed networks with topologies ranging from completely ordered, grid-like, to completely disordered, random, including intermediate, partially disordered topologies. We extend the approach of Master Stability Functions to quantify synchronization times. We find that the synchronization times strongly and systematically depend on the network topology. In particular, at fixed in-degree, stronger topological randomness induces faster synchronization, whereas at fixed path length, synchronization is slowest for intermediate randomness in the small-world regime. Randomly rewiring real-world neural, social and transport networks confirms this picture.

010       Belief-propagation algorithm and the Ising model on networks with   arbitrary distributions of motifs
021       We generalize the belief-propagation algorithm to sparse random networks with arbitrary distributions of motifs (triangles, loops, etc.). 
020       Each vertex in these networks belongs to a given set of motifs (generalization of the configuration model). These networks can be treated as sparse uncorrelated hypergraphs in which hyperedges represent motifs. Here a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph, where a hyperedge can connect any number of vertices. These uncorrelated hypergraphs are tree-like (hypertrees), which crucially simplify the problem and allow us to apply the belief-propagation algorithm to these loopy networks with arbitrary motifs. As natural examples, we consider motifs in the form of finite loops and cliques. We apply the belief-propagation algorithm to the ferromagnetic Ising model on the resulting random networks. We obtain an exact solution of this model on networks with finite loops or cliques as motifs. We find an exact critical temperature of the ferromagnetic phase transition and demonstrate that with increasing the clustering coefficient and the loop size, the critical temperature increases compared to ordinary tree-like complex networks. Our solution also gives the birth point of the giant connected component in these loopy networks.

010       Optimizing and controlling functions of complex networks by manipulating   rich-club connections
021       Traditionally, there is no evidence suggesting that there are strong ties between the rich-club property and the function of complex networks. 
020       In this study, we find that whether a very small portion of rich nodes connected to each other or not can strongly affect the frequency of occurrence of basic building blocks (motif) within networks, and therefore the function, of a heterogeneous network. Conversely whether a homogeneous network has a rich-club property or not generally has no significant effect on its structure and function. These findings open the possibility to optimize and control the function of complex networks by manipulating rich-club connections. Furthermore, based on the subgraph ratio profile, we develop a more rigorous approach to judge whether a network has a rich-club or not. The new method does not calculate how many links there are among rich nodes but depends on how the links among rich nodes can affect the overall structure as well as function of a given network. These results can also help us to understand the evolution of dynamical networks and design new models for characterizing real-world networks.

010       Hybrid complex network topologies are preferred for   component-subscription in large-scale data-centres
021       We report on experiments exploring the interplay between the topology of the complex network of dependent components in a large-scale data-centre, and the robustness and scaling properties of that data-centre. 
020       In a previous paper [1] we used the SPECI large-scale data-centre simulator [2] to compare the robustness and scaling characteristics of data-centres whose dependent components are connected via Strogatz-Watts small-world (SW) networks [3], versus those organized as Barabasi-Albert scale-free (SF) networks [4], and found significant differences. In this paper, we present results from using the Klemm-Eguiliz (KE) construction method [5] to generate complex network topologies for data-centre component dependencies. The KE model has a control parameter {\mu}\in[0,1]\inR that determines whether the networks generated are SW (0&lt;{\mu}&lt;&lt;1) or SF ({\mu}=1) or a "hybrid" network topology part-way between SW and SF (0&lt;{\mu}&lt;1). We find that the best scores for system-level performance metrics of the simulated data-centres are given by "hybrid" values of {\mu} significantly different from pure-SW or pure-SF.

010       Robust network community detection using balanced propagation
021       Label propagation has proven to be an extremely fast method for detecting communities in large complex networks. 
020       Furthermore, due to its simplicity, it is also currently one of the most commonly adopted algorithms in the literature. Despite various subsequent advances, an important issue of the algorithm has not yet been properly addressed. Random (node) update orders within the algorithm severely hamper its robustness, and consequently also the stability of the identified community structure. We note that an update order can be seen as increasing propagation preferences from certain nodes, and propose a balanced propagation that counteracts for the introduced randomness by utilizing node balancers. We have evaluated the proposed approach on synthetic networks with planted partition, and on several real-world networks with community structure. The results confirm that balanced propagation is significantly more robust than label propagation, when the performance of community detection is even improved. Thus, balanced propagation retains high scalability and algorithmic simplicity of label propagation, but improves on its stability and performance.

010       Topological Fidelity in Sensor Networks
021       Sensor Networks are inherently complex networks, and many of their associated problems require analysis of some of their global characteristics. 
020       These are primarily affected by the topology of the network. We present in this paper, a general framework for a topological analysis of a network, and develop distributed algorithms in a generalized combinatorial setting in order to solve two seemingly unrelated problems, 1) Coverage hole detection and Localization and 2) Worm hole attack detection and Localization. We also note these solutions remain coordinate free as no priori localization information of the nodes is assumed. For the coverage hole problem, we follow a "divide and conquer approach", by strategically dissecting the network so that the overall topology is preserved, while efficiently pursuing the detection and localization of failures. The detection of holes, is enabled by first attributing a combinatorial object called a "Rips Complex" to each network segment, and by subsequently checking the existence/non-existence of holes by way of triviality of the first homology class of this complex. Our estimate exponentially approaches the location of potential holes with each iteration, yielding a very fast convergence coupled with optimal usage of valuable resources such as power and memory. We then show a simple extension of the above problem to address a well known problem in networks, namely the localization of a worm hole attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm with several substantiating examples.

010       Non-perturbative heterogeneous mean-field approach to epidemic spreading   in complex networks
021       Since roughly a decade ago, network science has focused among others on the problem of how the spreading of diseases depends on structural patterns. 
020       Here, we contribute to further advance our understanding of epidemic spreading processes by proposing a non-perturbative formulation of the heterogeneous mean field approach that has been commonly used in the physics literature to deal with this kind of spreading phenomena. The non-perturbative equations we propose have no assumption about the proximity of the system to the epidemic threshold, nor any linear approximation of the dynamics. In particular, we first develop a probabilistic description at the node level of the epidemic propagation for the so-called susceptible-infected-susceptible family of models, and after we derive the corresponding heterogeneous mean-field approach. We propose to use the full extension of the approach instead of pruning the expansion to first order, which leads to a non-perturbative formulation that can be solved by fixed point iteration, and used with reliability far away from the epidemic threshold to assess the prevalence of the epidemics. Our results are in close agreement with Monte Carlo simulations thus enhancing the predictive power of the classical heterogeneous mean field approach, while providing a more effective framework in terms of computational time.

010       Nanoscale phase separation in the iron chalcogenide superconductor   K0.8Fe1.6Se2 as seen via scanning nanofocused x-ray diffraction
021       Advanced synchrotron radiation focusing down to a size of 300 nm has been used to visualize nanoscale phase separation in the K0.8Fe1.6Se2 superconducting system using scanning nanofocus single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
020       The results show an intrinsic phase separation in K0.8Fe1.6Se2 single crystals at T&lt; 520 K, revealing coexistence of i) a magnetic phase characterized by an expanded lattice with superstructures due to Fe vacancy ordering and ii) a non-magnetic phase with an in-plane compressed lattice. The spatial distribution of the two phases at 300 K shows a frustrated or arrested nature of the phase separation. The space-resolved imaging of the phase separation permitted us to provide a direct evidence of nanophase domains smaller than 300 nm and different micrometer-sized regions with percolating magnetic or nonmagnetic domains forming a multiscale complex network of the two phases.

010       Corporate competition: A self-organized network
021       A substantial number of studies have extended the work on universal properties in physical systems to complex networks in social, biological, and technological systems. 
020       In this paper, we present a complex networks perspective on interfirm organizational networks by mapping, analyzing and modeling the spatial structure of a large interfirm competition network across a variety of sectors and industries within the United States. We propose two micro-dynamic models that are able to reproduce empirically observed characteristics of competition networks as a natural outcome of a minimal set of general mechanisms governing the formation of competition networks. Both models, which utilize different approaches yet apply common principles to network formation give comparable results. There is an asymmetry between companies that are considered competitors, and companies that consider others as their competitors. All companies only consider a small number of other companies as competitors; however, there are a few companies that are considered as competitors by many others. Geographically, the density of corporate headquarters strongly correlates with local population density, and the probability two firms are competitors declines with geographic distance. We construct these properties by growing a corporate network with competitive links using random incorporations modulated by population density and geographic distance. Our new analysis, methodology and empirical results are relevant to various phenomena of social and market behavior, and have implications to research fields such as economic geography, economic sociology, and regional economic development.

010       Geometry of Complex Networks and Topological Centrality
021       We explore the geometry of complex networks in terms of an n-dimensional Euclidean embedding represented by the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of the graph Laplacian $(\bb L^+)$. 
020       The squared distance of a node $i$ to the origin in this n-dimensional space $(l^+_{ii})$, yields a topological centrality index $(\mathcal{C}^{*}(i) = 1/l^+_{ii})$ for node $i$. In turn, the sum of reciprocals of individual node structural centralities, $\sum_{i}1/\mathcal{C}^*(i) = \sum_{i} l^+_{ii}$, i.e. the trace of $\bb L^+$, yields the well-known Kirchhoff index $(\mathcal{K})$, an overall structural descriptor for the network. In addition to this geometric interpretation, we provide alternative interpretations of the proposed indices to reveal their true topological characteristics: first, in terms of forced detour overheads and frequency of recurrences in random walks that has an interesting analogy to voltage distributions in the equivalent electrical network; and then as the average connectedness of $i$ in all the bi-partitions of the graph. These interpretations respectively help establish the topological centrality $(\mathcal{C}^{*}(i))$ of node $i$ as a measure of its overall position as well as its overall connectedness in the network; thus reflecting the robustness of node $i$ to random multiple edge failures. Through empirical evaluations using synthetic and real world networks, we demonstrate how the topological centrality is better able to distinguish nodes in terms of their structural roles in the network and, along with Kirchhoff index, is appropriately sensitive to perturbations/rewirings in the network.

010       Uncovering Evolutionary Ages of Nodes in Complex Networks
021       In a complex network, different groups of nodes may have existed for different amounts of time. 
020       To detect the evolutionary history of a network is of great importance. We present a general method based on spectral analysis to address this fundamental question in network science. In particular, we argue and demonstrate, using model and real-world networks, the existence of positive correlation between the magnitudes of eigenvalues and node ages. In situations where the network topology is unknown but short time series measured from nodes are available, we suggest to uncover the network topology at the present (or any given time of interest) by using compressive sensing and then perform the spectral analysis. Knowledge of ages of various groups of nodes can provide significant insights into the evolutionary process underpinning the network.

010       Controllability of Complex Networks with Nonlinear Dynamics
021       Sun et al. provided an insightful comment <a href="/abs/1108.5739">arXiv:1108.5739v1</a> on our manuscript entitled "Controllability of Complex Networks with Nonlinear Dynamics" on arXiv. 
020       We agree on their main point that linearization about locally desired states can be violated in general by the breakdown of local control of the linearized complex network with nonlinear state. Therefore, we withdraw our manuscript. However, other than nonlinear dynamics, our claim that a single-node-control can fully control the general bidirectional/undirected linear network with 1D self-dynamics is still valid, which is similar to (but different from) the conclusion of <a href="/abs/1106.2573">arXiv:1106.2573v3</a> that all-node-control with a single signal can fully control any direct linear network with nodal-dynamics (1D self-dynamics).

010       Epidemic Spread in Human Networks
021       One of the popular dynamics on complex networks is the epidemic spreading. 
020       An epidemic model describes how infections spread throughout a network. Among the compartmental models used to describe epidemics, the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model has been widely used. In the SIS model, each node can be susceptible, become infected with a given infection rate, and become again susceptible with a given curing rate. In this paper, we add a new compartment to the classic SIS model to account for human response to epidemic spread. Each individual can be infected, susceptible, or alert. Susceptible individuals can become alert with an alerting rate if infected individuals exist in their neighborhood. An individual in the alert state is less probable to become infected than an individual in the susceptible state; due to a newly adopted cautious behavior. The problem is formulated as a continuous-time Markov process on a general static graph and then modeled into a set of ordinary differential equations using mean field approximation method and the corresponding Kolmogorov forward equations. The model is then studied using results from algebraic graph theory and center manifold theorem. We analytically show that our model exhibits two distinct thresholds in the dynamics of epidemic spread. Below the first threshold, infection dies out exponentially. Beyond the second threshold, infection persists in the steady state. Between the two thresholds, the infection spreads at the first stage but then dies out asymptotically as the result of increased alertness in the network. Finally, simulations are provided to support our findings. Our results suggest that alertness can be considered as a strategy of controlling the epidemics which propose multiple potential areas of applications, from infectious diseases mitigations to malware impact reduction.

010       Network Extreme Eigenvalue - from Multimodal to Scale-free Network
021       The extreme eigenvalues of adjacency matrices are important indicators on the influences of topological structures to collective dynamical behavior of complex networks. 
020       Recent findings on the ensemble averageability of the extreme eigenvalue further authenticate its sensibility in the study of network dynamics. Here we determine the ensemble average of the extreme eigenvalue and characterize the deviation across the ensemble through the discrete form of random scale-free network. Remarkably, the analytical approximation derived from the discrete form shows significant improvement over the previous results. This has also led us to the same conclusion as [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 248701 (2007)] that deviation in the reduced extreme eigenvalues vanishes as the network size grows.

020       It proved true that the framework of bilayer networks is powerful for studying the statistical topology structure and dynamics between the fields of ocean and atmosphere. Based on bilayer network, we identify the key correlation regions within and between the air-sea systems. A coupled mechanism between Asia monsoon circulation and Walker circulation is proposed to explain the high correlation phenomenon between the regions on air-sea interaction. We also identify the key regions, which influence the air-sea systems more strongly. The new framework uncovers already known as well other novel features of the air-sea systems and general circulation. It is fruitful to apply the complex networks theory and methodology to understand the complex interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere.

010       Exploring complex networks via topological embedding on surfaces
021       We demonstrate that graphs embedded on surfaces are a powerful and practical tool to generate, characterize and simulate networks with a broad range of properties. 
020       Remarkably, the study of topologically embedded graphs is non-restrictive because any network can be embedded on a surface with sufficiently high genus. The local properties of the network are affected by the surface genus which, for example, produces significant changes in the degree distribution and in the clustering coefficient. The global properties of the graph are also strongly affected by the surface genus which is constraining the degree of interwoveness, changing the scaling properties from large-world-kind (small genus) to small- and ultra-small-world-kind (large genus). Two elementary moves allow the exploration of all networks embeddable on a given surface and naturally introduce a tool to develop a statistical mechanics description. Within such a framework, we study the properties of topologically-embedded graphs at high and low `temperatures' observing the formation of increasingly regular structures by cooling the system. We show that the cooling dynamics is strongly affected by the surface genus with the manifestation of a glassy-like freezing transitions occurring when the amount of topological disorder is low.

010       Reducing Search Lengths with Locally Precomputed Partial Random Walks
021       Random walks can be used to search a complex networks for a desired resource. 
020       To reduce the number of hops necessary to find the resource, we propose a search mechanism based on building random walks connecting together partial walks that have been precomputed at each network node in an initial stage. The resources found in each partial walk are registered in its associated Bloom filter. Searches can then jump over partial nodes in which the resource is not located, significantly reducing search length. However, additional unnecessary hops come from false positives at the Bloom filters. The analytic model provided predicts the expected search length of this mechanism, the optimal size of the partial walks and the corresponding optimal (shortest) expected search length. Simulation experiments are used to validate these predictions and to assess the impact of the number of partial walks precomputed in each node.

020       The team is considered a network with players as nodes and passes as (directed) edges, and a temporal analysis of the resulting passes network is done, looking at the number of passes, length of the chain of passes, and the centrality of players in the turf. Results of the last three matches indicate that the clustering coefficient of the pass network increases with time, and stays high, indicating possession by Spanish players, which eventually leads to victory, even as the density of the pass network decreases with time.

010       Policy Creation Model for Policy-Based Management in Telecommunications   Networks
021       Policy-based management (PBM) is being used as technological solution on the managing and controlling complex networks and systems. 
020       One of the most important issues involved in the life-cycle of PBM is the policies creation because the future decisions made by the management system depend on this, and therefore, the network behavior. In this paper we present a novel model for creating management policies in telecommunications networks. We propose a model which includes a Policy Creation Process, Actors, Policy Abstraction Levels and a Procedure for Creating Policies. An implementation of the proposed model over the Technology Division at University of Cauca is included.

010       DANCE: A Framework for the Distributed Assessment of Network   Centralities
021       The analysis of large-scale complex networks is a major challenge in the Big Data domain. 
020       Given the large-scale of the complex networks researchers commonly deal with nowadays, the use of localized information (i.e. restricted to a limited neighborhood around each node of the network) for centrality-based analysis is gaining momentum in the recent literature. In this context, we propose a framework for the Distributed Assessment of Network Centralities (DANCE) in complex networks. DANCE offers a single environment that allows the use of different localized centrality proposals, which can be tailored to specific applications. This environment can be thus useful given the vast potential applicability of centrality-based analysis on large-scale complex networks found in different areas, such as Biology, Physics, Sociology, or Computer Science. Since the localized centrality proposals DANCE implements employ only localized information, DANCE can easily benefit from parallel processing environments and run on different computing architectures. To illustrate this, we present a parallel implementation of DANCE and show how it can be applied to the analysis of large-scale complex networks using different kinds of network centralities. This implementation is made available to complex network researchers and practitioners interested in using it through a scientific web portal.

010       Localizations on Complex Networks
021       We study the structural characteristics of complex networks using the representative eigenvectors of the adjacent matrix. 
020       The probability distribution function of the components of the representative eigenvectors are proposed to describe the localization on networks where the Euclidean distance is invalid. Several quantities are used to describe the localization properties of the representative states, such as the participation ratio, the structural entropy, and the probability distribution function of the nearest neighbor level spacings for spectra of complex networks. Whole-cell networks in the real world and the Watts-Strogatz small-world and Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks are considered. The networks have nontrivial localization properties due to the nontrivial topological structures. It is found that the ascending-order-ranked series of the occurrence probabilities at the nodes behave generally multifractally. This characteristic can be used as a structural measure of complex networks.

010       Natural growth model of weighted complex networks
021       We propose a natural model of evolving weighted networks in which new links are not necessarily connected to new nodes. 
020       The model allows a newly added link to connect directly two nodes already present in the network. This is plausible in modeling many real-world networks. Such a link is called an inner link, while a link connected to a new node is called an outer link. In view of interrelations between inner and outer links, we investigate power-laws for the strength, degree and weight distributions of weighted complex networks. This model enables us to predict some features of weighted networks such as the worldwide airport network and the scientific collaboration network.

010       Finding Community Structure with Performance Guarantees in Complex   Networks
021       Many networks including social networks, computer networks, and biological networks are found to divide naturally into communities of densely connected individuals. 
020       Finding community structure is one of fundamental problems in network science. Since Newman's suggestion of using \emph{modularity} as a measure to qualify the goodness of community structures, many efficient methods to maximize modularity have been proposed but without a guarantee of optimality. In this paper, we propose two polynomial-time algorithms to the modularity maximization problem with theoretical performance guarantees. The first algorithm comes with a \emph{priori guarantee} that the modularity of found community structure is within a constant factor of the optimal modularity when the network has the power-law degree distribution. Despite being mainly of theoretical interest, to our best knowledge, this is the first approximation algorithm for finding community structure in networks. In our second algorithm, we propose a \emph{sparse metric}, a substantially faster linear programming method for maximizing modularity and apply a rounding technique based on this sparse metric with a \emph{posteriori approximation guarantee}. Our experiments show that the rounding algorithm returns the optimal solutions in most cases and are very scalable, that is, it can run on a network of a few thousand nodes whereas the LP solution in the literature only ran on a network of at most 235 nodes.

010       Multifractal analysis of complex networks
021       Complex networks have recently attracted much attention in diverse areas of science and technology. 
020       Many networks such as the WWW and biological networks are known to display spatial heterogeneity which can be characterized by their fractal dimensions. Multifractal analysis is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. In this paper, we introduce a new box covering algorithm for multifractal analysis of complex networks. This algorithm is used to calculate the generalized fractal dimensions $D_{q}$ of some theoretical networks, namely scale-free networks, small world networks and random networks, and one kind of real networks, namely protein-protein interaction networks of different species. Our numerical results indicate the existence of multifractality in scale-free networks and protein-protein interaction networks, while the multifractal behavior is not clear-cut for small world networks and random networks. The possible variation of $D_{q}$ due to changes in the parameters of the theoretical network models is also discussed.

010       Motifs of Networks from Frictional Interfaces
021       We have developed different network approaches to analyze complex patterns of frictional interfaces (contact area developments). 
020       Network theory is a fundamental tool for the modern understanding of complex systems in which, by a simple graph representation, the elementary units of a system become nodes, and their mutual interactions become links. With this transformation of a system into a network space, many properties of the system's structure and dynamics can be inferred. The rupture sequence of shear fractures were studied using a transformation form of contact patterns to complex networks; subsequently, sub-graph abundance within the corresponding networks was analyzed. To distinguish the different roles of collective deformation of an interface's elements, pure and non-pure contact patches (i.e., aperture) were mapped onto the nodes. The contact patches were connected with each other by using measurements of similarities as well as constrained geometrical distance and amount of net-contact area per patch, which yielded directed and non-directed networks. A universal trend in sub-graph distribution was observed. We confirmed that super-family phenomena are independent from rupture types in shear processes (as well as in slow or sub-Rayleigh fronts). Furthermore, global features of frictional interfaces as well as shear strength or hydraulic properties were scaled with motifs evolution. In particular, it was found that more common transitive motifs indicate residual shear strength stages, where fluctuations of stored potential energy surrounding rupture tip were minimal. Our approaches were tested over different available data sets, and it was found that discrete as well as real-time contact measurements resulted in the same universal patterns of sub-graphs

010       An Anti-attack Model Based on Complex Network Theory in P2P networks
021       Complex network theory is a useful way to study many real systems. 
020       In this paper, an anti-attack model based on complex network theory is introduced. The mechanism of this model is based on dynamic compensation process and reverse percolation process in P2P networks. The main purpose of the paper is: (i) a dynamic compensation process can turn an attacked P2P network into a power-law (PL) network with exponential cutoff; (ii) a local healing process can restore the maximum degree of peers in an attacked P2P network to a normal level; (iii) a restoring process based on reverse percolation theory connects the fragmentary peers of an attacked P2P network together into a giant connected component. In this way, the model based on complex network theory can be effectively utilized for anti-attack and protection purposes in P2P networks.

010       Comment on &quot;Controllability of Complex Networks with Nonlinear Dynamics&quot;
021       The recent paper by W.-X. Wang, Y.-C. 
020       Lai, J. Ren, B. Li &amp; C. Grebogi [<a href="/abs/1107.2177">arXiv:1107.2177v1</a>] proposed a method for the control of complex networks with nonlinear dynamics based on linearizing the system around a finite number of local desired states. The authors purport that any bidirectional network with one-dimensional intrinsic node dynamics can be fully controlled by a single driver node, which can be any node in the network, regardless of the network topology. According to this result, a network with an arbitrarily large number of nodes (a million, a billion, or even more) could be controlled by a single node. Here we show, however, that this result is specious and that it does not hold true even for networks with only two nodes. We demonstrate that the erroneous results are a consequence of a fundamental flaw in the proposed method, namely, that reaching a local desired state using the proposed linearization procedure generally requires a nonlocal trajectory, which grossly violates the linear approximation. Their further conclusion that network systems with nonlinear dynamics are more controllable than those with linear dynamics is a known fact presented as novel based on a flawed argument. A central problem underlying the authors' argument is that their formulation is entirely based on the number of driver nodes required to reach a desired state---even when this number is one, keeping the system at that desired state generally requires directly controlling all nodes in the network. When this is taken into account, the conclusion that nonlinear dynamics can facilitate network control was already anticipated in S.P. Cornelius, W.L. Kath &amp; A.E. Motter [<a href="/abs/1105.3726">arXiv:1105.3726v1</a>], which is not referenced in their paper. If one insists on using the authors' formulation, then, in contradiction to their claim, nonlinear systems would never be more controllable than linear ones because...

010       Pheromone Static Routing Strategy for Complex Networks
021       In this paper, we adopt the concept of pheromone to generate a set of static paths that can reach the performance of global dynamic routing strategy [Phys. 
020       Rev. E 81, 016113(2010)]. In the test stage, pheromone is dropped to the nodes by packets forwarded by the global dynamic routing strategy. After that, static paths are generated according to the density of pheromone. The output paths can greatly improve traffic systems' overall capacity on different network structures, including scale-free networks, small-world networks and random graphs. Because the paths are static, the system needs much less computational resource than the global dynamic routing strategy.

010       Structural preferential attachment: Stochastic process for the growth of   scale-free, modular and self-similar systems
021       Many complex systems have been shown to share universal properties of organization, such as scale independence, modularity and self-similarity. 
020       We borrow tools from statistical physics in order to study structural preferential attachment (SPA), a recently proposed growth principle for the emergence of the aforementioned properties. We study the corresponding stochastic process in terms of its time evolution, its asymptotic behavior and the scaling properties of its statistical steady state. Moreover, approximations are introduced to facilitate the modelling of real systems, mainly complex networks, using SPA. Finally, we investigate a particular behavior observed in the stochastic process, the peloton dynamics, and show how it predicts some features of real growing systems using prose samples as an example.

010       Stochastic (in)stability of synchronisation of oscillators on networks
021       We consider the influence of correlated noise on the stability of synchronisation of oscillators on a general network using the Kuramoto model for coupled phases $\theta_i$. 
020       Near the fixed point $\theta_i \approx \theta_j \ \forall i,j$ the impact of the noise is analysed through the Fokker-Planck equation. We deem the stochastic system to be `weakly unstable' if the Mean First Passage Time for the system to drift outside the fixed point basin of attraction is less than the time for which the noise is sustained. We argue that a Mean First Passage Time, computed near the phase synchronised fixed point, gives a useful lower bound on the tolerance of the system to noise. Applying the saddle point approximation, we analytically derive general thresholds for the noise parameters for weak stochastic stability. We illustrate this by numerically solving the full Kuramoto model in the presence of noise for an example complex network.

010       Entropy rate of non-equilibrium growing networks
021       New entropy measures have been recently introduced for the quantification of the complexity of networks. 
020       Most of these entropy measures apply to static networks or to dynamical processes defined on static complex networks. In this paper we define the entropy rate of growing network models. This entropy rate quantifies how many labeled networks are typically generated by the growing network models. We analytically evaluate the difference between the entropy rate of growing tree network models and the entropy of tree networks that have the same asymptotic degree distribution. We find that the growing networks with linear preferential attachment generated by dynamical models are exponentially less than the static networks with the same degree distribution for a large variety of relevant growing network models. We study the entropy rate for growing network models showing structural phase transitions including models with non-linear preferential attachment. Finally, we bring numerical evidence that the entropy rate above and below the structural phase transitions follow a different scaling with the network size.

010       Localization on low-order eigenvectors of data matrices
021       Eigenvector localization refers to the situation when most of the components of an eigenvector are zero or near-zero. 
020       This phenomenon has been observed on eigenvectors associated with extremal eigenvalues, and in many of those cases it can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of "structural heterogeneities" in the data. For example, the largest eigenvectors of adjacency matrices of large complex networks often have most of their mass localized on high-degree nodes; and the smallest eigenvectors of the Laplacians of such networks are often localized on small but meaningful community-like sets of nodes. Here, we describe localization associated with low-order eigenvectors, i.e., eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues that are not extremal but that are "buried" further down in the spectrum. Although we have observed it in several unrelated applications, this phenomenon of low-order eigenvector localization defies common intuitions and simple explanations, and it creates serious difficulties for the applicability of popular eigenvector-based machine learning and data analysis tools. After describing two examples where low-order eigenvector localization arises, we present a very simple model that qualitatively reproduces several of the empirically-observed results. This model suggests certain coarse structural similarities among the seemingly-unrelated applications where we have observed low-order eigenvector localization, and it may be used as a diagnostic tool to help extract insight from data graphs when such low-order eigenvector localization is present.

010       Feigenbaum graphs: a complex network perspective of chaos
021       The recently formulated theory of horizontal visibility graphs transforms time series into graphs and allows the possibility of studying dynamical systems through the characterization of their associated networks. 
020       This method leads to a natural graph-theoretical description of nonlinear systems with qualities in the spirit of symbolic dynamics. We support our claim via the case study of the period-doubling and band-splitting attractor cascades that characterize unimodal maps. We provide a universal analytical description of this classic scenario in terms of the horizontal visibility graphs associated with the dynamics within the attractors, that we call Feigenbaum graphs, independent of map nonlinearity or other particulars. We derive exact results for their degree distribution and related quantities, recast them in the context of the renormalization group and find that its fixed points coincide with those of network entropy optimization. Furthermore, we show that the network entropy mimics the Lyapunov exponent of the map independently of its sign, hinting at a Pesin-like relation equally valid out of chaos.

010       Enrichment and aggregation of topological motifs are independent   organizational principles of integrated interaction networks
021       Topological network motifs represent functional relationships within and between regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks. 
020       Enriched motifs often aggregate into self-contained units forming functional modules. Theoretical models for network evolution by duplication-divergence mechanisms and for network topology by hierarchical scale-free networks have suggested a one-to-one relation between network motif enrichment and aggregation, but this relation has never been tested quantitatively in real biological interaction networks. Here we introduce a novel method for assessing the statistical significance of network motif aggregation and for identifying clusters of overlapping network motifs. Using an integrated network of transcriptional, posttranslational and protein-protein interactions in yeast we show that network motif aggregation reflects a local modularity property which is independent of network motif enrichment. In particular our method identified novel functional network themes for a set of motifs which are not enriched yet aggregate significantly and challenges the conventional view that network motif enrichment is the most basic organizational principle of complex networks.

010       Uncovering the hidden geometry behind metabolic networks
021       Metabolism is a fascinating cell machinery underlying life and disease and genome-scale reconstructions provide us with a captivating view of its complexity. 
020       However, deciphering the relationship between metabolic structure and function remains a major challenge. In particular, turning observed structural regularities into organizing principles underlying systemic functions is a crucial task that can be significantly addressed after endowing complex network representations of metabolism with the notion of geometric distance. Here, we design a cartographic map of metabolic networks by embedding them into a simple geometry that provides a natural explanation for their observed network topology and that codifies node proximity as a measure of hidden structural similarities. We assume a simple and general connectivity law that gives more probability of interaction to metabolite/reaction pairs which are closer in the hidden space. Remarkably, we find an astonishing congruency between the architecture of E. coli and human cell metabolisms and the underlying geometry. In addition, the formalism unveils a backbone-like structure of connected biochemical pathways on the basis of a quantitative cross-talk. Pathways thus acquire a new perspective which challenges their classical view as self-contained functional units.

010       The Organization of Strong Links in Complex Networks
021       A small-world topology characterizes many complex systems including the structural and functional organization of brain networks. 
020       The topology allows simultaneously for local and global efficiency in the interaction of the system constituents. However, it ignores the gradations of interactions commonly quantified by the link weight, w. Here, we identify an integrative weight organization for brain, gene, social, and language networks, in which strong links preferentially occur between nodes with overlapping neighbourhoods and the small-world properties are robust to removal of a large fraction of the weakest links. We also determine local learning rules that dynamically establish such weight organization in response to past activity and capacity demands, while preserving efficient local and global communication.

010       The bounds of heavy-tailed return distributions in evolving complex   networks
021       We consider the evolution of scale-free networks according to preferential attachment schemes and show the conditions for which the exponent characterizing the degree distribution is bounded by upper and lower values. 
020       Our framework is an agent model, presented in the context of economic networks of trades, which shows the emergence of critical behavior. Starting from a brief discussion about the main features of the evolving network of trades, we show that the logarithmic return distributions have bounded heavy-tails, and the corresponding bounding exponent values can be derived. Finally, we discuss these findings in the context of model risk.

010       The Physics of Communicability in Complex Networks
021       A fundamental problem in the study of complex networks is to provide quantitative measures of correlation and information flow between different parts of a system. 
020       To this end, several notions of communicability have been introduced and applied to a wide variety of real-world networks in recent years. Several such communicability functions are reviewed in this paper. It is emphasized that communication and correlation in networks can take place through many more routes than the shortest paths, a fact that may not have been sufficiently appreciated in previously proposed correlation measures. In contrast to these, the communicability measures reviewed in this paper are defined by taking into account all possible routes between two nodes, assigning smaller weights to longer ones. This point of view naturally leads to the definition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the exponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument is either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the network. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a network as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both classical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions. Applications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are illustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks. The last part of the paper is devoted to a review of the notion of locality in complex networks and to computational aspects that by exploiting sparsity can greatly reduce the computational efforts for the calculation of communicability functions for large networks.

010       Unveiling the Relationship Between Structure and Dynamics in Complex   Networks
021       Over the last years, a great deal of attention has been focused on complex networked systems, characterized by intricate structure and dynamics. 
020       The latter has been often represented in terms of overall statistics (e.g. average and standard deviations) of the time signals. While such approaches have led to many insights, they have failed to take into account that signals at different parts of the system can undergo distinct evolutions, which cannot be properly represented in terms of average values. A novel framework for identifying the principal aspects of the dynamics and how it is influenced by the network structure is proposed in this work. The potential of this approach is illustrated with respect to three important models (Integrate-and-Fire, SIS and Kuramoto), allowing the identification of highly structured dynamics, in the sense that different groups of nodes not only presented specific dynamics but also felt the structure of the network in different ways.

010       Roulette-wheel selection via stochastic acceptance
021       Roulette-wheel selection is a frequently used method in genetic and evolutionary algorithms or in modeling of complex networks. 
020       Existing routines select one of N individuals using search algorithms of O(N) or O(log(N)) complexity. We present a simple roulette-wheel selection algorithm, which typically has O(1) complexity and is based on stochastic acceptance instead of searching. We also discuss a hybrid version, which might be suitable for highly heterogeneous weight distributions, found, for example, in some models of complex networks. With minor modifications, the algorithm might also be used for sampling with fitness cut-off at a certain value or for sampling without replacement.

010       Disentangling Social and Group heterogeneities: Public Goods games on   Complex Networks
021       In this Letter we present a new perspective for the study of the Public Goods games on complex networks. 
020       The idea of our approach is to consider a realistic structure for the groups in which Public goods games are played. Instead of assuming that the social network of contacts self-defines a group structure with identical topological properties, we disentangle these two interaction patterns so to deal with systems having groups of definite sizes embedded in social networks with a tunable degree of heterogeneity. Surpisingly, this realistic framework, reveals that social heterogeneity may not foster cooperation depending on the game setting and the updating rule.

010       Controlling centrality in complex networks
021       Spectral centrality measures allow to identify influential individuals in social groups, to rank Web pages by their popularity, and even to determine the impact of scientific researches. 
020       The centrality score of a node within a network crucially depends on the entire pattern of connections, so that the usual approach is to compute the node centralities once the network structure is assigned. We face here with the inverse problem, that is, we study how to modify the centrality scores of the nodes by acting on the structure of a given network. We prove that there exist particular subsets of nodes, called controlling sets, which can assign any prescribed set of centrality values to all the nodes of a graph, by cooperatively tuning the weights of their out-going links. We show that many large networks from the real world have surprisingly small controlling sets, containing even less than 5-10% of the nodes. These results suggest that rankings obtained from spectral centrality measures have to be considered with extreme care, since they can be easily controlled and even manipulated by a small group of nodes acting in a coordinated way.

010       Constructing and sampling directed graphs with given degree sequences
021       The interactions between the components of complex networks are often directed. 
020       Proper modeling of such systems frequently requires the construction of ensembles of digraphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. As the number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free, guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or from any other chosen distribution.

021       Spectral decomposition has been rarely used to investigate complex networks. 
020       In this work we apply this concept in order to define two types of link-directed attacks while quantifying their respective effects on the topology. Several other types of more traditional attacks are also adopted and compared. These attacks had substantially diverse effects, depending on each specific network (models and real-world structures). It is also showed that the spectral-based attacks have special effect in affecting the transitivity of the networks.

010       Markov dynamics as a zooming lens for multiscale community detection:   non clique-like communities and the field-of-view limit
021       In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in community detection algorithms for complex networks. 
020       A variety of computational heuristics, some with a long history, have been proposed for the identification of communities or, alternatively, of good graph partitions. In most cases, the algorithms maximize a particular objective function, thereby finding the `right' split into communities. Although a thorough comparison of algorithms is still lacking, there has been an effort to design benchmarks, i.e., random graph models with known community structure against which algorithms can be evaluated. However, popular community detection methods and benchmarks normally assume an implicit notion of community based on clique-like subgraphs, a form of community structure that is not always characteristic of real networks. Specifically, networks that emerge from geometric constraints can have natural non clique-like substructures with large effective diameters, which can be interpreted as long-range communities. In this work, we show that long-range communities escape detection by popular methods, which are blinded by a restricted `field-of-view' limit, an intrinsic upper scale on the communities they can detect. The field-of-view limit means that long-range communities tend to be overpartitioned. We show how by adopting a dynamical perspective towards community detection (Delvenne et al. (2010) PNAS:107: 12755-12760; Lambiotte et al. (2008) <a href="/abs/0812.1770">arXiv:0812.1770</a>), in which the evolution of a Markov process on the graph is used as a zooming lens over the structure of the network at all scales, one can detect both clique- or non clique-like communities without imposing an upper scale to the detection. Consequently, the performance of algorithms on inherently low-diameter, clique-like benchmarks may not always be indicative of equally good results in real networks with local, sparser connectivity.

010       Hamiltonian traffic dynamics in microfluidic-loop networks
021       Recent microfluidic experiments revealed that large particles advected in a fluidic loop display long-range hydrodynamic interactions. 
020       However, the consequences of such couplings on the traffic dynamics in more complex networks remain poorly understood. In this letter, we focus on the transport of a finite number of particles in one-dimensional loop networks. By combining numerical, theoretical, and experimental efforts, we evidence that this collective process offers a unique example of Hamiltonian dynamics for hydrodynamically interacting particles. In addition, we show that the asymptotic trajectories are necessarily reciprocal despite the microscopic traffic rules explicitly break the time reversal symmetry. We exploit these two remarkable properties to account for the salient features of the effective three-particle interaction induced by the exploration of fluidic loops.

010       Effect of the nature of randomness on quenching dynamics of Ising model   on complex networks
021       Randomness is known to affect the dynamical behaviour of many systems to a large extent. 
020       In this paper we investigate how the nature of randomness affects the dynamics in a zero temperature quench of Ising model on two types of random networks. In both the networks, which are embedded in a one dimensional space, the first neighbour connections exist and the average degree is four per node. In the random model A, the second neighbour connections are rewired with a probability $p$ while in the random model B, additional connections between neighbours at Euclidean distance $l ~ (l &gt;1)$ are introduced with a probability $P(l) \propto l^{-\alpha}$. We find that for both models, the dynamics leads to freezing such that the system gets locked in a disordered state. The point at which the disorder of the nonequilibrium steady state is maximum is located. Behaviour of dynamical quantities like residual energy, order parameter and persistence are discussed and compared. Overall, the behaviour of physical quantities are similar although subtle differences are observed due to the difference in the nature of randomness.

010       Cross-Layer Protocols for Multimedia Communications over Wireless   Networks
021       In the last few years, the Internet throughput, usage and reliability have increased almost exponentially. 
020       The introduction of broadband wireless mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased computational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be created, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time multimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly challenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS) requirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet protocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent requirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource constrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve perceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can be addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer and link layer. Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this adaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless medium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that the rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the requirements of the applications given the current channel and network conditions. A number of propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the literature. In this chapter, an extensive review has been made on these cross-layer architectures that combine the application-layer, transport layer and the link layer controls. Particularly, the issues like channel estimation techniques, adaptive controls at the application and link layers for energy efficiency, priority based scheduling, transmission rate control at the transport layer, and adaptive automatic repeat request (ARQ) are discussed in detail.

010       Multifractality of complex networks
021       We demonstrate analytically and numerically the possibility that the fractal property of a scale-free network cannot be characterized by a unique fractal dimension and the network takes a multifractal structure. 
020       It is found that the mass exponents $\tau(q)$ for several deterministic, stochastic, and real-world fractal scale-free networks are nonlinear functions of $q$, which implies that structural measures of these networks obey the multifractal scaling. In addition, we give a general expression of $\tau(q)$ for some class of fractal scale-free networks by a mean-field approximation. The multifractal property of network structures is a consequence of large fluctuations of local node density in scale-free networks.

010       An evolving network model with modular growth
021       In this paper, we propose an evolving network model growing fast in units of module, based on the analysis of the evolution characteristics in real complex networks. 
020       Each module is a small-world network containing several interconnected nodes, and the nodes between the modules are linked by preferential attachment on degree of nodes. We study the modularity measure of the proposed model, which can be adjusted by changing ratio of the number of inner-module edges and the number of inter-module edges. Based on the mean field theory, we develop an analytical function of the degree distribution, which is verified by a numerical example and indicates that the degree distribution shows characteristics of the small-world network and the scale-free network distinctly at different segments. The clustering coefficient and the average path length of the network are simulated numerically, indicating that the network shows the small-world property and is affected little by the randomness of the new module.

010       Iterative Methods for Scalable Uncertainty Quantification in Complex   Networks
021       In this paper we address the problem of uncertainty management for robust design, and verification of large dynamic networks whose performance is affected by an equally large number of uncertain parameters. 
020       Many such networks (e.g. power, thermal and communication networks) are often composed of weakly interacting subnetworks. We propose intrusive and non-intrusive iterative schemes that exploit such weak interconnections to overcome dimensionality curse associated with traditional uncertainty quantification methods (e.g. generalized Polynomial Chaos, Probabilistic Collocation) and accelerate uncertainty propagation in systems with large number of uncertain parameters. This approach relies on integrating graph theoretic methods and waveform relaxation with generalized Polynomial Chaos, and Probabilistic Collocation, rendering these techniques scalable. We analyze convergence properties of this scheme and illustrate it on several examples.

010       Epidemic centrality - is there an underestimated epidemic impact of   network peripheral nodes?
021       In the study of disease spreading on empirical complex networks in SIR model, initially infected nodes can be ranked according to some measure of their epidemic impact. 
020       The highest ranked nodes, also referred to as "superspreaders", are associated to dominant epidemic risks and therefore deserve special attention. In simulations on studied empirical complex networks, it is shown that the ranking depends on the dynamical regime of the disease spreading. A possible mechanism leading to this dependence is illustrated in an analytically tractable example. In systems where the allocation of resources to counter disease spreading to individual nodes is based on their ranking, the dynamical regime of disease spreading is frequently not known before the outbreak of the disease. Therefore, we introduce a quantity called epidemic centrality as an average over all relevant regimes of disease spreading as a basis of the ranking. A recently introduced concept of phase diagram of epidemic spreading is used as a framework in which several types of averaging are studied. The epidemic centrality is compared to structural properties of nodes such as node degree, k-cores and betweenness. There is a growing trend of epidemic centrality with degree and k-cores values, but the variation of epidemic centrality is much smaller than the variation of degree or k-cores value. It is found that the epidemic centrality of the structurally peripheral nodes is of the same order of magnitude as the epidemic centrality of the structurally central nodes. The implications of these findings for the distributions of resources to counter disease spreading are discussed.

010       Scaling of nestedness in complex networks
021       Nestedness characterizes the linkage pattern of networked systems, indicating the likelihood that a node is linked to the nodes linked to the nodes with larger degrees than it. 
020       Networks of mutualistic relationship between distinct groups of species in ecological communities exhibit such nestedness, which is known to support the network robustness. Despite such importance, quantitative characteristics of nestedness is little understood. Here we take graph-theoretic approach to derive the scaling properties of nestedness in various model networks. Our results show how the heterogeneous connectivity patterns enhance nestedness. Also we find that the nestedness of bipartite networks depend sensitively on the fraction of different types of nodes, causing nestedness to scale differently for nodes of different types.

010       Multiple dynamical time-scales in networks with hierarchically nested   modular organization
021       Many natural and engineered complex networks have intricate mesoscopic organization, e.g., the clustering of the constituent nodes into several communities or modules. 
020       Often, such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels, where the clusters defined at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks, where fast intra-modular and slow inter-modular processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of events occurring at different spatial scales.

010       Distributed flow optimization and cascading effects in weighted complex   networks
021       We investigate the effect of a specific edge weighting scheme $\sim (k_i k_j)^{\beta}$ on distributed flow efficiency and robustness to cascading failures in scale-free networks. 
020       In particular, we analyze a simple, yet fundamental distributed flow model: current flow in random resistor networks. By the tuning of control parameter $\beta$ and by considering two general cases of relative node processing capabilities as well as the effect of bandwidth, we show the dependence of transport efficiency upon the correlations between the topology and weights. By studying the severity of cascades for different control parameter $\beta$, we find that network resilience to cascading overloads and network throughput is optimal for the same value of $\beta$ over the range of node capacities and available bandwidth.

010       Robust classification of salient links in complex networks
021       Complex networks in natural, social, and technological systems generically exhibit an abundance of rich information. 
020       Extracting meaningful structural features from data is one of the most challenging tasks in network theory. Many methods and concepts have been proposed to address this problem such as centrality statistics, motifs, community clusters, and backbones, but such schemes typically rely on external and arbitrary parameters. It is unknown whether generic networks permit the classification of elements without external intervention. Here we show that link salience is a robust approach to classifying network elements based on a consensus estimate of all nodes. A wide range of empirical networks exhibit a natural, network-implicit classification of links into qualitatively distinct groups, and the salient skeletons have generic statistical properties. Salience also predicts essential features of contagion phenomena on networks, and points towards a better understanding of universal features in empirical networks that are masked by their complexity.

010       Markov-Binary Visibility Graph: a new method for analyzing Complex   Systems
021       In this work, we introduce a new and simple transformation from time series to complex networks based on markov-binary visibility graph(MBVG). 
020       Due to the simple structure of this transformation in comparison with other transformations be obtained more precise results. Moreover, several topological aspects of the constructed graph, such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and mean visibility length have been thoroughly investigated. Numerical simulations confirm the reliability of markov-binary visibility graph for time series analysis. This algorithm have the capability of distinguishing between uncorrelated and correlated systems. Finaly, we illustrate this algorithm analyzing the human heartbeat dynamics. The results indicate that the human heartbeat (RR-interval) time series of normally, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and Atrial Fibrillation (AF) subjects are uncorrelated, chaotic and correlated stochastic systems, respectively.

010       Impact of boundaries on fully connected random geometric networks
021       Many complex networks exhibit a percolation transition involving a macroscopic connected component, with universal features largely independent of the microscopic model and the macroscopic domain geometry. 
020       In contrast, we show that the transition to full connectivity is strongly influenced by details of the boundary, but observe an alternative form of universality. Our approach correctly distinguishes connectivity properties of networks in domains with equal bulk contributions. It also facilitates system design to promote or avoid full connectivity for diverse geometries in arbitrary dimension.

010       Removing spurious interactions in complex networks
021       Identifying and removing spurious links in complex networks is a meaningful problem for many real applications and is crucial for improving the reliability of network data, which in turn can lead to a better understanding of the highly interconnected nature of various social, biological and communication systems. 
020       In this work we study the features of different simple spurious link elimination methods, revealing that they may lead to the distortion of networks' structural and dynamical properties. Accordingly, we propose a hybrid method which combines similarity-based index and edge-betweenness centrality. We show that our method can effectively eliminate the spurious interactions while leaving the network connected and preserving the network's functionalities.

010       Explosive synchronization enhanced by time-delayed coupling
021       We study the emergence of synchronization in scale-free networks by considering the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. 
020       The natural frequencies of oscillators are assumed to be correlated with their degrees and a time delay is included in the system. This assumption allows enhancing the explosive transition to reach the synchronous state. We provide an analytical treatment developed in a star graph which reproduces results obtained in scale-free networks. Our findings have important implications in understanding the synchronization of complex networks, since the time delay is present in most systems due to the finite speed of the signal transmission over a distance.

010       Unfolding Substructures of Complex Networks by Coupling Chaotic   Oscillators beyond Global Synchronization Regime
021       In the past decade, synchronization on complex networks has attracted increasing attentions from various research disciplines. 
020       Most previous works, however, focus only on the dynamic behaviors of synchronization process in the stable region, i.e., global synchronization. In this letter, we demonstrate that synchronization process on complex networks can efficiently reveal the substructures of networks when the coupling strength of chaotic oscillators is under the lower boundary of stable region. Both analytic and numerical results show that the nodes belonging to the same component in the hierarchical network are tightly clustered according to the Euclidean distances between the state vectors of the corresponding oscillators, and different levels of hierarchy can be systematically unfolded by gradually tuning the coupling strength. When the coupling strengths exceed the upper boundary of stable region, the hierarchy of the network cannot be recognized by this approach. Extensive simulations suggest that our method may provide a powerful tool to detect the hierarchical community structure of complex systems and deep insight into the relationship between structure and dynamics of complex systems.

010       Self-similar scaling of density in complex real-world networks
021       Despite their diverse origin, networks of large real-world systems reveal a number of common properties including small-world phenomena, scale-free degree distributions and modularity. 
020       Recently, network self-similarity as a natural outcome of the evolution of real-world systems has also attracted much attention within the physics literature. Here we investigate the scaling of density in complex networks under two classical box-covering renormalizations-network coarse-graining-and also different community-based renormalizations. The analysis on over 50 real-world networks reveals a power-law scaling of network density and size under adequate renormalization technique, yet irrespective of network type and origin. The results thus advance a recent discovery of a universal scaling of density among different real-world networks [Laurienti et al., Physica A 390 (20) (2011) 3608-3613.] and imply an existence of a scale-free density also within-among different self-similar scales of-complex real-world networks. The latter further improves the comprehension of self-similar structure in large real-world networks with several possible applications.

010       Heterogeneity shapes groups growth in social online communities
021       Many complex systems are characterized by broad distributions capturing, for example, the size of firms, the population of cities or the degree distribution of complex networks. 
020       Typically this feature is explained by means of a preferential growth mechanism. Although heterogeneity is expected to play a role in the evolution it is usually not considered in the modeling probably due to a lack of empirical evidence on how it is distributed. We characterize the intrinsic heterogeneity of groups in an online community and then show that together with a simple linear growth and an inhomogeneous birth rate it explains the broad distribution of group members.

010       Correlated multiplexity and connectivity of multiplex random networks
021       Nodes in a complex networked system often engage in more than one type of interactions among them; they form a multiplex network with multiple types of links. 
020       In real-world complex systems, a node's degree for one type of links and that for the other are not randomly distributed but correlated, which we term correlated multiplexity. In this paper we study a simple model of multiplex random networks and demonstrate that the correlated multiplexity can drastically affect the properties of giant component in the network. Specifically, when the degrees of a node for different interactions in a duplex Erdos-Renyi network are maximally correlated, the network contains the giant component for any nonzero link densities. In contrast, when the degrees of a node are maximally anti-correlated, the emergence of giant component is significantly delayed, yet the entire network becomes connected into a single component at a finite link density. We also discuss the mixing patterns and the cases with imperfect correlated multiplexity.

010       Game Theoretic Iterative Partitioning for Dynamic Load Balancing in   Distributed Network Simulation
021       High fidelity simulation of large-sized complex networks can be realized on a distributed computing platform that leverages the combined resources of multiple processors or machines. 
020       In a discrete event driven simulation, the assignment of logical processes (LPs) to machines is a critical step that affects the computational and communication burden on the machines, which in turn affects the simulation execution time of the experiment. We study a network partitioning game wherein each node (LP) acts as a selfish player. We derive two local node-level cost frameworks which are feasible in the sense that the aggregate state information required to be exchanged between the machines is independent of the size of the simulated network model. For both cost frameworks, we prove the existence of stable Nash equilibria in pure strategies. Using iterative partition improvements, we propose game theoretic partitioning algorithms based on the two cost criteria and show that each descends in a global cost. To exploit the distributed nature of the system, the algorithm is distributed, with each node's decision based on its local information and on a few global quantities which can be communicated machine-to-machine. We demonstrate the performance of our partitioning algorithm on an optimistic discrete event driven simulation platform that models an actual parallel simulator.

010       Supercondutor-Insulator Transition on Annealed Complex Networks
021       Cuprates show multiphase complexity that has hindered physicists search for the mechanism of high T_c for many years. 
020       A fingerprint of electronic scale invariance has been reported recently by Fratini et al. by detecting the structural scale invariance of dopants using scanning micro x-ray diffraction. In order to shed light on critical phenomena on these materials, here we propose a stylized model capturing the essential characteristics of the superconducting-isulator transition of a highly dynamical, heterogenous granular material: the Disordered Quantum Tranverse Ising Model (DQTIM) on Annealed Complex Network. We show that when the networks encode for high heterogeneity of the expected degrees described by a power law distribution, the critical temperature for the onset of the supercoducting phase diverges to infinity as the power-law exponent \gamma of the expected degree distribution is less than 3, i.e. \gamma&lt;3. Moreover we investigate the case in which the critical state of the electronic background is triggered by an external parameter g that determines an exponential cutoff in the power law expected degree distribution characterized by an exponent \gamma. We find that for g=g_c the critical temperature for the superconduting-insulator transition has a maximum is \gamma&gt;3 and diverges if \gamma&lt;3.

010       Zero forcing, linear and quantum controllability for systems evolving on   networks
021       We study the dynamics of systems on networks from a linear algebraic perspective. 
020       The control theoretic concept of controllability describes the set of states that can be reached for these systems. Under appropriate conditions, there is a connection between the quantum (Lie theoretic) property of controllability and the linear systems (Kalman) controllability condition. We investigate how the graph theoretic concept of a zero forcing set impacts the controllability property. In particular, we prove that if a set of vertices is a zero forcing set, the associated dynamical system is controllable. The results open up the possibility of further exploiting the analogy between networks, linear control systems theory, and quantum systems Lie algebraic theory. This study is motivated by several quantum systems currently under study, including continuous quantum walks modeling transport phenomena. Additionally, it proposes zero forcing as a new notion in the analysis of complex networks.

010       Mean first-passage time for random walks on undirected networks

020       We then apply the formula to derive a lower bound for the MFPT to arrive at a given node with the starting point chosen from the stationary distribution over the set of nodes. We show that for a correlated scale-free network of size $N$ with a degree distribution $P(d)\sim d^{-\gamma}$, the scaling of the lower bound is $N^{1-1/\gamma}$. Also, we provide a simple derivation for an eigentime identity. Our work leads to a comprehensive understanding of recent results about random walks on complex networks, especially on scale-free networks.

010       Properties of Interstellar Turbulence from Gradients of Linear Radio   Polarization Maps
021       Faraday rotation of linearly polarized radio signals provides a very sensitive probe of fluctuations in the interstellar magnetic field and ionized gas density resulting from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. 
020       We used a set of statistical tools to analyze images of the spatial gradient of linearly polarized radio emission ($|\nabla \textbf{P}|$) from the ISM for both observational data from a test image of the Southern Galactic Plane Survey (SGPS) and isothermal simulations of MHD turbulence. We compared the observational data with results of synthetic observations obtained with the simulations of 3D turbulence. Visually, in both data sets, a complex network of filamentary structures is seen. Our analysis shows that the filaments in the gradient can be produced by shocks as well as random fluctuations characterizing the non-differentiable field of MHD turbulence. The latter dominates for subsonic turbulence, while the former dominates for supersonic turbulence. In order to quantitatively characterize these differences we use the topology tool known as a genus curve as well as the moments of the image distribution. We find that higher values for the moments correspond to cases of $|\nabla \textbf{P}|$ with larger Mach numbers, but the strength of the dependency is connected to the telescope angular resolution. In regards to the topology, the supersonic filaments observed in $|\nabla \textbf{P}|$ have a positive genus shift, which indicates a "swisscheese" like topology, while the subsonic cases show a negative genus, indicating a "clump" like topology. In the case of the genus, the dependency on the telescope resolution is not as strong. The SGPS test region data has a distribution and morphology that matches subsonic to transsonic type turbulence, which independently confirms what is now expected for the WIM.

010       Features and heterogeneities in growing network models
021       Many complex networks from the World-Wide-Web to biological networks are growing taking into account the heterogeneous features of the nodes. 
020       The feature of a node might be a discrete quantity such as a classification of a URL document as personal page, thematic website, news, blog, search engine, social network, ect. or the classification of a gene in a functional module. Moreover the feature of a node can be a continuous variable such as the position of a node in the embedding space. In order to account for these properties, in this paper we provide a generalization of growing network models with preferential attachment that includes the effect of heterogeneous features of the nodes. The main effect of heterogeneity is the emergence of an "effective fitness" for each class of nodes, determining the rate at which nodes acquire new links. The degree distribution exhibits a multiscaling behaviour analogous to the the fitness model. This property is robust with respect to variations in the model, as long as links are assigned through effective preferential attachment. Beyond the degree distribution, in this paper we give a full characterization of the other relevant properties of the model. We evaluate the clustering coefficient and show that it disappears for large network size, a property shared with the Barab\'asi-Albert model. Negative degree correlations are also present in the studied class of models, along with non-trivial mixing patterns among features. We therefore conclude that both small clustering coefficients and disassortative mixing are outcomes of the preferential attachment mechanism in general growing networks.

010       Locating privileged spreaders on an Online Social Network
021       Social media have provided plentiful evidence of their capacity for information diffusion. 
020       Fads and rumors, but also social unrest and riots travel fast and affect large fractions of the population participating in online social networks (OSNs). This has spurred much research regarding the mechanisms that underlie social contagion, and also who (if any) can unleash system-wide information dissemination. Access to real data, both regarding topology --the network of friendships-- and dynamics --the actual way in which OSNs users interact--, is crucial to decipher how the former facilitates the latter's success, understood as efficiency in information spreading. With the quantitative analysis that stems from complex network theory, we discuss who (and why) has privileged spreading capabilities when it comes to information diffusion. This is done considering the evolution of an episode of political protest which took place in Spain, spanning one month in 2011.

010       Biased diffusion on Japanese inter-firm trading network: Estimation of   sales from network structure
021       To investigate the actual phenomena of transport on a complex network, we analysed empirical data for an inter-firm trading network, which consists of about one million Japanese firms and the sales of these firms (a sale corresponds to the total in-flow into a node). 
020       First, we analysed the relationships between sales and sales of nearest neighbourhoods from which we obtain a simple linear relationship between sales and the weighted sum of sales of nearest neighbourhoods (i.e., customers). In addition, we introduce a simple money transport model that is coherent with this empirical observation. In this model, a firm (i.e., customer) distributes money to its out-edges (suppliers) proportionally to the in-degree of destinations. From intensive numerical simulations, we find that the steady flows derived from these models can approximately reproduce the distribution of sales of actual firms. The sales of individual firms deduced from the money-transport model are shown to be proportional, on an average, to the real sales.

010       Evolution of a Modular Software Network
021       "Evolution behaves like a tinkerer" (Francois Jacob, Science, 1977). 
020       Software systems provide a unique opportunity to understand biological processes using concepts from network theory. The Debian GNU/Linux operating system allows us to explore the evolution of a complex network in a novel way. The modular design detected during its growth is based on the reuse of existing code in order to minimize costs during programming. The increase of modularity experienced by the system over time has not counterbalanced the increase in incompatibilities between software packages within modules. This negative effect is far from being a failure of design. A random process of package installation shows that the higher the modularity the larger the fraction of packages working properly in a local computer. The decrease in the relative number of conflicts between packages from different modules avoids a failure in the functionality of one package spreading throughout the entire system. Some potential analogies with the evolutionary and ecological processes determining the structure of ecological networks of interacting species are discussed.

010       Range-limited Centrality Measures in Complex Networks
021       Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both non-weighted and weighted directed complex networks. 
020       We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\ell = 1,...,L$ in case of non-weighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than $w_{\ell}=\ell \Delta$, $\ell=1,2...,L=R/\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods 1-step out, 2-steps out, etc. up to including the whole network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large non-weighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top-list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top-list can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest node-to-node distance for a network of $N$ nodes, exploiting the aforementioned scaling behavior. These observations are illustrated on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim 5.5\times 10^6$ nodes and $\sim 2.7\times 10^7$ edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted networks in detecting such backbones.

010       The diminishing role of hubs in dynamical processes on complex networks
021       It is notoriously difficult to predict the behaviour of a complex self-organizing system, where the interactions among dynamical units form a heterogeneous topology. 
020       Even if the dynamics of each microscopic unit is known, a real understanding of their contributions to the macroscopic system behaviour is still lacking. Here we develop information-theoretical methods to distinguish the contribution of each individual unit to the collective out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We show that for a system of units connected by a network of interaction potentials with an arbitrary degree distribution, highly connected units have less impact on the system dynamics as compared to intermediately connected units. In an equilibrium setting, the hubs are often found to dictate the long-term behaviour. However, we find both analytically and experimentally that the instantaneous states of these units have a short-lasting effect on the state trajectory of the entire system. We present qualitative evidence of this phenomenon from empirical findings about a social network of product recommendations, a protein-protein interaction network, and a neural network, suggesting that it might indeed be a widespread property in nature.

010       Discovering Network Structure Beyond Communities
021       To understand the formation, evolution, and function of complex systems, it is crucial to understand the internal organization of their interaction networks. 
020       Partly due to the impossibility of visualizing large complex networks, resolving network structure remains a challenging problem. Here we overcome this difficulty by combining the visual pattern recognition ability of humans with the high processing speed of computers to develop an exploratory method for discovering groups of nodes characterized by common network properties, including but not limited to communities of densely connected nodes. Without any prior information about the nature of the groups, the method simultaneously identifies the number of groups, the group assignment, and the properties that define these groups. The results of applying our method to real networks suggest the possibility that most group structures lurk undiscovered in the fast-growing inventory of social, biological, and technological networks of scientific interest.

010       Controlling Communication Field of Complex Networks by Transformation   Method
021       Controlling the global statuses of a network by its local dynamic parameters is an important issue, and it is difficult to obtain the direct solution for. 
020       The transformation method, which is originally used to control physical field by designing material parameters, is proposed to obtain the necessary local dynamic parameters when the global statuses of a network system are prescribed in a space. The feasibility of this transformation method is demonstrated and verified by two examples (a communication field cloak and a communication field bender) in the network system. It is shown that the global system state can be controlled by adjusting the local nodes dynamics with the transformation method. Simulation results also show that the transformation method provides a powerful, intuitive and direct way for the global statuses controlling of network systems.

010       Quantifying the dynamics of coupled networks of switches and oscillators
021       Complex network dynamics have been analyzed with models of systems of coupled switches or systems of coupled oscillators. 
020       However, many complex systems are composed of components with diverse dynamics whose interactions drive the system's evolution. We, therefore, introduce a new modeling framework that describes the dynamics of networks composed of both oscillators and switches. Both oscillator synchronization and switch stability are preserved in these heterogeneous, coupled networks. Furthermore, this model recapitulates the qualitative dynamics for the yeast cell cycle consistent with the hypothesized dynamics resulting from decomposition of the regulatory network into dynamic motifs. Introducing feedback into the cell-cycle network induces qualitative dynamics analogous to limitless replicative potential that is a hallmark of cancer. As a result, the proposed model of switch and oscillator coupling provides the ability to incorporate mechanisms that underlie the synchronized stimulus response ubiquitous in biochemical systems.

010       Immunization for complex network based on the effective degree of vertex
021       The basic idea of many effective immunization strategies is first to rank the importance of vertices according to the degrees of vertices and then remove the vertices from highest importance to lowest until the network becomes disconnected. 
020       Here we define the effective degrees of vertex, i.e., the number of its connections linking to un-immunized nodes in current network during the immunization procedure, to rank the importance of vertex, and modify these strategies by using the effective degrees of vertices. Simulations on both the scale-free network models with various degree correlations and two real networks have revealed that the immunization strategies based on the effective degrees are often more effective than those based on the degrees in the initial network.

010       Publish-Subscribe Systems via Gossip: a Study based on Complex Networks
021       This paper analyzes the adoption of unstructured P2P overlay networks to build publish-subscribe systems. 
020       We consider a very simple distributed communication protocol, based on gossip and on the local knowledge each node has about subscriptions made by its neighbours. In particular, upon reception (or generation) of a novel event, a node sends it to those neighbours whose subscriptions match that event. Moreover, the node gossips the event to its "non-interested" neighbours, so that the event can be spread through the overlay. A mathematical analysis is provided to estimate the number of nodes receiving the event, based on the network topology, the amount of subscribers and the gossip probability. These outcomes are compared to those obtained via simulation. Results show even when the amount of subscribers represents a very small (yet non-negligible) portion of network nodes, by tuning the gossip probability the event can percolate through the overlay. Hence, the use of unstructured networks. coupled with simple dissemination protocols, represents a viable approach to build peer-to-peer publish-subscribe applications.

010       Spectral Design of Dynamic Networks via Local Operations
021       Motivated by the relationship between the eigenvalue spectrum of the Laplacian matrix of a network and the behavior of dynamical processes evolving in it, we propose a distributed iterative algorithm in which a group of $n$ autonomous agents self-organize the structure of their communication network in order to control the network's eigenvalue spectrum. 
020       In our algorithm, we assume that each agent has access only to a local (myopic) view of the network around it. In each iteration, agents in the network peform a decentralized decision process to determine the edge addition/deletion that minimizes a distance function defined in the space of eigenvalue spectra. This spectral distance presents interesting theoretical properties that allow an efficient distributed implementation of the decision process. Our iterative algorithm is stable by construction, i.e., locally optimizes the network's eigenvalue spectrum, and is shown to perform extremely well in practice. We illustrate our results with nontrivial simulations in which we design networks matching the spectral properties of complex networks, such as small-world and power-law networks.

010       Information dynamics algorithm for detecting communities in networks
021       The problem of community detection is relevant in many scientific disciplines, from social science to statistical physics. 
020       Given the impact of community detection in many areas, such as psychology and social sciences, we have addressed the issue of modifying existing well performing algorithms by incorporating elements of the domain application fields, i.e. domain-inspired. We have focused on a psychology and social network - inspired approach which may be useful for further strengthening the link between social network studies and mathematics of community detection. Here we introduce a community-detection algorithm derived from the van Dongen's Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL) method by considering networks' nodes as agents capable to take decisions. In this framework we have introduced a memory factor to mimic a typical human behavior such as the oblivion effect. The method is based on information diffusion and it includes a non-linear processing phase. We test our method on two classical community benchmark and on computer generated networks with known community structure. Our approach has three important features: the capacity of detecting overlapping communities, the capability of identifying communities from an individual point of view and the fine tuning the community detectability with respect to prior knowledge of the data. Finally we discuss how to use a Shannon entropy measure for parameter estimation in complex networks.

010       Extreme events and event size fluctuations in biased random walks on   networks
021       Random walk on discrete lattice models is important to understand various types of transport processes. 
020       The extreme events, defined as exceedences of the flux of walkers above a prescribed threshold, have been studied recently in the context of complex networks. This was motivated by the occurrence of rare events such as traffic jams, floods, and power black-outs which take place on networks. In this work, we study extreme events in a generalized random walk model in which the walk is preferentially biased by the network topology. The walkers preferentially choose to hop toward the hubs or small degree nodes. In this setting, we show that extremely large fluctuations in event-sizes are possible on small degree nodes when the walkers are biased toward the hubs. In particular, we obtain the distribution of event-sizes on the network. Further, the probability for the occurrence of extreme events on any node in the network depends on its 'generalized strength', a measure of the ability of a node to attract walkers. The 'generalized strength' is a function of the degree of the node and that of its nearest neighbors. We obtain analytical and simulation results for the probability of occurrence of extreme events on the nodes of a network using a generalized random walk model. The result reveals that the nodes with a larger value of 'generalized strength', on average, display lower probability for the occurrence of extreme events compared to the nodes with lower values of 'generalized strength'.

010       Absence of influential spreaders in rumor dynamics
021       Recent research [1] has suggested that coreness, and not degree, constitutes a better topological descriptor to identifying influential spreaders in complex networks. 
020       This hypothesis has been verified in the context of disease spreading. Here, we instead focus on rumor spreading models, which are more suited for social contagion and information propagation. To this end, we perform extensive computer simulations on top of several real-world networks and find opposite results. Namely, we show that the spreading capabilities of the nodes do not depend on their $k$-core index, which instead determines whether or not a given node prevents the diffusion of a rumor to a system-wide scale. Our findings are relevant both for sociological studies of contagious dynamics and for the design of efficient commercial viral processes.

010       Spatial correlations in attribute communities
021       Community detection is an important tool for exploring and classifying the properties of large complex networks and should be of great help for spatial networks. 
020       Indeed, in addition to their location, nodes in spatial networks can have attributes such as the language for individuals, or any other socio-economical feature that we would like to identify in communities. We discuss in this paper a crucial aspect which was not considered in previous studies which is the possible existence of correlations between space and attributes. Introducing a simple toy model in which both space and node attributes are considered, we discuss the effect of space-attribute correlations on the results of various community detection methods proposed for spatial networks in this paper and in previous studies. When space is irrelevant, our model is equivalent to the stochastic block model which has been shown to display a detectability-non detectability transition. In the regime where space dominates the link formation process, most methods can fail to recover the communities, an effect which is particularly marked when space-attributes correlations are strong. In this latter case, community detection methods which remove the spatial component of the network can miss a large part of the community structure and can lead to incorrect results.

010       Discovering universal statistical laws of complex networks
021       Different network models have been suggested for the topology underlying complex interactions in natural systems. 
020       These models are aimed at replicating specific statistical features encountered in real-world networks. However, it is rarely considered to which degree the results obtained for one particular network class can be extrapolated to real-world networks. We address this issue by comparing different classical and more recently developed network models with respect to their generalisation power, which we identify with large structural variability and absence of constraints imposed by the construction scheme. After having identified the most variable networks, we address the issue of which constraints are common to all network classes and are thus suitable candidates for being generic statistical laws of complex networks. In fact, we find that generic, not model-related dependencies between different network characteristics do exist. This allows, for instance, to infer global features from local ones using regression models trained on networks with high generalisation power. Our results confirm and extend previous findings regarding the synchronisation properties of neural networks. Our method seems especially relevant for large networks, which are difficult to map completely, like the neural networks in the brain. The structure of such large networks cannot be fully sampled with the present technology. Our approach provides a method to estimate global properties of under-sampled networks with good approximation. Finally, we demonstrate on three different data sets (C. elegans' neuronal network, R. prowazekii's metabolic network, and a network of synonyms extracted from Roget's Thesaurus) that real-world networks have statistical relations compatible with those obtained using regression models.

010       On Accuracy of Community Structure Discovery Algorithms
021       Community structure discovery in complex networks is a quite challenging problem spanning many applications in various disciplines such as biology, social network and physics. 
020       Emerging from various approaches numerous algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless little attention has been devoted to compare their efficiency on realistic simulated data. To better understand their relative performances, we evaluate systematically eleven algorithms covering the main approaches. The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) measure is used to assess the quality of the discovered community structure from controlled artificial networks with realistic topological properties. Results show that along with the network size, the average proportion of intra-community to inter-community links is the most influential parameter on performances. Overall, "Infomap" is the leading algorithm, followed by "Walktrap", "SpinGlass" and "Louvain" which also achieve good consistency.

010       Intermittent social distancing strategy for epidemic control
021       We study the critical effect of an intermittent social distancing strategy on the propagation of epidemics in adaptive complex networks. 
020       We characterize the effect of our strategy in the framework of the susceptible-infected-recovered model. In our model, based on local information, a susceptible individual interrupts the contact with an infected individual with a probability $\sigma$ and restores it after a fixed time $t_{b}$. We find that, depending on the network topology, in our social distancing strategy there exists a cutoff threshold $\sigma_{c}$ beyond which the epidemic phase disappears. Our results are supported by a theoretical framework and extensive simulations of the model. Furthermore we show that this strategy is very efficient because it leads to a "susceptible herd behavior" that protects a large fraction of susceptibles individuals. We explain our results using percolation arguments.

010       Rare region effects in the contact process on networks
021       Networks and dynamical processes occurring on them have become a paradigmatic representation of complex systems. 
020       Studying the role of quenched disorder, both intrinsic to nodes and topological, is a key challenge. With this in mind, here we analyse the contact process, i.e. the simplest model for propagation phenomena, with node-dependent infection rates (i.e. intrinsic quenched disorder) on complex networks. We find Griffiths phases and other rare region effects, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic, logarithmic, etc.) relaxation, on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. We predict similar effects to exist for other topologies as long as a non-vanishing percolation threshold exists. More strikingly, we find that Griffiths phases can also emerge --even with constant epidemic rates-- as a consequence of mere topological heterogeneity. In particular, we find Griffiths phases in finite dimensional networks as, for instance, a family of generalized small-world networks. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation phenomena and other dynamical processes on networks, and are relevant for the analysis of both models and empirical data.

010       Multi-confocal Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy : experimental   demonstration and potential applications for living cell measurements
021       We report, for the first time, a multi-confocal Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (mFCS) technique which allows parallel measurements at different locations, by combining a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM), with an Electron Multiplying-CCD camera (EM-CCD). 
020       The SLM is used to produce a series of laser spots, while the pixels of the EM-CCD play the roles of virtual pinholes. The phase map addressed to the SLM is calculated by using the spherical wave approximation and makes it possible to produce several diffraction limited laser spots, either aligned or spread over the field of view. To attain fast enough imaging rates, the camera has been used in different acquisition modes, the fastest of which leads to a time resolution of 100 $\mu$s. We qualified the experimental set-up by using solutions of sulforhodamine G in glycerol and demonstrated that the observation volumes are similar to that of a standard confocal set-up. To demonstrate that our mFCS method is suitable for intracellular studies, experiments have been conducted on two stable cell lines: mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing eGFP-actin and H1299 cells expressing the heat shock factor fusion protein HSF1-eGFP. In the first case we could recover, by analyzing the auto-correlation curves, the diffusion constant of G-actin within the cytoplasm, although we were also sensitive to the complex network of interactions with F-actin. Concerning HSF1, we could clearly observe the modifications of the number of molecules and of the HSF1 dynamics during heat shock.

010       Onset of Synchronization in Complex Networks of Noisy Oscillators
021       We study networks of noisy phase oscillators whose nodes are characterized by a random degree counting the number of its connections. 
020       Both these degrees and the natural frequencies of the oscillators are distributed according to a given probability density. Replacing the randomly connected network by an all-to-all coupled network with weighted edges, allows us to formulate the dynamics of a single oscillator coupled to the mean field and to derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. From the latter we calculate the critical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization as a function of the noise intensity, the frequency distribution and the first two moments of the degree distribution. Our approach is applied to a dense small-world network model, for which we calculate the degree distribution. Numerical simulations prove the validity of the made replacement. We also test the applicability to more sparsely connected networks and formulate homogeneity and absence of correlations in the degree distribution as limiting factors of our approach.

010       Effects of fear factors in disease propagation
021       Upon an outbreak of a dangerous infectious disease, people generally tend to reduce their contacts with others in fear of getting infected. 
020       Such typical actions apparently help slow down the spreading of infection. Thanks to today's broad public media coverage, the fear factor may even contribute to prevent an outbreak from happening. We are motivated to study such effects by adopting a complex network approach. Firstly we evaluate the simple case where connections between individuals are randomly removed due to fear factor. Then we consider a different case where each individual keeps at least a few connections after contact reduction. Such a case is arguably more realistic since people may choose to keep a few social contacts, e.g., with their family members and closest friends, at any cost. Finally a study is conducted on the case where connection removals are carried out dynamically while the infection is spreading out. Analytical and simulation results show that the fear factor may not easily prevent an epidemic outbreak from happening in scale-free networks. However, it significantly reduces the fraction of the nodes ever getting infected during the outbreak.

010       Transmission of Information between Complex Networks: 1/f-Resonance
021       We study the transport of information between two complex networks with similar properties. 
020       Both networks generate non-Poisson renewal fluctuations with a power-law spectrum 1/f^(3-\mu), the case \mu= 2 corresponding to ideal 1/f-noise. We denote by \mu_S and \mu_P the power-law indexes of the network "system" of interest S and the perturbing network P respectively. By adopting a generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) we show that the ideal condition of 1/f-noise for both networks corresponds to maximal information transport. We prove that to make the network S respond when \mu_S &lt; 2 we have to set the condition \mu_P &lt; 2. In the latter case, if \mu_P &lt; \mu_S, the system S inherits the relaxation properties of the perturbing network. In the case where \mu_P &gt; 2, no response and no information transmission occurs in the long-time limit. We consider two possible generalizations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and show that both lead to maximal information transport in the condition of 1/f-noise.

010       Delay-enhanced coherent chaotic oscillations in networks with large   disorders
021       We study the effect of coupling delay in a regular network with a ring topology and in a more complex network with an all-to-all (global) topology in the presence of impurities (disorder). 
020       We find that the coupling delay is capable of inducing phase-coherent chaotic oscillations in both types of networks, thereby enhancing the spatiotemporal complexity even in the presence of 50% of symmetric disorders of both fixed and random types. Furthermore, the coupling delay increases the robustness of the networks up to 70% of disorders, thereby preventing the network from acquiring periodic oscillations to foster disorder-induced spatiotemporal order. We also confirm the enhancement of coherent chaotic oscillations using snapshots of the phases and values of the associated Kuramoto order parameter. We also explain a possible mechanism for the phenomenon of delay-induced coherent chaotic oscillations despite the presence of large disorders and discuss its applications.

010       Complex network classification using partially self-avoiding   deterministic walks
021       Complex networks have attracted increasing interest from various fields of science. 
020       It has been demonstrated that each complex network model presents specific topological structures which characterize its connectivity and dynamics. Complex network classification rely on the use of representative measurements that model topological structures. Although there are a large number of measurements, most of them are correlated. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new measurement for complex network classification based on partially self-avoiding walks. We validate the measurement on a data set composed by 40.000 complex networks of four well-known models. Our results indicate that the proposed measurement improves correct classification of networks compared to the traditional ones.

010       Controlling edge dynamics in complex networks
021       The interaction of distinct units in physical, social, biological and technological systems naturally gives rise to complex network structures. 
020       Networks have constantly been in the focus of research for the last decade, with considerable advances in the description of their structural and dynamical properties. However, much less effort has been devoted to studying the controllability of the dynamics taking place on them. Here we introduce and evaluate a dynamical process defined on the edges of a network, and demonstrate that the controllability properties of this process significantly differ from simple nodal dynamics. Evaluation of real-world networks indicates that most of them are more controllable than their randomized counterparts. We also find that transcriptional regulatory networks are particularly easy to control. Analytic calculations show that networks with scale-free degree distributions have better controllability properties than uncorrelated networks, and positively correlated in- and out-degrees enhance the controllability of the proposed dynamics.

010       Comparing intermittency and network measurements of words and their   dependency on authorship
021       Many features from texts and languages can now be inferred from statistical analyses using concepts from complex networks and dynamical systems. 
020       In this paper we quantify how topological properties of word co-occurrence networks and intermittency (or burstiness) in word distribution depend on the style of authors. Our database contains 40 books from 8 authors who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, for which the following network measurements were obtained: clustering coefficient, average shortest path lengths, and betweenness. We found that the two factors with stronger dependency on the authors were the skewness in the distribution of word intermittency and the average shortest paths. Other factors such as the betweeness and the Zipf's law exponent show only weak dependency on authorship. Also assessed was the contribution from each measurement to authorship recognition using three machine learning methods. The best performance was a ca. 65 % accuracy upon combining complex network and intermittency features with the nearest neighbor algorithm. From a detailed analysis of the interdependence of the various metrics it is concluded that the methods used here are complementary for providing short- and long-scale perspectives of texts, which are useful for applications such as identification of topical words and information retrieval.

010       On the relationship between the theory of cointegration and the theory   of phase synchronization
021       The theory of cointegration has been the leading theory in econometrics with powerful applications to macroeconomics during the last decades. 
020       On the other hand the theory of phase synchronization for weakly coupled complex oscillators has been one of the leading theories in physics for some 15 years with many applications to different areas of science. For example in neuroscience phase synchronization is regarded as essential for functional coupling of different brain regions. In an abstract sense both theories describe the dynamic fluctuation around some equilibrium. In this paper we point out that there exists a very close connection between both theories. We show that there exists a system of stochastic difference equations which can be viewed as close to the Kuramoto equations, whose solution is a cointegrated system. As one consequence the rich theory on statistical inference for cointegrated systems can immediately be applied for statistical inference on phase synchronization based on empirical data. This includes tests for phase synchronization, tests for unidirectional coupling and the identification of the equilibrium from data including phase shifts. We give an example where an unidirectionally coupled Roessler-Lorenz system is identified with the methods from cointegration. The methods from cointegration may also be used to investigate phase synchronization in complex networks. On the contrary there are many interesting results on phase synchronization which may inspire new research on cointegration.

010       Communities and bottlenecks: Trees and treelike networks have high   modularity
021       Much effort has gone into understanding the modular nature of complex networks. 
020       Communities, also known as clusters or modules, are typically considered to be densely interconnected groups of nodes that are only sparsely connected to other groups in the network. Discovering high quality communities is a difficult and important problem in a number of areas. The most popular approach is the objective function known as modularity, used both to discover communities and to measure their strength. To understand the modular structure of networks it is then crucial to know how such functions evaluate different topologies, what features they account for, and what implicit assumptions they may make. We show that trees and treelike networks can have unexpectedly and often arbitrarily high values of modularity. This is surprising since trees are maximally sparse connected graphs and are not typically considered to possess modular structure, yet the nonlocal null model used by modularity assigns low probabilities, and thus high significance, to the densities of these sparse tree communities. We further study the practical performance of popular methods on model trees and on a genealogical data set and find that the discovered communities also have very high modularity, often approaching its maximum value. Statistical tests reveal the communities in trees to be significant, in contrast with known results for partitions of sparse, random graphs.

020       We form directed and weighted networks of teams and also of their captains. The success of a team (or captain) is determined by the 'quality' of wins and not on the number of wins alone. We apply the diffusion based PageRank algorithm on the networks to access the importance of wins and rank the teams and captains respectively. Our analysis identifies {\it Australia} as the best team in both forms of cricket $-$ Test and ODI. {\it Steve Waugh} is identified as the best captain in Test cricket and {\it Ricky Ponting} is the best captain in the ODI format. We also compare our ranking scheme with the existing ranking schemes which include the Reliance ICC Ranking. Our method does not depend on `external' criteria in ranking of teams (captains). The purpose of this paper is to introduce a revised ranking of cricket teams and to quantify the success of the captains.

010       Hierarchical multiresolution method to overcome the resolution limit in   complex networks
021       The analysis of the modular structure of networks is a major challenge in complex networks theory. 
020       The validity of the modular structure obtained is essential to confront the problem of the topology-functionality relationship. Recently, several authors have worked on the limit of resolution that different community detection algorithms have, making impossible the detection of natural modules when very different topological scales coexist in the network. Existing multiresolution methods are not the panacea for solving the problem in extreme situations, and also fail. Here, we present a new hierarchical multiresolution scheme that works even when the network decomposition is very close to the resolution limit. The idea is to split the multiresolution method for optimal subgraphs of the network, focusing the analysis on each part independently. We also propose a new algorithm to speed up the computational cost of screening the mesoscale looking for the resolution parameter that best splits every subgraph. The hierarchical algorithm is able to solve a difficult benchmark proposed in [Lancichinetti &amp; Fortunato, 2011], encouraging the further analysis of hierarchical methods based on the modularity quality function.

021       During the last few years, much research has been devoted to strategic interactions on complex networks. 
020       In this context, the Prisoner's Dilemma has become a paradigmatic model, and it has been established that imitative evolutionary dynamics lead to very different outcomes depending on the details of the network. We here report that when one takes into account the real behavior of people observed in the experiments, both at the mean-field level and on utterly different networks the observed level of cooperation is the same. We thus show that when human subjects interact in an heterogeneous mix including cooperators, defectors and moody conditional cooperators, the structure of the population does not promote or inhibit cooperation with respect to a well mixed population.

010       Organic Design of Massively Distributed Systems: A Complex Networks   Perspective
021       The vision of Organic Computing addresses challenges that arise in the design of future information systems that are comprised of numerous, heterogeneous, resource-constrained and error-prone components or devices. 
020       Here, the notion organic particularly highlights the idea that, in order to be manageable, such systems should exhibit self-organization, self-adaptation and self-healing characteristics similar to those of biological systems. In recent years, the principles underlying many of the interesting characteristics of natural systems have been investigated from the perspective of complex systems science, particularly using the conceptual framework of statistical physics and statistical mechanics. In this article, we review some of the interesting relations between statistical physics and networked systems and discuss applications in the engineering of organic networked computing systems with predictable, quantifiable and controllable self-* properties.

010       A Network Perspective on Software Modularity
021       Modularity is a desirable characteristic for software systems. 
020       In this article we propose to use a quantitative method from complex network sciences to estimate the coherence between the modularity of the dependency network of large open source Java projects and their decomposition in terms of Java packages. The results presented in this article indicate that our methodology offers a promising and reasonable quantitative approach with potential impact on software engineering processes.

010       Bond percolation on a class of correlated and clustered random graphs
021       We introduce a formalism for computing bond percolation properties of a class of correlated and clustered random graphs. 
020       This class of graphs is a generalization of the Configuration Model where nodes of different types are connected via different types of hyperedges, edges that can link more than 2 nodes. We argue that the multitype approach coupled with the use of clustered hyperedges can reproduce a wide spectrum of complex patterns, and thus enhances our capability to model real complex networks. As an illustration of this claim, we use our formalism to highlight unusual behaviors of the size and composition of the components (small and giant) in a synthetic, albeit realistic, social network.

010       Nodal domain partition and the number of communities in networks
021       It is difficult to detect and evaluate the number of communities in complex networks, especially when the situation involves with an ambiguous boundary between the inner- and inter-community densities. 
020       In this paper, Discrete Nodal Domain Theory could be used to provide a criterion to determine how many communities a network would have and how to partition these communities by means of the topological structure and geometric characterization. By capturing the signs of certain Laplacian eigenvectors we can separate the network into several reasonable clusters. The method leads to a fast and effective algorithm with application to a variety of real networks data sets.

010       Supercooperation in Evolutionary Games on Correlated Weighted Networks
021       In this work we study the behavior of classical two-person, two-strategies evolutionary games on a class of weighted networks derived from Barab\'asi-Albert and random scale-free unweighted graphs. 
020       Using customary imitative dynamics, our numerical simulation results show that the presence of link weights that are correlated in a particular manner with the degree of the link endpoints, leads to unprecedented levels of cooperation in the whole games' phase space, well above those found for the corresponding unweighted complex networks. We provide intuitive explanations for this favorable behavior by transforming the weighted networks into unweighted ones with particular topological properties. The resulting structures help to understand why cooperation can thrive and also give ideas as to how such supercooperative networks might be built.

010       Is the immune network a complex network?
021       Some years ago a cellular automata model was proposed to describe the evolution of the immune repertoire of B cells and antibodies based on Jerne's immune network theory and shape-space formalism. 
020       Here we investigate if the networks generated by this model in the different regimes can be classified as complex networks. We have found that in the chaotic regime the network has random characteristics with large, constant values of clustering coefficients, while in the ordered phase, the degree distribution of the network is exponential and the clustering coefficient exhibits power law behavior. In the transition region we observed a mixed behavior (random-like and exponential) of the degree distribution as opposed to the scale-free behavior reported for other biological networks. Randomness and low connectivity in the active sites allow for rapid changes in the connectivity distribution of the immune network in order to include and/or discard information and generate a dynamic memory. However it is the availability of the low concentration nodes to change rapidly without driving the system to pathological states that allow the generation of dynamic memory and consequently a reproduction of immune system behavior in mice. Although the overall behavior of degree correlation is positive, there is an interplay between assortative and disassortative mixing in the stable and transition regions regulated by a threshold value of the node degree, which achieves a maximum value on the transition region and becomes totally assortative in the chaotic regime.

010       Predicting epidemic outbreak from individual features of the spreaders
021       Knowing which individuals can be more efficient in spreading a pathogen throughout a determinate environment is a fundamental question in disease control. 
020       Indeed, over the last years the spread of epidemic diseases and its relationship with the topology of the involved system have been a recurrent topic in complex network theory, taking into account both network models and real-world data. In this paper we explore possible correlations between the heterogeneous spread of an epidemic disease governed by the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, and several attributes of the originating vertices, considering Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER), Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) and random geometric graphs (RGG), as well as a real case of study, the US Air Transportation Network that comprises the US 500 busiest airports along with inter-connections. Initially, the heterogeneity of the spreading is achieved considering the RGG networks, in which we analytically derive an expression for the distribution of the spreading rates among the established contacts, by assuming that such rates decay exponentially with the distance that separates the individuals. Such distribution is also considered for the ER and BA models, where we observe topological effects on the correlations. In the case of the airport network, the spreading rates are empirically defined, assumed to be directly proportional to the seat availability. Among both the theoretical and the real networks considered, we observe a high correlation between the total epidemic prevalence and the degree, as well as the strength and the accessibility of the epidemic sources. For attributes such as the betweenness centrality and the $k$-shell index, however, the correlation depends on the topology considered.

010       Hierarchy measure for complex networks
021       Nature, technology and society are full of complexity arising from the intricate web of the interactions among the units of the related systems (e.g., proteins, computers, people). 
020       Consequently, one of the most successful recent approaches to capturing the fundamental features of the structure and dynamics of complex systems has been the investigation of the networks associated with the above units (nodes) together with their relations (edges). Most complex systems have an inherently hierarchical organization and, correspondingly, the networks behind them also exhibit hierarchical features. Indeed, several papers have been devoted to describing this essential aspect of networks, however, without resulting in a widely accepted, converging concept concerning the quantitative characterization of the level of their hierarchy. Here we develop an approach and propose a quantity (measure) which is simple enough to be widely applicable, reveals a number of universal features of the organization of real-world networks and, as we demonstrate, is capable of capturing the essential features of the structure and the degree of hierarchy in a complex network. The measure we introduce is based on a generalization of the m-reach centrality, which we first extend to directed/partially directed graphs. Then, we define the global reaching centrality (GRC), which is the difference between the maximum and the average value of the generalized reach centralities over the network. We investigate the behavior of the GRC considering both a synthetic model with an adjustable level of hierarchy and real networks. Results for real networks show that our hierarchy measure is related to the controllability of the given system. We also propose a visualization procedure for large complex networks that can be used to obtain an overall qualitative picture about the nature of their hierarchical structure.

010       Global modeling of transcriptional responses in interaction networks
021       Motivation: Cell-biological processes are regulated through a complex network of interactions between genes and their products. 
020       The processes, their activating conditions, and the associated transcriptional responses are often unknown. Organism-wide modeling of network activation can reveal unique and shared mechanisms between physiological conditions, and potentially as yet unknown processes. We introduce a novel approach for organism-wide discovery and analysis of transcriptional responses in interaction networks. The method searches for local, connected regions in a network that exhibit coordinated transcriptional response in a subset of conditions. Known interactions between genes are used to limit the search space and to guide the analysis. Validation on a human pathway network reveals physiologically coherent responses, functional relatedness between physiological conditions, and coordinated, context-specific regulation of the genes.

010       Influence of Topological Features on Spatially-Structured Evolutionary   Algorithms Dynamics
021       In the last decades, complex networks theory significantly influenced other disciplines on the modeling of both static and dynamic aspects of systems observed in nature. 
020       This work aims to investigate the effects of networks' topological features on the dynamics of an evolutionary algorithm, considering in particular the ability to find a large number of optima on multi-modal problems. We introduce a novel spatially-structured evolutionary algorithm and we apply it on two combinatorial problems: ONEMAX and the multi-modal NMAX. Considering three different network models we investigate the relationships between their features, algorithm's convergence and its ability to find multiple optima (for the multi-modal problem). In order to perform a deeper analysis we investigate the introduction of weighted graphs with time-varying weights. The results show that networks with a large Average Path Length lead to an higher number of optima and a consequent slow exploration dynamics (i.e. low First Hitting Time). Furthermore, the introduction of weighted networks shows the possibility to tune algorithm's dynamics during its execution with the parameter related with weights' change. This work gives a first answer about the effects of various graph topologies on the diversity of evolutionary algorithms and it describes a simple but powerful algorithmic framework which allows to investigate many aspects of ssEAs dynamics.

021       We discuss three different aspects of the quantum dynamics of bio-molecular systems and more generally complex networks in the presence of strongly coupled environments. 
020       Firstly, we make a case for the systematic study of fundamental structural elements underlying the quantum dynamics of these systems, identify such elements and explore the resulting interplay of quantum dynamics and environmental decoherence. Secondly, we critically examine some existing approaches to the numerical description of system-environment interaction in the non-perturbative regime and present a promising new method that can overcome some limitations of existing methods. Thirdly, we present an approach towards deciding and quantifying the non-classicality of the action of the environment and the observed system-dynamics. We stress the relevance of these tools for strengthening the interplay between theoretical and experimental research in this field.

010       Effects of time window size and placement on the structure of aggregated   networks
021       Complex networks are often constructed by aggregating empirical data over time, such that a link represents the existence of interactions between the endpoint nodes and the link weight represents the intensity of such interactions within the aggregation time window. 
020       The resulting networks are then often considered static. More often than not, the aggregation time window is dictated by the availability of data, and the effects of its length on the resulting networks are rarely considered. Here, we address this question by studying the structural features of networks emerging from aggregating empirical data over different time intervals, focussing on networks derived from time-stamped, anonymized mobile telephone call records. Our results show that short aggregation intervals yield networks where strong links associated with dense clusters dominate; the seeds of such clusters or communities become already visible for intervals of around one week. The degree and weight distributions are seen to become stationary around a few days and a few weeks, respectively. An aggregation interval of around 30 days results in the stablest similar networks when consecutive windows are compared. For longer intervals, the effects of weak or random links become increasingly stronger, and the average degree of the network keeps growing even for intervals up to 180 days. The placement of the time window is also seen to affect the outcome: for short windows, different behavioural patterns play a role during weekends and weekdays, and for longer windows it is seen that networks aggregated during holiday periods are significantly different.

010       FastSIR Algorithm: A Fast Algorithm for simulation of epidemic spread in   large networks by using SIR compartment model
021       The epidemic spreading on arbitrary complex networks is studied in SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovered) compartment model. 
020       We propose our implementation of a Naive SIR algorithm for epidemic simulation spreading on networks that uses data structures efficiently to reduce running time. The Naive SIR algorithm models full epidemic dynamics and can be easily upgraded to parallel version. We also propose novel algorithm for epidemic simulation spreading on networks called the FastSIR algorithm that has better average case running time than the Naive SIR algorithm. The FastSIR algorithm uses novel approach to reduce average case running time by constant factor by using probability distributions of the number of infected nodes. Moreover, the FastSIR algorithm does not follow epidemic dynamics in time, but still captures all infection transfers. Furthermore, we also propose an efficient recursive method for calculating probability distributions of the number of infected nodes. Average case running time of both algorithms has also been derived and experimental analysis was made on five different empirical complex networks.

010       An Intelligent Mobile-Agent Based Scalable Network Management   Architecture for Large-Scale Enterprise System
021       Several Mobile Agent based distributed network management models have been proposed in recent times to address the scalability and flexibility problems of centralized (SNMP or CMIP management models) models. 
020       Though the use of Mobile Agents to distribute and delegate management tasks comes handy in dealing with the previously stated issues, many of the agent-based management frameworks like initial flat bed models and static mid-level managers employing mobile agents models cannot efficiently meet the demands of current networks which are growing in size and complexity. Moreover, varied technologies, such as SONET, ATM, Ethernet, DWDM etc., present at different layers of the Access, Metro and Core (long haul) sections of the network, have contributed to the complexity in terms of their own framing and protocol structures. Thus, controlling and managing the traffic in these networks is a challenging task. This paper presents an intelligent scalable hierarchical agent based model for the management of large-scale complex networks to address aforesaid issues. The cost estimation, carried out with a view to compute the overall management cost in terms of management data overhead, is being presented. The results obtained thereafter establish the usefulness of the presented architecture as compare to centralized and flat bed agent based models.

010       On dynamic network entropy in cancer
021       The cellular phenotype is described by a complex network of molecular interactions. 
020       Elucidating network properties that distinguish disease from the healthy cellular state is therefore of critical importance for gaining systems-level insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately for developing improved therapies. By integrating gene expression data with a protein interaction network to induce a stochastic dynamics on the network, we here demonstrate that cancer cells are characterised by an increase in the dynamic network entropy, compared to cells of normal physiology. Using a fundamental relation between the macroscopic resilience of a dynamical system and the uncertainty (entropy) in the underlying microscopic processes, we argue that cancer cells will be more robust to random gene perturbations. In addition, we formally demonstrate that gene expression differences between normal and cancer tissue are anticorrelated with local dynamic entropy changes, thus providing a systemic link between gene expression changes at the nodes and their local network dynamics. In particular, we also find that genes which drive cell-proliferation in cancer cells and which often encode oncogenes are associated with reductions in the dynamic network entropy. In summary, our results support the view that the observed increased robustness of cancer cells to perturbation and therapy may be due to an increase in the dynamic network entropy that allows cells to adapt to the new cellular stresses. Conversely, genes that exhibit local flux entropy decreases in cancer may render cancer cells more susceptible to targeted intervention and may therefore represent promising drug targets.

010       Conservative model for synchronization problems in complex networks
021       In this paper we study the scaling behavior of the interface fluctuations (roughness) for a discrete model with conservative noise on complex networks. 
020       Conservative noise is a noise which has no external flux of deposition on the surface and the whole process is due to the diffusion. It was found that in Euclidean lattices the roughness of the steady state $W_s$ does not depend on the system size. Here, we find that for Scale-Free networks of $N$ nodes, characterized by a degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, $W_s$ is independent of $N$ for any $\lambda$. This behavior is very different than the one found by Pastore y Piontti {\it et. al} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 046117 (2007)] for a discrete model with non-conservative noise, that implies an external flux, where $W_s \sim \ln N$ for $\lambda &lt; 3$, and was explained by non-linear terms in the analytical evolution equation for the interface [La Rocca {\it et. al}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 77}, 046120 (2008)]. In this work we show that in this processes with conservative noise the non-linear terms are not relevant to describe the scaling behavior of $W_s$.

010       Clustering assortativity, communities and functional modules in   real-world networks
021       Complex networks of real-world systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena, producing structures far from regular or random. 
020       Clustering, community structure and assortative mixing by degree are perhaps among most prominent examples of the latter. Although generally accepted for social networks, these properties only partially explain the structure of other networks. We first show that degree-corrected clustering is in contrast to standard definition highly assortative. Yet interesting on its own, we further note that non-social networks contain connected regions with very low clustering. Hence, the structure of real-world networks is beyond communities. We here investigate the concept of functional modules---groups of regularly equivalent nodes---and show that such structures could explain for the properties observed in non-social networks. Real-world networks might be composed of functional modules that are overlaid by communities. We support the latter by proposing a simple network model that generates scale-free small-world networks with tunable clustering and degree mixing. Model has a natural interpretation in many real-world networks, while it also gives insights into an adequate community extraction framework. We also present an algorithm for detection of arbitrary structural modules without any prior knowledge. Algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art, while application to real-world networks reveals well supported composites of different structural modules that are consistent with the underlying systems. Clear functional modules are identified in all types of networks including social. Our findings thus expose functional modules as another key ingredient of complex real-world networks.

010       Quick Detection of Nodes with Large Degrees
021       Our goal is to quickly find top $k$ lists of nodes with the largest degrees in large complex networks. 
020       If the adjacency list of the network is known (not often the case in complex networks), a deterministic algorithm to find a node with the largest degree requires an average complexity of O(n), where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. Even this modest complexity can be very high for large complex networks. We propose to use the random walk based method. We show theoretically and by numerical experiments that for large networks the random walk method finds good quality top lists of nodes with high probability and with computational savings of orders of magnitude. We also propose stopping criteria for the random walk method which requires very little knowledge about the structure of the network.

010       Quantum Navigation and Ranking in Complex Networks
021       Complex networks are formal frameworks capturing the interdependencies between the elements of large systems and databases. 
020       This formalism allows to use network navigation methods to rank the importance that each constituent has on the global organization of the system. A key example is Pagerank navigation which is at the core of the most used search engine of the World Wide Web. Inspired in this classical algorithm, we define a quantum navigation method providing a unique ranking of the elements of a network. We analyze the convergence of quantum navigation to the stationary rank of networks and show that quantumness decreases the number of navigation steps before convergence. In addition, we show that quantum navigation allows to solve degeneracies found in classical ranks. By implementing the quantum algorithm in real networks, we confirm these improvements and show that quantum coherence unveils new hierarchical features about the global organization of complex systems.

010       Epidemic spreading on interconnected networks
021       Many real networks are not isolated from each other but form networks of networks, often interrelated in non trivial ways. 
020       Here, we analyze an epidemic spreading process taking place on top of two interconnected complex networks. We develop a heterogeneous mean field approach that allows us to calculate the conditions for the emergence of an endemic state. Interestingly, a global endemic state may arise in the coupled system even though the epidemics is not able to propagate on each network separately, and even when the number of coupling connections is small. Our analytic results are successfully confronted against large-scale numerical simulations.

010       Nucleation pathways on complex networks
021       Identifying nucleation pathway is important for understanding the kinetics of first-order phase transitions in natural systems. 
020       In the present work, we study nucleation pathway of the Ising model in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks using the forward flux sampling method, and find that the nucleation processes represent distinct features along pathways for different network topologies. For homogeneous networks, there always exists a dominant nucleating cluster to which relatively small clusters are attached gradually to form the critical nucleus. For heterogeneous ones, many small isolated nucleating clusters emerge at the early stage of the nucleation process, until suddenly they form the critical nucleus through a sharp merging process. By analyzing the properties of the nucleating clusters along the pathway, we show that the main reason behind the different routes is the heterogeneous character of the underlying networks.

010       Localization and Spreading of Diseases in Complex Networks
021       Using the SIS model on unweighted and weighted networks, we consider the disease localization phenomenon. 
020       In contrast to the well-recognized point of view that diseases infect a finite fraction of vertices right above the epidemic threshold, we show that diseases can be localized on a finite number of vertices, where hubs and edges with large weights are centers of localization. Our results follow from the analysis of standard models of networks and empirical data for real-world networks.

010       Closed benchmarks for network community structure characterization
021       Characterizing the community structure of complex networks is a key challenge in many scientific fields. 
020       Very diverse algorithms and methods have been proposed to this end, many working reasonably well in specific situations. However, no consensus has emerged on which of these methods is the best to use in practice. In part, this is due to the fact that testing their performance requires the generation of a comprehensive, standard set of synthetic benchmarks, a goal not yet fully achieved. Here, we present a type of benchmark that we call "closed", in which an initial network of known community structure is progressively converted into a second network whose communities are also known. This approach differs from all previously published ones, in which networks evolve toward randomness. The use of this type of benchmark allows us to monitor the transformation of the community structure of a network. Moreover, we can predict the optimal behavior of the variation of information, a measure of the quality of the partitions obtained, at any moment of the process. This enables us in many cases to determine the best partition among those suggested by different algorithms. Also, since any network can be used as a starting point, extensive studies and comparisons can be performed using a heterogeneous set of structures, including random ones. These properties make our benchmarks a general standard for comparing community detection algorithms.

010       Predicting effects of structural stress in a genome-reduced model   bacterial metabolism
021       We studied in silico effects of structural stress in Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a genome-reduced model bacterial organism, by tracking the damage propagating on its metabolic network after a deleterious perturbation. 
020       First, we analyzed failure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and compared the results to those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To alert to the potential damage caused by the failure of individual reactions, we propose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target reactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous failure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong non-linear amplification effects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the intersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene co-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied the consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage caused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between genome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality. At the same time, we found that genes controlling high-damage reactions tend to operate in functional isolation, as a metabolic protection mechanism. We conclude that the architecture of M. pneumoniae, both at the level of metabolism and genome, seems to have evolved towards increased structural robustness, similarly to other more complex model bacterial organisms, despite its reduced genome size and its greater metabolic network linearity. Our approach, although motivated biochemically, is generic enough to be of potential use toward analyzing and predicting spreading of structural stress in any bipartite complex network.

020       We explore the topological properties and community structure of the network. We observe that the Indian Highway Network displays small world properties and is assortative in nature. We also identify the most important road-junctions (or cities) in the highway network based on the betweenness centrality of the node. This could help in identifying the potential congestion points in the network. Our study is of practical importance and could provide a novel approach to reduce congestion and improve the performance of the highway network

010       Epidemic reemergence in adaptive complex networks
021       The dynamic nature of system gives rise to dynamical features of epidemic spreading, such as oscillation and bistability. 
020       In this paper, by studying the epidemic spreading in growing networks, in which susceptible nodes may adaptively break the connections with infected ones yet avoid getting isolated, we reveal a new phenomenon - \emph{epidemic reemergence}, where the number of infected nodes is incubated at a low level for a long time and then bursts up for a short time. The process may repeat several times before the infection finally vanishes. Simulation results show that all the three factors, namely the network growth, the connection breaking and the isolation avoidance, are necessary for epidemic reemergence to happen. We present a simple theoretical analysis to explain the process of reemergence in detail. Our study may offer some useful insights helping explain the phenomenon of repeated epidemic explosions.

010       An efficient strategy to suppress epidemic explosion in heterogeneous   metapopulation networks
021       We propose an efficient strategy to suppress epidemic explosion in heterogeneous metapopulation networks, wherein each node represents a subpopulation with any number of individuals and is assigned a curing rate that is proportional to $k^{\alpha}$ with $k$ the node degree and $\alpha$ an adjustable parameter. 
020       We have performed stochastic simulations of the dynamical reaction-diffusion processes associated with the susceptible-infected-susceptible model in scale-free networks. We found that the epidemic threshold reaches a maximum when the exponent $\alpha$ is tuned to be $\alpha_{opt}\simeq 1.3$. This nontrivial phenomenon is robust to the change of the network size and the average degree. In addition, we have carried out a mean field analysis to further validate our scheme, which also demonstrates that epidemic explosion follows different routes for $\alpha$ larger or less than $\alpha_{opt}$. Our work suggests that in order to effectively suppress epidemic spreading on heterogeneous complex networks, subpopulations with higher degrees should be allocated more resources than just being linearly dependent on the degree $k$.

010       The Evolution of Complex Networks: A New Framework
021       We introduce a new framework for the analysis of the dynamics of networks, based on randomly reinforced urn (RRU) processes, in which the weight of the edges is determined by a reinforcement mechanism. 
020       We rigorously explain the empirical evidence that in many real networks there is a subset of "dominant edges" that control a major share of the total weight of the network. Furthermore, we introduce a new statistical procedure to study the evolution of networks over time, assessing if a given instance of the nework is taken at its steady state or not. Our results are quite general, since they are not based on a particular probability distribution or functional form of the weights. We test our model in the context of the International Trade Network, showing the existence of a core of dominant links and determining its size.

010       Exploring complex networks by means of adaptive walkers
021       Finding efficient algorithms to explore large networks with the aim of recovering information about their structure is an open problem. 
020       Here, we investigate this challenge by proposing a model in which random walkers with previously assigned home nodes navigate through the network during a fixed amount of time. We consider that the exploration is successful if the walker gets the information gathered back home, otherwise, no data is retrieved. Consequently, at each time step, the walkers, with some probability, have the choice to either go backward approaching their home or go farther away. We show that there is an optimal solution to this problem in terms of the average information retrieved and the degree of the home nodes and design an adaptive strategy based on the behavior of the random walker. Finally, we compare different strategies that emerge from the model in the context of network reconstruction. Our results could be useful for the discovery of unknown connections in large scale networks.

010       On the Influence of Informed Agents on Learning and Adaptation over   Networks
021       Adaptive networks consist of a collection of agents with adaptation and learning abilities. 
020       The agents interact with each other on a local level and diffuse information across the network through their collaborations. In this work, we consider two types of agents: informed agents and uninformed agents. The former receive new data regularly and perform consultation and in-network tasks, while the latter do not collect data and only participate in the consultation tasks. We examine the performance of adaptive networks as a function of the proportion of informed agents and their distribution in space. The results reveal some interesting and surprising trade-offs between convergence rate and mean-square performance. In particular, among other results, it is shown that the performance of adaptive networks does not necessarily improve with a larger proportion of informed agents. Instead, it is established that the larger the proportion of informed agents is, the faster the convergence rate of the network becomes albeit at the expense of some deterioration in mean-square performance. The results further establish that uninformed agents play an important role in determining the steady-state performance of the network, and that it is preferable to keep some of the highly connected agents uninformed. The arguments reveal an important interplay among three factors: the number and distribution of informed agents in the network, the convergence rate of the learning process, and the estimation accuracy in steady-state. Expressions that quantify these relations are derived, and simulations are included to support the theoretical findings. We further apply the results to two models that are widely used to represent behavior over complex networks, namely, the Erdos-Renyi and scale-free models.

010       Phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard Model on Complex Networks
021       Critical phenomena can show unusual phase diagrams when defined in complex network topologies. 
020       The case of classical phase transitions such as the classical Ising model and the percolation transition has been studied extensively in the last decade. Here we show that the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model, an exclusively quantum mechanical phase transition, also changes significantly when defined on random scale-free networks. We present a mean-field calculation of the model in annealed networks and we show that when the second moment of the average degree diverges the Mott-insulator phase disappears in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover we study the model on quenched networks and we show that the Mott-insulator phase disappears in the thermodynamic limit as long as the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix diverges. Finally we study the phase diagram of the model on Apollonian scale-free networks that can be embedded in 2 dimensions showing the extension of the results also to this case.

010       Network Cosmology
021       Prediction and control of the dynamics of complex networks is a central problem in network science. 
020       Structural and dynamical similarities of different real networks suggest that some universal laws might accurately describe the dynamics of these networks, albeit the nature and common origin of such laws remain elusive. Here we show that the causal network representing the large-scale structure of spacetime in our accelerating universe is a power-law graph with strong clustering, similar to many complex networks such as the Internet, social, or biological networks. We prove that this structural similarity is a consequence of the asymptotic equivalence between the large-scale growth dynamics of complex networks and causal networks. This equivalence suggests that unexpectedly similar laws govern the dynamics of complex networks and spacetime in the universe, with implications to network science and cosmology.

021       We introduce the concept of control centrality to quantify the ability of a single node to control a directed weighted network. 
020       We calculate the distribution of control centrality for several real networks and find that it is mainly determined by the network's degree distribution. We rigorously prove that in a directed network without loops the control centrality of a node is uniquely determined by its layer index or topological position in the underlying hierarchical structure of the network. Inspired by the deep relation between control centrality and hierarchical structure in a general directed network, we design an efficient attack strategy against the controllability of malicious networks.

021       We introduce a simple model of static networks, where nodes are located on a ring structure, and two accompanying dynamic rules of repeated averaging on periodic node states. 
020       We assume nodes can interact with neighbors, and will add long-range links randomly. The number of long-range links, E, controls structures of these networks, and we show that there exist many types of fixed points, when E is varied. When E is low, fixed points are mostly diverse states, in which node states are diversely populated; on the other hand, when E is high, fixed points tend to be dominated by converged states, in which node states converge to one value. Numerically, we observe properties of fixed points for various E's, and also estimate points of the transition from diverse states to converged states for four different cases. This kind of simple network models will help us understand how diversities that we encounter in many systems of complex networks are sustained, even when mechanisms of averaging are at work,and when they break down if more long-range connections are added.

010       Analytical framework for recurrence-network analysis of time series
021       Recurrence networks are a powerful nonlinear tool for time series analysis of complex dynamical systems. 
020       {While there are already many successful applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an $\varepsilon$-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a "continuous" graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of the attractor on the scale given by $\varepsilon$.} In particular, we introduce local measures such as the $\varepsilon$-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic measures such as $\varepsilon$-motif density, path-based measures such as $\varepsilon$-betweennesses, and global measures such as $\varepsilon$-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion for the choice of $\varepsilon$ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic and two-dimensional quasi-periodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes, by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks with spatial constraints which appear frequently in disciplines ranging from biology to climate science.

010       Online detection of temporal communities in evolving networks by   estrangement confinement
021       Temporal communities result from a consistent partitioning of nodes across multiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. 
020       Current methods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly generalizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used for finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the eventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is highly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal communities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s) found in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition distance called "estrangement" motivated by the inertia of inter-node relationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition quality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities. Specifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates that neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community affiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness in diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting behavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity in human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in synthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in evolving networks.

010       Branching process approach for Boolean bipartite networks of metabolic   reactions
021       The branching process (BP) approach has been successful in explaining the avalanche dynamics in complex networks. 
020       However, its applications are mainly focused on unipartite networks, in which all nodes are of the same type. Here, motivated by a need to understand avalanche dynamics in metabolic networks, we extend the BP approach to a particular bipartite network composed of Boolean AND and OR logic gates. We reduce the bipartite network into a unipartite network by integrating out OR gates, and obtain the effective branching ratio for the remaining AND gates. Then the standard BP approach is applied to the reduced network, and the avalanche size distribution is obtained. We test the BP results with simulations on the model networks and two microbial metabolic networks, demonstrating the usefulness of the BP approach.

021       On a finite inhomogeneous graph model for complex network, we define the Ising model, which is a paradigm model in statistical mechanics. 
020       For the ferromagnetic Ising model,we calculate the Thermodynamic limit of pressure per particle. From our results, we compute other physical quantities such as the magnetization and susceptibility, and investigate the critical behaviour of this model. Our calculations use large deviation principles (developed recently) for suitably defined empirical neighbourhood measures on inhomogeneous random graph.

010       Consensus clustering in complex networks
021       The community structure of complex networks reveals both their organization and hidden relationships among their constituents. 
020       Most community detection methods currently available are not deterministic, and their results typically depend on the specific random seeds, initial conditions and tie-break rules adopted for their execution. Consensus clustering is used in data analysis to generate stable results out of a set of partitions delivered by stochastic methods. Here we show that consensus clustering can be combined with any existing method in a self-consistent way, enhancing considerably both the stability and the accuracy of the resulting partitions. This framework is also particularly suitable to monitor the evolution of community structure in temporal networks. An application of consensus clustering to a large citation network of physics papers demonstrates its capability to keep track of the birth, death and diversification of topics.

010       Robustness of Complex Networks with Implications for Consensus and   Contagion
021       We study a graph-theoretic property known as robustness, which plays a key role in certain classes of dynamics on networks (such as resilient consensus, contagion and bootstrap percolation). 
020       This property is stronger than other graph properties such as connectivity and minimum degree in that one can construct graphs with high connectivity and minimum degree but low robustness. However, we show that the notions of connectivity and robustness coincide on common random graph models for complex networks (Erdos-Renyi, geometric random, and preferential attachment graphs). More specifically, the properties share the same threshold function in the Erdos-Renyi model, and have the same values in one-dimensional geometric graphs and preferential attachment networks. This indicates that a variety of purely local diffusion dynamics will be effective at spreading information in such networks. Although graphs generated according to the above constructions are inherently robust, we also show that it is coNP-complete to determine whether any given graph is robust to a specified extent.

010       Explosive first-order transition to synchrony in networked chaotic   oscillators
021       Critical phenomena in complex networks, and the emergence of dynamical abrupt transitions in the macroscopic state of the system are currently a subject of the outmost interest. 
020       We report evidence of an explosive phase synchronization in networks of chaotic units. Namely, by means of both extensive simulations of networks made up of chaotic units, and validation with an experiment of electronic circuits in a star configuration, we demonstrate the existence of a first order transition towards synchronization of the phases of the networked units. Our findings constitute the first prove of this kind of synchronization in practice, thus opening the path to its use in real-world applications.

010       A quantitative measure, mechanism and attractor for self-organization in   networked complex systems
021       Quantity of organization in complex networks here is measured as the inverse of the average sum of physical actions of all elements per unit motion multiplied by the Planck's constant. 
020       The meaning of quantity of organization is the inverse of the number of quanta of action per one unit motion of an element. This definition can be applied to the organization of any complex system. Systems self-organize to decrease the average action per element per unit motion. This lowest action state is the attractor for the continuous self-organization and evolution of a dynamical complex system. Constraints increase this average action and constraint minimization by the elements is a basic mechanism for action minimization. Increase of quantity of elements in a network, leads to faster constraint minimization through grouping, decrease of average action per element and motion and therefore accelerated rate of self-organization. Progressive development, as self-organization, is a process of minimization of action.

010       Activity-dependent neuronal model on complex networks
021       Neuronal avalanches are a novel mode of activity in neuronal networks, experimentally found in vitro and in vivo, and exhibit a robust critical behaviour: These avalanches are characterized by a power law distribution for the size and duration, features found in other problems in the context of the physics of complex systems. 
020       We present a recent model inspired in self-organized criticality, which consists of an electrical network with threshold firing, refractory period and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The model reproduces the critical behaviour of the distribution of avalanche sizes and durations measured experimentally. Moreover, the power spectra of the electrical signal reproduce very robustly the power law behaviour found in human electroencephalogram (EEG) spectra. We implement this model on a variety of complex networks, i.e. regular, small-world and scale-free and verify the robustness of the critical behaviour.

010       Variability of Contact Process in Complex Networks
021       We study numerically how the structures of distinct networks influence the epidemic dynamics in contact process. 
020       We first find that the variability difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks is very narrow, although the heterogeneous structures can induce the lighter prevalence. Contrary to non-community networks, strong community structures can cause the secondary outbreak of prevalence and two peaks of variability appeared. Especially in the local community, the extraordinarily large variability in early stage of the outbreak makes the prediction of epidemic spreading hard. Importantly, the bridgeness plays a significant role in the predictability, meaning the further distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness, the less accurate the predictability is. Also, we investigate the effect of different disease reaction mechanisms on variability, and find that the different reaction mechanisms will result in the distinct variabilities at the end of epidemic spreading.

010       Collective Almost Synchronization in Complex Networks
021       This work introduces the phenomenon of Collective Almost Synchronization (CAS), which describes a universal way of how patterns can appear in complex networks even for small coupling strengths. 
020       The CAS phenomenon appears due to the existence of an approximately constant local mean field and is characterized by having nodes with trajectories evolving around periodic stable orbits. Common notion based on statistical knowledge would lead one to interpret the appearance of a local constant mean field as a consequence of the fact that the behavior of each node is not correlated to the behaviors of the others. Contrary to this common notion, we show that various well known weaker forms of synchronization (almost, time-lag, phase synchronization, and generalized synchronization) appear as a result of the onset of an almost constant local mean field. If the memory is formed in a brain by minimising the coupling strength among neurons and maximising the number of possible patterns, then the CAS phenomenon is a plausible explanation for it.

So as to assess the predictability-power of our present formalism, we advance a prediction, regarding the next 60 months, for the number of users of the three main web browsers (Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) popularly referred as "Browser Wars".

010       Global disorder transition in the community structure of large-q Potts   systems
021       We examine a global disorder transition when identifying community structure in an arbitrary complex network. 
020       Earlier, we illustrated [Phil. Mag. 92, 406 (2012)] that "community detection" (CD) generally exhibits disordered (or unsolvable) and ordered (solvable) phases of both high and low computational complexity along with corresponding transitions from regular to chaotic dynamics in derived systems. Using an exact generalized dimensional reduction inequality, multivariate Tutte polynomials, and other considerations, we illustrate how increasing the number of communities q emulates increasing the heat bath temperature T for a general weighted Potts model, leading to global disorder in the community structure of arbitrary large graphs. Dimensional reduction bounds lead to results similar to those suggested by mean-field type approaches. Large systems tend toward global insolvability in the limit of large q above a crossover temperature $T_\times\approx L|J_e|/[N\ln{} q]$ where |J_e| is a typical interaction strength, L is the number of edges, and N is the number of nodes. For practical system sizes, a solvable phase is generally accessible at low T. The global nature of the disorder transition does not preclude solutions by local CD algorithms (even those that employ global cost function parameters) as long as community evaluations are locally determined.

010       Statistical Properties of Avalanches in Networks
021       We characterize the distributions of size and duration of avalanches propagating in complex networks. 
020       By an avalanche we mean the sequence of events initiated by the externally stimulated `excitation' of a network node, which may, with some probability, then stimulate subsequent firings of the nodes to which it is connected, resulting in a cascade of firings. This type of process is relevant to a wide variety of situations, including neuroscience, cascading failures on electrical power grids, and epidemology. We find that the statistics of avalanches can be characterized in terms of the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of an appropriate adjacency matrix which encodes the structure of the network. By using mean-field analyses, previous studies of avalanches in networks have not considered the effect of network structure on the distribution of size and duration of avalanches. Our results apply to individual networks (rather than network ensembles) and provide expressions for the distributions of size and duration of avalanches starting at particular nodes in the network. These findings might find application in the analysis of branching processes in networks, such as cascading power grid failures and critical brain dynamics. In particular, our results show that some experimental signatures of critical brain dynamics (i.e., power-law distributions of size and duration of neuronal avalanches), are robust to complex underlying network topologies.

010       Human Navigational Performance in a Complex Network with Progressive   Disruptions
021       The current paper is an investigation towards understanding the navigational performance of humans on a network when the "landmark" nodes are blocked. 
020       We observe that humans learn to cope up, despite the continued introduction of blockages in the network. The experiment proposed involves the task of navigating on a word network based on a puzzle called the wordmorph. We introduce blockages in the network and report an incremental improvement in performance with respect to time. We explain this phenomenon by analyzing the evolution of the knowledge in the human participants of the underlying network as more and more landmarks are removed. We hypothesize that humans learn the bare essentials to navigate unless we introduce blockages in the network which would whence enforce upon them the need to explore newer ways of navigating. We draw a parallel to human problem solving and postulate that obstacles are catalysts for humans to innovate techniques to solve a restricted variant of a familiar problem.

010       Beyond Random Walk and Metropolis-Hastings Samplers: Why You Should Not   Backtrack for Unbiased Graph Sampling
021       Graph sampling via crawling has been actively considered as a generic and important tool for collecting uniform node samples so as to consistently estimate and uncover various characteristics of complex networks. 
020       The so-called simple random walk with re-weighting (SRW-rw) and Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm have been popular in the literature for such unbiased graph sampling. However, an unavoidable downside of their core random walks -- slow diffusion over the space, can cause poor estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose non-backtracking random walk with re-weighting (NBRW-rw) and MH algorithm with delayed acceptance (MHDA) which are theoretically guaranteed to achieve, at almost no additional cost, not only unbiased graph sampling but also higher efficiency (smaller asymptotic variance of the resulting unbiased estimators) than the SRW-rw and the MH algorithm, respectively. In particular, a remarkable feature of the MHDA is its applicability for any non-uniform node sampling like the MH algorithm, but ensuring better sampling efficiency than the MH algorithm. We also provide simulation results to confirm our theoretical findings.

010       The stability to instability transition in the structure of large scale   networks
021       We examine phase transitions between the easy, hard, and the unsolvable phases when attempting to identify structure in large complex networks (community detection) in the presence of disorder induced by network noise (spurious links that obscure structure), heat bath temperature $T$, and system size $N$. 
020       When present, transitions at low temperature or low noise correspond to entropy driven (or "order by disorder") annealing effects wherein stability may initially increase as temperature or noise is increased before becoming unsolvable at sufficiently high temperature or noise. Additional transitions between contending viable solutions (such as those at different natural scales) are also possible. When analyzing community structure via a dynamical approach, "chaotic-type" transitions were previously identified [Phil. Mag. {\bf 92} 406 (2012)]. The correspondence between the spin-glass-type complexity transitions and transitions into chaos in dynamical analogs might extend to other hard computational problems. In this work, we examine large networks that have a large number of communities. We infer that large systems at a constant ratio of $q$ to the number of nodes $N$ asymptotically tend toward insolvability in the limit of large $N$ for any positive $T$. The asymptotic behavior of temperatures below which structure identification might be possible, $T_\times =O[1/\log q]$, decreases slowly, so for practical system sizes, there remains an accessible, and generally easy, global solvable phase at low temperature. We further employ multivariate Tutte polynomials to show that increasing $q$ emulates increasing $T$ for a general Potts model, leading to a similar stability region at low $T$. Given the relation between Tutte and Jones polynomials, our results further suggest a link between the above complexity transitions and transitions associated with random knots.

010       Ranking spreaders by decomposing complex networks
021       Ranking the nodes' ability for spreading in networks is a fundamental problem which relates to many real applications such as information and disease control. 
020       In the previous literatures, a network decomposition procedure called k-shell method has been shown to effectively identify the most influential spreaders. In this paper, we find that the k-shell method have some limitations when it is used to rank all the nodes in the network. We also find that these limitations are due to considering only the links between the remaining nodes (residual degree) while entirely ignoring all the links connecting to the removed nodes (exhausted degree) when decomposing the networks. Accordingly, we propose a mixed degree decomposition (MDD) procedure in which both the residual degree and the exhausted degree are considered. By simulating the epidemic process on the real networks, we show that the MDD method can outperform the k-shell and the degree methods in ranking spreaders. Finally, the influence of the network structure on the performance of the MDD method is discussed.

010       Jerarca: Efficient Analysis of Complex Networks Using Hierarchical   Clustering
021       Background: How to extract useful information from complex biological networks is a major goal in many fields, especially in genomics and proteomics. 
020       We have shown in several works that iterative hierarchical clustering, as implemented in the UVCluster program, is a powerful tool to analyze many of those networks. However, the amount of computation time required to perform UVCluster analyses imposed significant limitations to its use. <br />Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe the suite Jerarca, designed to efficiently convert networks of interacting units into dendrograms by means of iterative hierarchical clustering. Jerarca is divided into three main sections. First, weighted distances among units are computed using up to three different approaches: a more efficient version of UVCluster and two new, related algorithms called RCluster and SCluster. Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms based on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as UPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the trees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and intercluster connections. Outputs compatible with the phylogenetic software MEGA and the Cytoscape package are generated, allowing the results to be easily visualized. <br />Conclusions/Significance: The four main advantages of Jerarca in respect to UVCluster are: 1) Improved speed of a novel UVCluster algorithm; 2) Additional, alternative strategies to perform iterative hierarchical clustering; 3) Automatic evaluation of the hierarchical trees to obtain optimal partitions; and, 4) Outputs compatible with popular software such as MEGA and Cytoscape.

010       Enhancement of Tc in the Superconductor-Insulator Phase Transition on   Scale-Free Networks
021       A road map to understand the relation between the onset of the superconducting state with the particular optimum heterogeneity in granular superconductors is to study a Random Tranverse Ising Model on complex networks with a scale-free degree distribution regularized by and exponential cutoff p(k) \propto k^{-\gamma}\exp[-k/\xi]. 
020       In this paper we characterize in detail the phase diagram of this model and its critical indices both on annealed and quenched networks. To uncover the phase diagram of the model we use the tools of heterogeneous mean-field calculations for the annealed networks and the most advanced techniques of quantum cavity methods for the quenched networks. The phase diagram of the dynamical process depends on the temperature T, the coupling constant J and on the value of the branching ratio &lt;k(k-1)&gt;/&lt;k&gt; where k is the degree of the nodes in the network. For fixed value of the coupling the critical temperature increases linearly with the branching ration which diverges with the increasing cutoff value \xi or value of the \gamma exponent \gamma&lt; 3. This result suggests that the fractal disorder of the superconducting material can be responsible for an enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature. At low temperature and low couplings T&lt;&lt;1 and J&lt;&lt;1, instead, we observe a different behavior for annealed and quenched networks. In the annealed networks there is no phase transition at zero temperature while on quenched network we observe a Griffith phase dominated by extremely rare events and a phase transition at zero temperature. The Griffiths critical region, nevertheless, is decreasing in size with increasing value of the cutoff \xi of the degree distribution for values of the \gamma exponents \gamma&lt; 3.

010       The Landscape of Complex Networks
021       Topological landscape is introduced for networks with functions defined on the nodes. 
020       By extending the notion of gradient flows to the network setting, critical nodes of different indices are defined. This leads to a concise and hierarchical representation of the network. Persistent homology from computational topology is used to design efficient algorithms for performing such analysis. Applications to some examples in social and biological networks are demonstrated, which show that critical nodes carry important information about structures and dynamics of such networks.

010       Multiscale characterization of recurrence-based phase space networks   constructed from time series
021       Recently, a framework for analyzing time series by constructing an associated complex network has attracted significant research interest. 
020       One of the advantages of the complex network method for studying time series is that complex network theory provides a tool to describe either important nodes, or structures that exist in the networks, at different topological scale. This can then provide distinct information for time series of different dynamical systems. In this paper, we systematically investigate the recurrence-based phase space network of order $k$ that has previously been used to specify different types of dynamics in terms of the motif ranking from a different perspective. Globally, we find that the network size scales with different scale exponents and the degree distribution follows a quasi-symmetric bell shape around the value of $2k$ with different values of degree variance from periodic to chaotic R\"{o}ssler systems. Local network properties such as the vertex degree, the clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality are found to be sensitive to the local stability of the orbits and hence contain complementary information.

010       Percolation Computation in Complex Networks
021       K-clique percolation is an overlapping community finding algorithm which extracts particular structures, comprised of overlapping cliques, from complex networks. 
020       While it is conceptually straightforward, and can be elegantly expressed using clique graphs, certain aspects of k-clique percolation are computationally challenging in practice. In this paper we investigate aspects of empirical social networks, such as the large numbers of overlapping maximal cliques contained within them, that make clique percolation, and clique graph representations, computationally expensive. We motivate a simple algorithm to conduct clique percolation, and investigate its performance compared to current best-in-class algorithms. We present improvements to this algorithm, which allow us to perform k-clique percolation on much larger empirical datasets. Our approaches perform much better than existing algorithms on networks exhibiting pervasively overlapping community structure, especially for higher values of k. However, clique percolation remains a hard computational problem; current algorithms still scale worse than some other overlapping community finding algorithms.

010       Complex dynamics and scale invariance of one-dimensional memristive   networks
021       Memristive systems, namely resistive systems with memory, are attracting considerable attention due to their ubiquity in several phenomena and technological applications. 
020       Here, we show that even the simplest one-dimensional network formed by the most common memristive elements with voltage threshold bears non-trivial physical properties. In particular, by taking into account the single element variability we find i) dynamical acceleration and slowing down of the total resistance in adiabatic processes, ii) dependence of the final state on the history of the input signal with same initial conditions, iii) existence of switching avalanches in memristive ladders, and iv) independence of the dynamics voltage threshold with respect to the number of memristive elements in the network (scale invariance). An important criterion for this scale invariance is the presence of memristive systems with very small threshold voltages in the ensemble. These results elucidate the role of memory in complex networks and are relevant to technological applications of these systems.

010       Complex Networks from Simple Rewrite Systems
021       Complex networks are all around us, and they can be generated by simple mechanisms. 
020       Understanding what kinds of networks can be produced by following simple rules is therefore of great importance. We investigate this issue by studying the dynamics of extremely simple systems where are `writer' moves around a network, and modifies it in a way that depends upon the writer's surroundings. Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it, which are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a way for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space of 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of behaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover simple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range of natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate visualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically. We arrive at an empirical classification scheme which reveals a lot about the kinds of dynamics and networks that can be generated by these systems.

020       The recent studies have used correlation based distance metrics for defining and analyzing financial networks. In this work the singularity strength is employed to define a distance metric and the existence of hierarchical structure in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is investigated. The multi-fractal nature of the financial market, which is otherwise hidden in the correlation coefficient based prescriptions, is analyzed through the use of the singularity strength based method. The presence of a super cluster is exhibited in the network which accounts for half of the network size and is homogeneous in the sectoral composition of the South African market.

010       Quantum-Classical Transition in Complex Networks
021       The inherent properties of specific physical systems can be used as a metaphore for investigating the behavior of complex networks. 
020       This insight has already been put into practice by previous works, e.g., studying the network evolution in terms of phase transitions of quantum gases or representing distances among nodes as they were particle energies. In this work, we show that the emergence of a scale-free structure in complex networks can be represented in terms of a quantum-classical transition for quantum gases. In particular, we propose a model of fermionic networks that allows to investigate the network evolution and its dependence with the system temperature. Simulations, performed in accordance with the cited model, clearly highlight the separation between simple random vs. scale-free networks, with full correspondence with classical vs. quantum regions for quantum gases.

010       Anomaly distribution in quasar magnitudes: a test of lensing by an   hypothetic Supergiant Molecular Cloud in the Galactic halo
021       An anomaly in the distribution of quasar magnitudes based on the SDSS survey, has been recently reported by Longo (2012). 
020       The angular size of this anomaly is of the order of $\rm \pm 15^o$ on the sky. A low surface brightness smooth structure in $\gamma$-rays, coincides with the sky location and extent of the quasar anomaly, and is close to the Northern component of a pair of $\gamma$-ray bubbles discovered in the \sl Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope \rm survey. Molecular clouds are thought to be illuminated by cosmic rays. I test the hypothesis that the magnitude anomaly in the quasar distribution, is due to a lensing effect by an hypothetic Supergiant Molecular Cloud (SGMC) in the Galactic halo.A series of grid lens models are built by assuming firstly that a SGMC is a lattice with clumps of $\rm 10^{-3} M_\odot$, 10 AU in size, and assuming various filling factors of the cloud, and secondly a fractal structure. Local amplifications are calculated for these lenses by using the public software LensTool, and the single plane approximation. A complex network of caustics due to the clumpy structure is present. Our best single plane lens model capable of explaining Longo's effect, \sl at least in sparse regions, \rm requires a mass $\rm (1.5-4.1) \times 10^{10} ~M_\odot$ within $\rm 8.7 \times 8.7 \times (5-8.6) kpc^3$ at a lens plane distance of 20 kpc. It is constructed from a molecular cloud building block of $5 \times 10^5 M_\odot$ within a scale of 30 pc expanded by fractal scaling with dimension $D = 1.8-2$ up to 5-8.6 kpc for the SGMC. If such a Supergiant Molecular Cloud were demonstrated, it might be part of a lens explanation for the luminous anomaly discovered in quasars and in red galaxies. The mass budget may be varied by changing the cloud depth and the fractal dimension.

021       In this work, we inspect the reliability of controlling and quelling an epidemic disease mimicked by a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model defined on a complex network by means of current and implementable quarantine and isolation policies.

The topology of this network evolves taking into account a probability $q$ that aims at representing the quarantine or isolation process in which the connection with acquaintances is disrupted according to standard policies of control of epidemics. Within current policies of self-isolation and standard infection rates, our results show that the propagation is either only controllable for hypothetical rates of compliance or uncontrollable at all.

010       Alignment and integration of complex networks by hypergraph-based   spectral clustering
021       Complex networks possess a rich, multi-scale structure reflecting the dynamical and functional organization of the systems they model. 
020       Often there is a need to analyze multiple networks simultaneously, to model a system by more than one type of interaction or to go beyond simple pairwise interactions, but currently there is a lack of theoretical and computational methods to address these problems. Here we introduce a framework for clustering and community detection in such systems using hypergraph representations. Our main result is a generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theorem from which we derive spectral clustering algorithms for directed and undirected hypergraphs. We illustrate our approach with applications for local and global alignment of protein-protein interaction networks between multiple species, for tripartite community detection in folksonomies, and for detecting clusters of overlapping regulatory pathways in directed networks.

010       Quantum network coding for quantum repeaters
021       This paper considers quantum network coding, which is a recent technique that enables quantum information to be sent on complex networks at higher rates than by using straightforward routing strategies. 
020       Kobayashi et al. have recently showed the potential of this technique by demonstrating how any classical network coding protocol gives rise to a quantum network coding protocol. They nevertheless primarily focused on an abstract model, in which quantum resource such as quantum registers can be freely introduced at each node. In this work, we present a protocol for quantum network coding under weaker (and more practical) assumptions: our new protocol works even for quantum networks where adjacent nodes initially share one EPR-pair but cannot add any quantum registers or send any quantum information. A typically example of networks satisfying this assumption is {\emph{quantum repeater networks}}, which are promising candidates for the implementation of large scale quantum networks. Our results thus show, for the first time, that quantum network coding techniques can increase the transmission rate in such quantum networks as well.

020       Not long ago the emphasis on this field mostly focused on the effects of the structural properties on the global behavior of a dynamical process taking place in the system. Recently, some studies started to unveil the richness of interactions that occur between groups of nodes when we look at the small scale of interactions occurring in the network. Such findings call for a new systematic methodology to quantify, at node level, how a dynamics is being influenced (or differentiated) by the structure of the underlying system. Here we present a first step towards this direction, in which we define a new measurement that, based on dynamical characteristics obtained for a large set of initial conditions, compares the dynamical behavior of the nodes present in the system. Through this measurement we find the high capacity of networks, generated by the geographic and Barab\'asi-Albert models, to exhibit groups of nodes with distinct dynamics compared to the rest of the network. We also present a practical application of the methodology by using the neuronal network of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, where we show that the interneurons of the ventral cord presents a very large dynamical differentiation when compared to the rest of the network.

010       Network Mapping by Replaying Hyperbolic Growth
021       Recent years have shown a promising progress in understanding geometric underpinnings behind the structure, function, and dynamics of many complex networks in nature and society. 
020       However these promises cannot be readily fulfilled and lead to important practical applications, without a simple, reliable, and fast network mapping method to infer the latent geometric coordinates of nodes in a real network. Here we present HyperMap, a simple method to map a given real network to its hyperbolic space. The method utilizes a recent geometric theory of complex networks modeled as random geometric graphs in hyperbolic spaces. The method replays the network's geometric growth, estimating at each time step the hyperbolic coordinates of new nodes in a growing network by maximizing the likelihood of the network snapshot in the model. We apply HyperMap to the AS Internet, and find that: 1) the method produces meaningful results, identifying soft communities of ASs belonging to the same geographic region; 2) the method has a remarkable predictive power: using the resulting map, we can predict missing links in the Internet with high precision, outperforming popular existing methods; and 3) the resulting map is highly navigable, meaning that a vast majority of greedy geometric routing paths are successful and low-stretch. Even though the method is not without limitations, and is open for improvement, it occupies a unique attractive position in the space of trade-offs between simplicity, accuracy, and computational complexity.

010       Complex network analysis of literary and scientific texts
021       We present results from our quantitative study of statistical and network properties of literary and scientific texts written in two languages: English and Polish. 
020       We show that Polish texts are described by the Zipf law with the scaling exponent smaller than the one for the English language. We also show that the scientific texts are typically characterized by the rank-frequency plots with relatively short range of power-law behavior as compared to the literary texts. We then transform the texts into their word-adjacency network representations and find another difference between the languages. For the majority of the literary texts in both languages, the corresponding networks revealed the scale-free structure, while this was not always the case for the scientific texts. However, all the network representations of texts were hierarchical. We do not observe any qualitative and quantitative difference between the languages. However, if we look at other network statistics like the clustering coefficient and the average shortest path length, the English texts occur to possess more clustered structure than do the Polish ones. This result was attributed to differences in grammar of both languages, which was also indicated in the Zipf plots. All the texts, however, show network structure that differs from any of the Watts-Strogatz, the Barabasi-Albert, and the Erdos-Renyi architectures.

010       Markovian Dynamics on Complex Reaction Networks
021       Complex networks, comprised of individual elements that interact with each other through reaction channels, are ubiquitous across many scientific and engineering disciplines. 
020       Examples include biochemical, pharmacokinetic, epidemiological, ecological, social, neural, and multi-agent networks. A common approach to modeling such networks is by a master equation that governs the dynamic evolution of the joint probability mass function of the underling population process and naturally leads to Markovian dynamics for such process. Due however to the nonlinear nature of most reactions, the computation and analysis of the resulting stochastic population dynamics is a difficult task. This review article provides a coherent and comprehensive coverage of recently developed approaches and methods to tackle this problem. After reviewing a general framework for modeling Markovian reaction networks and giving specific examples, the authors present numerical and computational techniques capable of evaluating or approximating the solution of the master equation, discuss a recently developed approach for studying the stationary behavior of Markovian reaction networks using a potential energy landscape perspective, and provide an introduction to the emerging theory of thermodynamic analysis of such networks. Three representative problems of opinion formation, transcription regulation, and neural network dynamics are used as illustrative examples.

010       Clustering of tag-induced sub-graphs in complex networks
021       We study the behavior of the clustering coefficient in tagged networks. 
020       The rich variety of tags associated with the nodes in the studied systems provide additional information about the entities represented by the nodes which can be important for practical applications like searching in the networks. Here we examine how the clustering coefficient changes when narrowing the network to a sub-graph marked by a given tag, and how does it correlate with various other properties of the sub-graph. Another interesting question addressed in the paper is how the clustering coefficient of the individual nodes is affected by the tags on the node. We believe these sort of analysis help acquiring a more complete description of the structure of large complex systems.

010       Slow dynamics and rare-region effects in the contact process on weighted   tree networks
021       We show that generic, slow dynamics can occur in the contact process on complex networks with a tree-like structure and a superimposed weight pattern, in the absence of additional (non-topological) sources of quenched disorder. 
020       The slow dynamics is induced by rare-region effects occurring on correlated subspaces of vertices connected by large weight edges, and manifests in the form of a smeared phase transition. We conjecture that more sophisticated network motifs could be able to induce Griffiths phases, as a consequence of purely topological disorder.

010       Low prevalence, quasi-stationarity and power-law distribution in a model   of spreading
021       Understanding how contagions (information, infections, etc) are spread on complex networks is important both from practical as well as theoretical point of view. 
020       Considerable work has been done in this regard in the past decade or so. However, most models are limited in their scope and as a result only capture general features of spreading phenomena. Here, we propose and study a model of spreading which takes into account the strength or quality of contagions as well as the local (probabilistic) dynamics occurring at various nodes. Transmission occurs only after the quality-based fitness of the contagion has been evaluated by the local agent. The model exhibits quality-dependent exponential time scales at early times leading to a slowly evolving quasi-stationary state. Low prevalence is seen for a wide range of contagion quality for arbitrary large networks. We also investigate the activity of nodes and find a power-law distribution with a robust exponent independent of network topology. Our results are consistent with recent empirical observations.

010       DEMON: a Local-First Discovery Method for Overlapping Communities
021       Community discovery in complex networks is an interesting problem with a number of applications, especially in the knowledge extraction task in social and information networks. 
020       However, many large networks often lack a particular community organization at a global level. In these cases, traditional graph partitioning algorithms fail to let the latent knowledge embedded in modular structure emerge, because they impose a top-down global view of a network. We propose here a simple local-first approach to community discovery, able to unveil the modular organization of real complex networks. This is achieved by democratically letting each node vote for the communities it sees surrounding it in its limited view of the global system, i.e. its ego neighborhood, using a label propagation algorithm; finally, the local communities are merged into a global collection. We tested this intuition against the state-of-the-art overlapping and non-overlapping community discovery methods, and found that our new method clearly outperforms the others in the quality of the obtained communities, evaluated by using the extracted communities to predict the metadata about the nodes of several real world networks. We also show how our method is deterministic, fully incremental, and has a limited time complexity, so that it can be used on web-scale real networks.

010       Predation effects on mean time to extinction under demographic   stochasticity
021       Methods for predicting the probability and timing of a species' extinction are typically based on a combination of theoretical models and empirical data, and focus on single species population dynamics. 
020       Of course, species also interact with each other, forming more or less complex networks of interactions. Models to assess extinction risk often lack explicit incorporation of these interspecific interactions. We study a birth and death process in which the death rate includes an effect from predation. This predation rate is included via a general nonlinear expression for the functional response of predation to prey density. We investigate the effects of the foraging parameters (e.g. attack rate and handling time) on the mean time to extinction. Mean time to extinction varies by orders of magnitude when we alter the foraging parameters, even when we exclude the effects of these parameters on the equilibrium population size. In particular we observe an exponential dependence of the mean time to extinction on handling time. These findings clearly show that accounting for the nature of interspecific interactions is likely to be critically important when estimating extinction risk.

010       Obtaining Communities with a Fitness Growth Process
021       The study of community structure has been a hot topic of research over the last years. 
020       But, while successfully applied in several areas, the concept lacks of a general and precise notion. Facts like the hierarchical structure and heterogeneity of complex networks make it difficult to unify the idea of community and its evaluation. The global functional known as modularity is probably the most used technique in this area. Nevertheless, its limits have been deeply studied. Local techniques as the ones by Lancichinetti et al. and Palla et al. arose as an answer to the resolution limit and degeneracies that modularity has. <br />Here we start from the algorithm by Lancichinetti et al. and propose a unique growth process for a fitness function that, while being local, finds a community partition that covers the whole network, updating the scale parameter dynamically. We test the quality of our results by using a set of benchmarks of heterogeneous graphs. We discuss alternative measures for evaluating the community structure and, in the light of them, infer possible explanations for the better performance of local methods compared to global ones in these cases.

010       The stability of networks --- towards a structural dynamical systems   theory
021       The need to build a link between the structure of a complex network and the dynamical properties of the corresponding complex system (comprised of multiple low dimensional systems) has recently become apparent. 
020       Several attempts to tackle this problem have been made and all focus on either the controllability or synchronisability of the network --- usually analyzed by way of the master stability function, or the graph Laplacian. We take a different approach. Using the basic tools from dynamical systems theory we show that the dynamical stability of a network can easily be defined in terms of the eigenvalues of an homologue of the network adjacency matrix. This allows us to compute the stability of a network (a quantity derived from the eigenspectrum of the adjacency matrix). Numerical experiments show that this quantity is very closely related too, and can even be predicted from, the standard structural network properties. Following from this we show that the stability of large network systems can be understood via an analytic study of the eigenvalues of their fixed points --- even for a very large number of fixed points.

010       Core percolation on complex networks
021       As a fundamental structural transition in complex networks, core percolation is related to a wide range of important problems. 
020       Yet, previous theoretical studies of core percolation have been focusing on the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks with Poisson degree distribution, which are quite unlike many real-world networks with scale-free or fat-tailed degree distributions. Here we show that core percolation can be analytically studied for complex networks with arbitrary degree distributions. We derive the condition for core percolation and find that purely scale-free networks have no core for any degree exponents. We show that for undirected networks if core percolation occurs then it is always continuous while for directed networks it becomes discontinuous when the in- and out-degree distributions are different. We also apply our theory to real-world directed networks and find, surprisingly, that they often have much larger core sizes as compared to random models. These findings would help us better understand the interesting interplay between the structural and dynamical properties of complex networks.

I discuss a microscopic implementation of the F13 schematic model including multiple glassy states and the glass-glass transition. Results suggest that our approach is flexible enough to bridge alternative theoretical descriptions of glassy matter based on the notions of quenched disorder and dynamic facilitation.

010       A tale of two cities. Vulnerabilities of the London and Paris transit   networks
021       This paper analyses the impact of random failure or attack on the public transit networks of London and Paris in a comparative study. 
020       In particular we analyze how the dysfunction or removal of sets of stations or links (rails, roads, etc.) affects the connectivity properties within these networks. We show how accumulating dysfunction leads to emergent phenomena that cause the transportation system to break down as a whole. Simulating different directed attack strategies, we find minimal strategies with high impact and identify a-priory criteria that correlate with the resilience of these networks. To demonstrate our approach, we choose the London and Paris public transit networks. Our quantitative analysis is performed in the frames of the complex network theory - a methodological tool that has emerged recently as an interdisciplinary approach joining methods and concepts of the theory of random graphs, percolation, and statistical physics. In conclusion we demonstrate that taking into account cascading effects the network integrity is controlled for both networks by less than 0.5 % of the stations i.e. 19 for Paris and 34 for London.

010       Temporal percolation of the susceptible network in an epidemic spreading
021       In this work, we study the evolution of the susceptible individuals during the spread of an epidemic modeled by the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) process spreading on the top of complex networks. 
020       Using an edge-based compartmental approach and percolation tools, we find that a time-dependent quantity $\Phi_S(t)$, namely, the probability that a given neighbor of a node is susceptible at time $t$, is the control parameter of a node void percolation process involving those nodes on the network not-reached by the disease. We show that there exists a critical time $t_c$ above which the giant susceptible component is destroyed. As a consequence, in order to preserve a macroscopic connected fraction of the network composed by healthy individuals which guarantee its functionality, any mitigation strategy should be implemented before this critical time $t_c$. Our theoretical results are confirmed by extensive simulations of the SIR process.

010       Effect of Closed Paths in Complex networks on Six Degrees of Separation   and Disorder
021       Milgram Condition proposed by Aoyama et al. 
020       plays an important role on the analysis of "six degrees of separation". We have shown that the relations between Milgram condition and the generalized clustering coefficient, which was introduced as an index for measuring the number of closed paths by us, are absolutely different in scale free networks (Barabasi and Albert) and small world networks (Watts and Strogatz, Watts). This fact implies that the effect of closed paths on information propagation is different in both networks. In this article, we first investigate the difference and pursuit what is a crucial mathematical quantity for information propagation. As a result we find that a sort of "disorder" plays more important role for information propagation than partially closed paths included in a network. Next we inquired into it in more detail by introducing two types of intermediate networks. Then we find that the average of the local clustering coefficient and the generalized clustering coefficients $C_{(q)}$ have some different functions and important meanings, respectively. We also find that $C_{(q)}$ is close to the propagation of information on networks. Lastly, we show that realizability of six degrees of separation in networks can be understood in a unified way by disorder.

010       Long-Range Navigation on Complex Networks using L\&#x27;evy Random Walks
021       We introduce a strategy of navigation in undirected networks, including regular, random, and complex networks, that is inspired by L\'evy random walks, generalizing previous navigation rules. 
020       We obtained exact expressions for the stationary probability distribution, the occupation probability, the mean first passage time, and the average time to reach a node on the network. We found that the long-range navigation using the L\'evy random walk strategy, compared with the normal random walk strategy, is more efficient at reducing the time to cover the network. The dynamical effect of using the L\'evy walk strategy is to transform a large-world network into a small world. Our exact results provide a general framework that connects two important fields: L\'evy navigation strategies and dynamics on complex networks.

010       Criticality and the Onset of Ordering in the Standard Vicsek Model
021       Experimental observations of animal collective behavior have shown stunning evidence for the emergence of large-scale cooperative phenomena resembling phase transitions in physical systems. 
020       Indeed, quantitative studies have found scale-free correlations and critical behavior consistent with the occurrence of continuous, second-order phase transitions. The Standard Vicsek Model (SVM), a minimal model of self-propelled particles in which their tendency to align with each other competes with perturbations controlled by a noise term, appears to capture the essential ingredients of critical flocking phenomena. In this paper, we review recent finite-size scaling and dynamical studies of the SVM, which present a full characterization of the continuous phase transition through dynamical and critical exponents. We also present a complex network analysis of SVM flocks and discuss the onset of ordering in connection with XY-like spin models.

010       Generalized voter-like models on heterogeneous networks
021       We describe a generalization of the voter model on complex networks that encompasses different sources of degree-related heterogeneity and that is amenable to direct analytical solution by applying the standard methods of heterogeneous mean-field theory. 
020       Our formalism allows for a compact description of previously proposed heterogeneous voter-like models, and represents a basic framework within which we can rationalize the effects of heterogeneity in voter-like models, as well as implement novel sources of heterogeneity, not previously considered in the literature.

010       Motif Statistics and Spike Correlations in Neuronal Networks
021       Motifs are patterns of subgraphs of complex networks. 
020       We studied the impact of such patterns of connectivity on the level of correlated, or synchronized, spiking activity among pairs of cells in a recurrent network model of integrate and fire neurons. For a range of network architectures, we find that the pairwise correlation coefficients, averaged across the network, can be closely approximated using only three statistics of network connectivity. These are the overall network connection probability and the frequencies of two second-order motifs: diverging motifs, in which one cell provides input to two others, and chain motifs, in which two cells are connected via a third intermediary cell. Specifically, the prevalence of diverging and chain motifs tends to increase correlation. Our method is based on linear response theory, which enables us to express spiking statistics using linear algebra, and a resumming technique, which extrapolates from second order motifs to predict the overall effect of coupling on network correlation. Our motif-based results seek to isolate the effect of network architecture perturbatively from a known network state.

010       A Classification for Community Discovery Methods in Complex Networks
021       In the last few years many real-world networks have been found to show a so-called community structure organization. 
020       Much effort has been devoted in the literature to develop methods and algorithms that can efficiently highlight this hidden structure of the network, traditionally by partitioning the graph. Since network representation can be very complex and can contain different variants in the traditional graph model, each algorithm in the literature focuses on some of these properties and establishes, explicitly or implicitly, its own definition of community. According to this definition it then extracts the communities that are able to reflect only some of the features of real communities. The aim of this survey is to provide a manual for the community discovery problem. Given a meta definition of what a community in a social network is, our aim is to organize the main categories of community discovery based on their own definition of community. Given a desired definition of community and the features of a problem (size of network, direction of edges, multidimensionality, and so on) this review paper is designed to provide a set of approaches that researchers could focus on.

010       Recommendation systems in the scope of opinion formation: a model
021       Aggregated data in real world recommender applications often feature fat-tailed distributions of the number of times individual items have been rated or favored. 
020       We propose a model to simulate such data. The model is mainly based on social interactions and opinion formation taking place on a complex network with a given topology. A threshold mechanism is used to govern the decision making process that determines whether a user is or is not interested in an item. We demonstrate the validity of the model by fitting attendance distributions from different real data sets. The model is mathematically analyzed by investigating its master equation. Our approach provides an attempt to understand recommender system's data as a social process. The model can serve as a starting point to generate artificial data sets useful for testing and evaluating recommender systems.

010       Maximal-entropy random walk unifies centrality measures
021       In this paper analogies between different (dis)similarity matrices are derived. 
020       These matrices, which are connected to path enumeration and random walks, are used in community detection methods or in computation of centrality measures for complex networks. The focus is on a number of known centrality measures, which inherit the connections established for similarity matrices. These measures are based on the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, path enumeration, as well as on the stationary state, stochastic matrix or mean first-passage times of a random walk. Particular attention is paid to the maximal-entropy random walk, which serves as a very distinct alternative to the ordinary random walk used in network analysis. <br />The various importance measures, defined both with the use of ordinary random walk and the maximal-entropy random walk, are compared numerically on a set of benchmark graphs. It is shown that groups of centrality measures defined with the two random walks cluster into two separate families. In particular, the group of centralities for the maximal-entropy random walk, connected to the eigenvector centrality and path enumeration, is strongly distinct from all the other measures and produces largely equivalent results.

010       Statistical pairwise interaction model of stock market
021       Financial markets are a classical example of complex systems as they comprise many interacting stocks. 
020       As such, we can obtain a surprisingly good description of their structure by making the rough simplification of binary daily returns. Spin glass models have been applied and gave some valuable results but at the price of restrictive assumptions on the market dynamics or others are agent-based models with rules designed in order to recover some empirical behaviours. Here we show that the pairwise model is actually a statistically consistent model with observed first and second moments of the stocks orientation without making such restrictive assumptions. This is done with an approach based only on empirical data of price returns. Our data analysis of six major indices suggests that the actual interaction structure may be thought as an Ising model on a complex network with interaction strengths scaling as the inverse of the system size. This has potentially important implications since many properties of such a model are already known and some techniques of the spin glass theory can be straightforwardly applied. Typical behaviours, as multiple equilibria or metastable states, different characteristic time scales, spatial patterns, order-disorder, could find an explanation in this picture.

010       Towards a temporal network analysis of interactive WiFi users
021       Complex networks are used to depict topological features of complex systems. 
020       The structure of a network characterizes the interactions among elements of the system, and facilitates the study of many dynamical processes taking place on it. In previous investigations, the topological infrastructure underlying dynamical systems is simplified as a static and invariable skeleton. However, this assumption cannot cover the temporal features of many time-evolution networks, whose components are evolving and mutating. In this letter, utilizing the log data of WiFi users in a Chinese university campus, we infuse the temporal dimension into the construction of dynamical human contact network. By quantitative comparison with the traditional aggregation approach, we find that the temporal contact network differs in many features, e.g., the reachability, the path length distribution. We conclude that the correlation between temporal path length and duration is not only determined by their definitions, but also influenced by the microdynamical features of human activities under certain social circumstance as well. The time order of individuals' interaction events plays a critical role in understanding many dynamical processes via human close proximity interactions studied in this letter. Besides, our study also provides a promising measure to identify the potential superspreaders by distinguishing the nodes functioning as the relay hub.

010       Complex Network Analysis in Cricket : Community structure, player&#x27;s role   and performance index
021       This paper describes the applications of network methods for understanding interaction within members of sport teams.We analyze the interaction of batsmen in International Cricket matches. 
020       We generate batting partnership network (BPN) for different teams and determine the exact values of clustering coefficient, average degree, average shortest path length of the networks and compare them with the Erd\text{\"{o}}s-R\text{\'{e}}nyi model. We observe that the networks display small-world behavior and are disassortative in nature. We find that most connected batsman is not necessarily the most central and most central players are not necessarily the one with high batting averages. We study the community structure of the BPNs and identify each player's role based on inter-community and intra-community links. We observe that {\it Sir DG Bradman}, regarded as the best batsman in Cricket history does not occupy the central position in the network $-$ the so-called connector hub. We extend our analysis to quantify the performance, relative importance and effect of removing a player from the team, based on different centrality scores.

010       Space-Efficient Sampling from Social Activity Streams
021       In order to efficiently study the characteristics of network domains and support development of network systems (e.g. 
020       algorithms, protocols that operate on networks), it is often necessary to sample a representative subgraph from a large complex network. Although recent subgraph sampling methods have been shown to work well, they focus on sampling from memory-resident graphs and assume that the sampling algorithm can access the entire graph in order to decide which nodes/edges to select. Many large-scale network datasets, however, are too large and/or dynamic to be processed using main memory (e.g., email, tweets, wall posts). In this work, we formulate the problem of sampling from large graph streams. We propose a streaming graph sampling algorithm that dynamically maintains a representative sample in a reservoir based setting. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed methods empirically using several real-world data sets. Across all datasets, we found that our method produce samples that preserve better the original graph distributions.

010       Comparative Evaluation of Community Detection Algorithms: A Topological   Approach
021       Community detection is one of the most active fields in complex networks analysis, due to its potential value in practical applications. 
020       Many works inspired by different paradigms are devoted to the development of algorithmic solutions allowing to reveal the network structure in such cohesive subgroups. Comparative studies reported in the literature usually rely on a performance measure considering the community structure as a partition (Rand Index, Normalized Mutual information, etc.). However, this type of comparison neglects the topological properties of the communities. In this article, we present a comprehensive comparative study of a representative set of community detection methods, in which we adopt both types of evaluation. Community-oriented topological measures are used to qualify the communities and evaluate their deviation from the reference structure. In order to mimic real-world systems, we use artificially generated realistic networks. It turns out there is no equivalence between both approaches: a high performance does not necessarily correspond to correct topological properties, and vice-versa. They can therefore be considered as complementary, and we recommend applying both of them in order to perform a complete and accurate assessment.

010       Path Selection for Quantum Repeater Networks
021       Quantum networks will support long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) and distributed quantum computation, and are an active area of both experimental and theoretical research. 
020       Here, we present an analysis of topologically complex networks of quantum repeaters composed of heterogeneous links. Quantum networks have fundamental behavioral differences from classical networks; the delicacy of quantum states makes a practical path selection algorithm imperative, but classical notions of resource utilization are not directly applicable, rendering known path selection mechanisms inadequate. To adapt Dijkstra's algorithm for quantum repeater networks that generate entangled Bell pairs, we quantify the key differences and define a link cost metric, seconds per Bell pair of a particular fidelity, where a single Bell pair is the resource consumed to perform one quantum teleportation. Simulations that include both the physical interactions and the extensive classical messaging confirm that Dijkstra's algorithm works well in a quantum context. Simulating about three hundred heterogeneous paths, comparing our path cost and the total work along the path gives a coefficient of determination of 0.88 or better.

010       Complex networks embedded in space: Dimension and scaling relations   between mass, topological distance and Euclidean distance
021       Many real networks are embedded in space, where in some of them the links length decay as a power law distribution with distance. 
020       Indications that such systems can be characterized by the concept of dimension were found recently. Here, we present further support for this claim, based on extensive numerical simulations for model networks embedded on lattices of dimensions $d_e=1$ and $d_e=2$. <br />We evaluate the dimension $d$ from the power law scaling of (a) the mass of the network with the Euclidean radius $r$ and (b) the probability of return to the origin with the distance $r$ travelled by the random walker. Both approaches yield the same dimension. For networks with $\delta &lt; d_e$, $d$ is infinity, while for $\delta &gt; 2d_e$, $d$ obtains the value of the embedding dimension $d_e$. In the intermediate regime of interest $d_e \leq \delta &lt; 2 d_e$, our numerical results suggest that $d$ decreases continously from $d = \infty$ to $d_e$, with $d - d_e \sim (\delta - d_e)^{-1}$ for $\delta$ close to $d_e$. Finally, we discuss the scaling of the mass $M$ and the Euclidean distance $r$ with the topological distance $\ell$. Our results suggest that in the intermediate regime $d_e \leq \delta &lt; 2 d_e$, $M(\ell)$ and $r(\ell)$ do not increase with $\ell$ as a power law but with a stretched exponential, $M(\ell) \sim \exp [A \ell^{\delta' (2 - \delta')}]$ and $r(\ell) \sim \exp [B \ell^{\delta' (2 - \delta')}]$, where $\delta' = \delta/d_e$. The parameters $A$ and $B$ are related to $d$ by $d = A/B$, such that $M(\ell) \sim r(\ell)^d$. For $\delta &lt; d_e$, $M$ increases exponentially with $\ell$, as known for $\delta=0$, while $r$ is constant and independent of $\ell$. For $\delta \geq 2d_e$, we find power law scaling, $M(\ell) \sim \ell^{d_\ell}$ and $r(\ell) \sim \ell^{1/d_{min}}$, with $d_\ell \cdot d_{min} = d$.

010       Random degree-degree correlated networks
021       Correlations may affect propagation processes on complex networks. 
020       To analyze their effect, it is useful to build ensembles of networks constrained to have a given value of a structural measure, such as the degree-degree correlation $r$, being random in other aspects and preserving the degree distribution. This can be done through Monte Carlo optimization procedures. Meanwhile, when tuning $r$, other network properties may concomitantly change. Then, in this work we analyze, for the $r$-ensembles, the impact of $r$ on properties such as transitivity, branching and characteristic lengths, that are relevant when investigating spreading phenomena on these networks. The present analysis is performed for networks with degree distributions of two main types: either localized around a typical degree (with exponentially bounded asymptotic decay) or broadly distributed (with power-law decay). Correlation bounds and size effects are also investigated.

In this work, we focus on the navigational properties of spatial graphs. We use an recently user-centric navigation protocol to explore spatial layouts of complex networks that are optimal for navigation. These layouts are generated with a simple simulated annealing optimization technique. We compared these layouts to others targeted at better visualization. We discuss the spatial statistical properties of the optimized layouts for better navigability and its implication.

020       A master/slave computing model is simulated. A node is selected as master and distributes tasks among the other nodes (the clients). Topological measurements associated with the master node (e.g. its degree or betwenness centrality) are extracted and considered as predictors of the total execution time. It is found that the closeness centrality provides the best alternative. The effect of network size was also investigated.

021       Community detection is a very active field in complex networks analysis, consisting in identifying groups of nodes more densely interconnected relatively to the rest of the network. 
020       The existing algorithms are usually tested and compared on real-world and artificial networks, their performance being assessed through some partition similarity measure. However, artificial networks realism can be questioned, and the appropriateness of those measures is not obvious. In this study, we take advantage of recent advances concerning the characterization of community structures to tackle these questions. We first generate networks thanks to the most realistic model available to date. Their analysis reveals they display only some of the properties observed in real-world community structures. We then apply five community detection algorithms on these networks and find out the performance assessed quantitatively does not necessarily agree with a qualitative analysis of the identified communities. It therefore seems both approaches should be applied to perform a relevant comparison of the algorithms.

010       Multi-parameter models of innovation diffusion on complex networks
021       A model, applicable to a range of innovation diffusion applications with a strong peer to peer component, is developed and studied, along with methods for its investigation and analysis. 
020       A particular application is to individual households deciding whether to install an energy efficiency measure in their home. The model represents these individuals as nodes on a network, each with a variable representing their current state of adoption of the innovation. The motivation to adopt is composed of three terms, representing personal preference, an average of each individual's network neighbours' states and a system average, which is a measure of the current social trend. The adoption state of a node changes if a weighted linear combination of these factors exceeds some threshold. Numerical simulations have been carried out, computing the average uptake after a sufficient number of time-steps over many realisations at a range of model parameter values, on various network topologies, including random (Erdos-Renyi), small world (Watts-Strogatz) and (Newman's) highly clustered, community-based networks. An analytical and probabilistic approach has been developed to account for the observed behaviour, which explains the results of the numerical calculations.

010       Social and strategic imitation: the way to consensus
021       Humans do not always make rational choices, a fact that experimental economics is putting on solid grounds. 
020       The social context plays an important role in determining our actions, and often we imitate friends or acquaintances without any strategic consideration. We explore here the interplay between strategic and social imitative behaviors in a coordination problem on a social network. We observe that for interactions in 1D and 2D lattices any amount of social imitation prevents the freezing of the network in domains with different conventions, thus leading to global consensus. For interactions in complex networks, the interplay of social and strategic imitation also drives the system towards global consensus while neither dynamics alone does. We find an optimum value for the combination of imitative behaviors to reach consensus in a minimum time, and two different dynamical regimes to approach it: exponential when social imitation predominates, and power-law when strategic considerations dominate.

010       Signature stability analysis for networks of coupled dynamical systems   with Hermitian Jacobian
021       The central theme of complex systems research is understanding the emergent macroscopic properties of a system from the interplay of its microscopic constituents. 
020       Here, we ask what conditions a complex network of microscopic dynamical units has to meet to permit stationary macroscopic dynamics, such as stable equilibria or phase-locked states. We present an analytical approach which is based on a graphical notation that allows rewriting Jacobi's signature criterion in an interpretable form. The derived conditions pertain to topological structures on all scales, ranging from individual nodes to the interaction network as a whole. Our approach can be applied to many systems of symmetrically coupled units. For the purpose of illustration, we consider the example of synchronization, specifically the (heterogeneous) Kuramoto model and an adaptive variant. Moreover, we discuss how the graphical notation can be employed to study isospectrality in Hermitian matrices. The results complete and extend the previous analysis of Do et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 194102 (2012)].

010       Using Community Structure for Complex Network Layout
021       We present a new layout algorithm for complex networks that combines a multi-scale approach for community detection with a standard force-directed design. 
020       Since community detection is computationally cheap, we can exploit the multi-scale approach to generate network configurations with close-to-minimal energy very fast. As a further asset, we can use the knowledge of the community structure to facilitate the interpretation of large networks, for example the network defined by protein-protein interactions.

010       Adaptive Fractal-like Network Structure for Efficient Search of   Inhomogeneously Distributed Targets at Unknown Positions
021       Since a spatial distribution of communication requests is inhomogeneous and related to a population, in constructing a network, it is crucial for delivering packets on short paths through the links between proximity nodes and for distributing the load of nodes how to locate the nodes as base-stations on a realistic wireless environment. 
020       In this paper, from viewpoints of complex network science and biological foraging, we propose a scalably self-organized geographical network, in which the proper positions of nodes and the network topology are simultaneously determined according to the population, by iterative divisions of rectangles for load balancing of nodes in the adaptive change of their territories. In particular, we consider a decentralized routing by using only local information,and show that, for searching targets around high population areas, the routing on the naturally embedded fractal-like structure by population has higher efficiency than the conventionally optimal strategy on a square lattice.

010       Synchronization in Complex Oscillator Networks and Smart Grids
021       The emergence of synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators is a fascinating topic in various scientific disciplines. 
020       A coupled oscillator network is characterized by a population of heterogeneous oscillators and a graph describing the interaction among them. It is known that a strongly coupled and sufficiently homogeneous network synchronizes, but the exact threshold from incoherence to synchrony is unknown. Here we present a novel, concise, and closed-form condition for synchronization of the fully nonlinear, non-equilibrium, and dynamic network. Our synchronization condition can be stated elegantly in terms of the network topology and parameters, or equivalently in terms of an intuitive, linear, and static auxiliary system. Our results significantly improve upon the existing conditions advocated thus far, they are provably exact for various interesting network topologies and parameters, they are statistically correct for almost all networks, and they can be applied equally to synchronization phenomena arising in physics and biology as well as in engineered oscillator networks such as electric power networks. We illustrate the validity, the accuracy, and the practical applicability of our results in complex networks scenarios and in smart grid applications.

010       Inferring complex networks from time series of dynamical systems:   Pitfalls, misinterpretations, and possible solutions
021       Understanding the dynamics of spatially extended systems represents a challenge in diverse scientific disciplines, ranging from physics and mathematics to the earth and climate sciences or the neurosciences. 
020       This challenge has stimulated the development of sophisticated data analysis approaches adopting concepts from network theory: systems are considered to be composed of subsystems (nodes) which interact with each other (represented by edges). In many studies, such complex networks of interactions have been derived from empirical time series for various spatially extended systems and have been repeatedly reported to possess the same, possibly desirable, properties (e.g. small-world characteristics and assortativity). In this thesis we study whether and how interaction networks are influenced by the analysis methodology, i.e. by the way how empirical data is acquired (the spatial and temporal sampling of the dynamics) and how nodes and edges are derived from multivariate time series. Our modeling and numerical studies are complemented by field data analyses of brain activities that unfold on various spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that indications of small-world characteristics and assortativity can already be expected due solely to the analysis methodology, irrespective of the actual interaction structure of the system. We develop and discuss strategies to distinguish the properties of interaction networks related to the dynamics from those spuriously induced by the analysis methodology. We show how these strategies can help to avoid misinterpretations when investigating the dynamics of spatially extended systems.

010       Study of dynamic and static routing for improvement of the   transportation efficiency on small complex networks
021       In this paper, we are exploring strategies for the reduction of the congestion in the complex networks. 
020       The nodes without buffers are considered, so, if the congestion occurs, the information packets will be dropped. The focus is on the efficient routing. The routing strategies are compared using two generic models, i.e., Barab\`asi-Albert scale-free network and scale-free network on lattice, and the academic router networks of the Netherlands and France. We propose a dynamic deflection routing algorithm which automatically extends path of the packet before it arrives at congested node. The simulation results indicate that the dynamic routing strategy can further reduce number of dropped packets in a combination with the efficient path routing proposed by Yan et al. [Phys. Rev. E 73, 046108 (2006)].

020       We here study different software systems developed in Java from the perspective of network science. The study reveals that network theory can provide a prominent set of techniques for the exploratory analysis of large complex software system. We further identify several applications in software engineering, and propose different network-based quality indicators that address software design, efficiency, reusability, vulnerability, controllability and other. We also highlight various interesting findings, e.g., software systems are highly vulnerable to processes like bug propagation, however, they are not easily controllable.

010       Locating the Source of Diffusion in Large-Scale Networks
021       How can we localize the source of diffusion in a complex network? Due to the tremendous size of many real networks--such as the Internet or the human social graph--it is usually infeasible to observe the state of all nodes in a network. 
020       We show that it is fundamentally possible to estimate the location of the source from measurements collected by sparsely-placed observers. We present a strategy that is optimal for arbitrary trees, achieving maximum probability of correct localization. We describe efficient implementations with complexity O(N^{\alpha}), where \alpha=1 for arbitrary trees, and \alpha=3 for arbitrary graphs. In the context of several case studies, we determine how localization accuracy is affected by various system parameters, including the structure of the network, the density of observers, and the number of observed cascades.

021       Concepts such as energy dependence, random deployment, dynamic topological update, self-organization, varying large number of nodes are among many factors that make WSNs a type of complex system. 
020       However, when analyzing WSNs properties using complex network tools, classical topological measures must be considered with care as they might not be applicable in their original form. In this work, we focus on the topological measures frequently used in the related field of Internet topological analysis. We illustrate their applicability to the WSNs domain through simulation experiments. In the cases when the classic metrics turn out to be incompatible, we propose some alternative measures and discuss them based on the WSNs characteristics.

010       Discriminating different classes of biological networks by analyzing the   graphs spectra distribution
021       The brain's structural and functional systems, protein-protein interaction, and gene networks are examples of biological systems that share some features of complex networks, such as highly connected nodes, modularity, and small-world topology. 
020       Recent studies indicate that some pathologies present topological network alterations relative to norms seen in the general population. Therefore, methods to discriminate the processes that generate the different classes of networks (e.g., normal and disease) might be crucial for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. It is known that several topological properties of a network (graph) can be described by the distribution of the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. Moreover, large networks generated by the same random process have the same spectrum distribution, allowing us to use it as a "fingerprint". Based on this relationship, we introduce and propose the entropy of a graph spectrum to measure the "uncertainty" of a random graph and the Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences between graph spectra to compare networks. We also introduce general methods for model selection and network model parameter estimation, as well as a statistical procedure to test the nullity of divergence between two classes of complex networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods by applying them on (1) protein-protein interaction networks of different species and (2) on networks derived from children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children. We conclude that scale-free networks best describe all the protein-protein interactions. Also, we show that our proposed measures succeeded in the identification of topological changes in the network while other commonly used measures (number of edges, clustering coefficient, average path length) failed.

010       Accounting for the kinetics in order parameter analysis: lessons from   theoretical models and a disordered peptide
021       Molecular simulations as well as single molecule experiments have been widely analyzed in terms order parameters, the latter representing candidate probes for the relevant degrees of freedom. 
020       Notwithstanding this approach is very intuitive, mounting evidence showed that such description is not accurate, leading to ambiguous definitions of states and wrong kinetics. To overcome these limitations a framework making use of order parameter fluctuations in conjunction with complex network analysis is investigated. Derived from recent advances in the analysis of single molecule time traces, this approach takes into account of the fluctuations around each time point to distinguish between states that have similar values of the order parameter but different dynamics. Snapshots with similar fluctuations are used as nodes of a transition network, the clusterization of which into states provides accurate Markov-State-Models of the system under study. Application of the methodology to theoretical models with a noisy order parameter as well as the dynamics of a disordered peptide illustrates the possibility to build accurate descriptions of molecular processes on the sole basis of order parameter time series without using any supplementary information.

010       Maximal entropy random walk in community finding
021       The aim of this paper is to check feasibility of using the maximal-entropy random walk in algorithms finding communities in complex networks. 
020       A number of such algorithms exploit an ordinary or a biased random walk for this purpose. Their key part is a (dis)similarity matrix, according to which nodes are grouped. This study encompasses the use of the stochastic matrix of a random walk, its mean first-passage time matrix, and a matrix of weighted paths count. We briefly indicate the connection between those quantities and propose substituting the maximal-entropy random walk for the previously chosen models. This unique random walk maximises the entropy of ensembles of paths of given length and endpoints, which results in equiprobability of those paths. We compare performance of the selected algorithms on LFR benchmark graphs. The results show that the change in performance depends very strongly on the particular algorithm, and can lead to slight improvements as well as significant deterioration.

010       A Model of the Cellular Iron Homeostasis Network Using Semi-Formal   Methods for Parameter Space Exploration
021       This paper presents a novel framework for the modeling of biological networks. 
020       It makes use of recent tools analyzing the robust satisfaction of properties of (hybrid) dynamical systems. The main challenge of this approach as applied to biological systems is to get access to the relevant parameter sets despite gaps in the available knowledge. An initial estimate of useful parameters was sought by formalizing the known behavior of the biological network in the STL logic using the tool Breach. Then, once a set of parameter values consistent with known biological properties was found, we tried to locally expand it into the largest possible valid region. We applied this methodology in an effort to model and better understand the complex network regulating iron homeostasis in mammalian cells. This system plays an important role in many biological functions, including erythropoiesis, resistance against infections, and proliferation of cancer cells.

020       Models of continuous time quantum walks, which implicitly use time-reversal symmetric Hamiltonians, have been intensely used to investigate the effectiveness of transport. Here we show how breaking time-reversal symmetry of the unitary dynamics in this model can enable directional control, enhancement, and suppression of quantum transport. Examples ranging from exciton transport to complex networks are presented. This opens new prospects for more efficient methods to transport energy and information.

010       Spectral analysis of Gene co-expression network of Zebrafish
021       We analyze the gene expression data of Zebrafish under the combined framework of complex networks and random matrix theory. 
020       The nearest neighbor spacing distribution of the corresponding matrix spectra follows random matrix predictions of Gaussian orthogonal statistics. Based on the eigenvector analysis we can divide the spectra into two parts, first part for which the eigenvector localization properties match with the random matrix theory predictions, and the second part for which they show deviation from the theory and hence are useful to understand the system dependent properties. Spectra with the localized eigenvectors can be characterized into three groups based on the eigenvalues. We explore the position of localized nodes from these different categories. Using an overlap measure, we find that the top contributing nodes in the different groups carry distinguished structural features. Furthermore, the top contributing nodes of the different localized eigenvectors corresponding to the lower eigenvalue regime form different densely connected structure well separated from each other. Preliminary biological interpretation of the genes, associated with the top contributing nodes in the localized eigenvectors, suggests that the genes corresponding to same vector share common features.

010       Local multiresolution order in community detection
021       Community detection algorithms attempt to find the best clusters of nodes in an arbitrary complex network. 
020       Multi-scale ("multiresolution") community detection extends the problem to identify the best network scale(s) for these clusters. The latter task is generally accomplished by analyzing community stability simultaneously for all clusters in the network. In the current work, we extend this general approach to define local multiresolution methods, which enable the extraction of well-defined local communities even if the global community structure is vaguely defined in an average sense. Toward this end, we propose measures analogous to variation of information and normalized mutual information that are used to quantitatively identify the best resolution(s) at the community level based on correlations between clusters in independently-solved systems. We demonstrate our method on a constructed and a real network and draw inferences about local community strength. Our approach is independent of the applied community detection algorithm save for the inherent requirement that the method be able to identify communities across different network scales, with appropriate changes to account for how different resolutions are evaluated or defined in a particular community detection method. It should, in principle, easily adapt to alternative community comparison measures.

010       Spectral Density of Complex Networks with Two Species of Nodes
021       The adjacency and Laplacian matrices of complex networks with two species of nodes are studied and the spectral density is evaluated by using the replica method in statistical physics. 
020       The network nodes are classified into two species (A and B) and the connections are made only between the nodes of different species. A static model of such bipartite networks with power law degree distributions is introduced by applying Goh, Kahng and Kim's method to construct scale free networks. As a result, the spectral density is shown to obey a power law in the limit of large mean degree.

010       Distributed Generation and Resilience in Power Grids
021       We study the effects of the allocation of distributed generation on the resilience of power grids. 
020       We find that an unconstrained allocation and growth of the distributed generation can drive a power grid beyond its design parameters. In order to overcome such a problem, we propose a topological algorithm derived from the field of Complex Networks to allocate distributed generation sources in an existing power grid.

010       Global efficiency of local immunization on complex networks
021       Epidemics occur in all shapes and forms: infections propagating in our sparse sexual networks, rumours and diseases spreading through our much denser social interactions, or viruses circulating on the Internet. 
020       With the advent of large databases and efficient analysis algorithms, these processes can be better predicted and controlled. In this study, we use different characteristics of network organization to identify the influential spreaders in 17 empirical networks of diverse nature using 2 epidemic models. We find that a judicious choice of local measures, based either on the network's connectivity at a microscopic scale or on its community structure at a mesoscopic scale, compares favorably to global measures, such as betweenness centrality, in terms of efficiency, practicality and robustness. We also develop an analytical framework that highlights a transition in the characteristic scale of different epidemic regimes. This allows to decide which local measure should govern immunization in a given scenario.

010       Nonlinear spread of rumor and inoculation strategies in the nodes with   degree dependent tie strength in complex networks
021       In earlier rumor spreading models, at each time step nodes contact all of their neighbors. 
020       In more realistic scenario it is possible that a node may contact only some of its neighbors to spread the rumor. Therefore it is must in real world complex networks, the classic rumor spreading model need to be modified to consider the dependence of rumor spread rate on the degree of the spreader and the informed nodes. We have given a modified rumor spreading model to accommodate these facts. This new model, has been studied for rumor spreading in complex networks in this work. Nonlinear rumor spread exponent $\alpha$ and degree dependent tie strength exponent $\beta$ in any complex network gives rumor threshold as some finite value. In the present work, the modified rumor spreading model has been studied in scale free networks. It is also found that if $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ parameters are tuned to appropriate value, the rumor threshold becomes independent of network size. In any social network, rumors can spread may have undesirable effect. One of the possible solutions to control rumor spread, is to inoculate a certain fraction of nodes against rumors. The inoculation can be done randomly or in a targeted fashion. We have used modified rumor spreading model over scale free networks to investigate the efficacy of inoculation. Random and targeted inoculation schemes have been applied. It has been observed that rumor threshold in random inoculation scheme is greater than the rumor threshold in the model without any inoculation scheme. But random inoculation is not that much effective. The rumor threshold in targeted inoculation is very high than the rumor threshold in the random inoculation in suppressing the rumor.

010       Hierarchy in directed random networks
021       In recent years, the theory and application of complex networks have been quickly developing in a markable way due to the increasing amount of data from real systems and to the fruitful application of powerful methods used in statistical physics. 
020       Many important characteristics of social or biological systems can be described by the study of their underlying structure of interactions. Hierarchy is one of these features that can be formulated in the language of networks. In this paper we present some (qualitative) analytic results on the hierarchical properties of random network models with zero correlations and also investigate, mainly numerically, the effects of different type of correlations. The behavior of hierarchy is different in the absence and the presence of the giant components. We show that the hierarchical structure can be drastically different if there are one-point correlations in the network. We also show numerical results suggesting that hierarchy does not change monotonously with the correlations and there is an optimal level of non-zero correlations maximizing the level of hierarchy.

010       From time series to complex networks: the Dynamical Visibility Graph
021       We are considering the mapping of the time series to complex networks (graphs). 
020       In this paper we propose the algorithm for constructing dynamic visibility graph (DVG). DVG consists of links of natural visibility graph (NVG), which satisfy an additional constraint, as determined by the newly introduced continuous parameter - the angle of view. Changing the angle of view modifies the DVG and, accordingly, its properties, such as the average node degree of the graph, connectivity, assortativity etc. We built relation of different DVG properties to the angle of view parameter. Such approach gives a new dynamical dimension to characterize time series. We investigated the dependence of the DVG properties for different types of time series: random (uncorrelated, correlated and fractal) and experimental time series (heart beat RR-intervals). It is shown that DVG approach allows to distinguish, identify and describe in detail various time series.

010       The effect of network structure on phase transitions in queuing networks
021       Recently, De Martino et al have presented a general framework for the study of transportation phenomena on complex networks. 
020       One of their most significant achievements was a deeper understanding of the phase transition from the uncongested to the congested phase at a critical traffic load. In this paper, we also study phase transition in transportation networks using a discrete time random walk model. Our aim is to establish a direct connection between the structure of the graph and the value of the critical traffic load. Applying spectral graph theory, we show that the original results of De Martino et al showing that the critical loading depends only on the degree sequence of the graph -- suggesting that different graphs with the same degree sequence have the same critical loading if all other circumstances are fixed -- is valid only if the graph is dense enough. For sparse graphs, higher order corrections, related to the local structure of the network, appear.

010       Synchronisation in networks of delay-coupled type-I excitable systems
021       We use a generic model for type-I excitability (known as the SNIPER or SNIC model) to describe the local dynamics of nodes within a network in the presence of non-zero coupling delays. 
020       Utilising the method of the Master Stability Function, we investigate the stability of the zero-lag synchronised dynamics of the network nodes and its dependence on the two coupling parameters, namely the coupling strength and delay time. Unlike in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model (a model for type-II excitability), there are parameter ranges where the stability of synchronisation depends on the coupling strength and delay time. One important implication of these results is that there exist complex networks for which the adding of inhibitory links in a small-world fashion may not only lead to a loss of stable synchronisation, but may also restabilise synchronisation or introduce multiple transitions between synchronisation and desynchronisation. To underline the scope of our results, we show using the Stuart-Landau model that such multiple transitions do not only occur in excitable systems, but also in oscillatory ones.

010       The role of caretakers in disease dynamics
021       One of the key challenges in modeling the dynamics of contagion phenomena is to understand how the structure of social interactions shapes the time course of a disease. 
020       Complex network theory has provided significant advances in this context. However, awareness of an epidemic in a population typically yields behavioral changes that correspond to changes in the network structure on which the disease evolves. This feedback mechanism has not been investigated in depth. For example, one would intuitively expect susceptible individuals to avoid other infecteds. However, doctors treating patients or parents tending sick children may also increase the amount of contact made with an infecteds, in an effort to speed up recovery but also exposing themselves to higher risks of infection. We study the role of these caretaker links in an adaptive network models where individuals react to a disease by increasing or decreasing the amount of contact they make with infected individuals. We find that pure avoidance, with only few caretaker links, is the best strategy for curtailing an SIS disease in networks that possess a large topological variability. In more homogeneous networks, disease prevalence is decreased for low concentrations of caretakers whereas a high prevalence emerges if caretaker concentration passes a well defined critical value.

010       Local Dimension of Complex Networks
021       Dimensionality is one of the most important properties of complex physical systems. 
020       However, only recently this concept has been considered in the context of complex networks. In this paper we further develop the previously introduced definitions of dimension in complex networks by presenting a new method to characterize the dimensionality of individual nodes. The methodology consists in obtaining patterns of dimensionality at different scales for each node, which can be used to detect regions with distinct dimensional structures as well as borders. We also apply this technique to power grid networks, showing, quantitatively, that the continental European power grid is substantially more planar than the network covering the western states of US, which present topological dimension higher than their intrinsic embedding space dimension. Local dimension also successfully revealed how distinct regions of network topologies spreads along the degrees of freedom when it is embedded in a metric space.

020       It has been known that this distribution depends on the topology of network by numerical simulations, however, no one have succeeded to explain it. Using "adiabatic" and "independent" assumptions along with the central-limit theorem, we derive equations that determine the probability distribution function. The results are compared to those of simulations for various networks. We find good agreement between our theory and the simulations, except the case of Watts--Strogatz networks with a low rewiring rate, due to the breakdown of independent assumption.

010       Binary-state dynamics on complex networks: pair approximation and beyond
021       A wide class of binary-state dynamics on networks---including, for example, the voter model, the Bass diffusion model, and threshold models---can be described in terms of transition rates (spin-flip probabilities) that depend on the number of nearest neighbors in each of the two possible states. 
020       High-accuracy approximations for the emergent dynamics of such models on uncorrelated, infinite networks are given by recently-developed compartmental models or approximate master equations (AME). Pair approximations (PA) and mean-field theories can be systematically derived from the AME. We show that PA and AME solutions can coincide under certain circumstances, and numerical simulations confirm that PA is highly accurate in these cases. For monotone dynamics (where transitions out of one nodal state are impossible, e.g., SI disease-spread or Bass diffusion), PA and AME give identical results for the fraction of nodes in the infected (active) state for all time, provided the rate of infection depends linearly on the number of infected neighbors. In the more general non-monotone case, we derive a condition---that proves equivalent to a detailed balance condition on the dynamics---for PA and AME solutions to coincide in the limit $t \to \infty$. This permits bifurcation analysis, yielding explicit expressions for the critical (ferromagnetic/paramagnetic transition) point of such dynamics, closely analogous to the critical temperature of the Ising spin model. Finally, the AME for threshold models of propagation is shown to reduce to just two differential equations, and to give excellent agreement with numerical simulations. As part of this work, Octave/Matlab code for implementing and solving the differential equation systems is made available for download.

010       Chaos and reliability in balanced spiking networks with temporal drive
021       Biological information processing is often carried out by complex networks of interconnected dynamical units. 
020       A basic question about such networks is that of reliability: if the same signal is presented many times with the network in different initial states, will the system entrain to the signal in a repeatable way? Reliability is of particular interest in neuroscience, where large, complex networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells are ubiquitous. These networks are known to autonomously produce strongly chaotic dynamics - an obvious threat to reliability. Here, we show that such chaos persists in the presence of weak and strong stimuli, but that even in the presence of chaos, intermittent periods of highly reliable spiking often coexist with unreliable activity. We elucidate the local dynamical mechanisms involved in this intermittent reliability, and investigate the relationship between this phenomenon and certain time-dependent attractors arising from the dynamics. A conclusion is that chaotic dynamics do not have to be an obstacle to precise spike responses, a fact with implications for signal coding in large networks.

010       Natural emergence of clusters and bursts in network evolution
021       Network models with preferential attachment, where new nodes are injected into the network and form links with existing nodes proportional to their current connectivity, have been well studied for some time. 
020       Extensions have been introduced where nodes attach proportionally to arbitrary fitness functions. However, in these models, attaching to a node always increases the ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth where nodes attach proportionally to the clustering coefficients, or local densities of triangles, of existing nodes. Attaching to a node typically lowers its clustering coefficient, in contrast to preferential attachment or rich-get-richer models. This simple modification naturally leads to a variety of rich phenomena, including aging, non-Poissonian bursty dynamics, and community formation. This theoretical model shows that complex network structure can be generated without artificially imposing multiple dynamical mechanisms and may reveal potentially overlooked mechanisms present in complex systems.

010       Classification of Critical Phenomena having a Parameter-Dependent   Renormalization
021       A generic classification of critical behavior is provided in systems for which the renormalization group equations are parameter dependent. 
020       It describes phase transitions in a wide class of networks with a hierarchical structure but also applies, for instance, to conformal field theories. Although these transitions generally do not exhibit universality, three distinct regimes of characteristic critical behavior can be discerned that combine an unusual mixture of second-order, infinite-order, and discontinuous transitions. In the spirit of Landau, the problem can be reduced to the local analysis of a cubic recursion equation, here, for the renormalization group flow of some generalized coupling. Among other insights, this theory explains the often noted prevalence of so-called inverted Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions in complex networks. As a demonstration, a one-parameter family of Ising models on hierarchical networks is considered.

021       We study the effects of nonzero time delays in stochastic synchronization problems with linear couplings in complex networks. 
020       We consider two types of time delays: transmission delays between interacting nodes and local delays at each node (due to processing, cognitive, or execution delays). By investigating the underlying fluctuations for several delay schemes, we obtain the synchronizability threshold (phase boundary) and the scaling behavior of the width of the synchronization landscape, in some cases for arbitrary networks and in others for specific weighted networks. Numerical computations allow the behavior of these networks to be explored when direct analytical results are not available. We comment on the implications of these findings for simple locally or globally weighted network couplings and possible trade-offs present in such systems.

010       Dynamics of link states in complex networks: The case of a majority rule
021       Motivated by the idea that some characteristics are specific to the relations between individuals and not of the individuals themselves, we study a prototype model for the dynamics of the states of the links in a fixed network of interacting units. 
020       Each link in the network can be in one of two equivalent states. A majority link-dynamics rule is implemented, so that in each dynamical step the state of a randomly chosen link is updated to the state of the majority of neighboring links. Nodes can be characterized by a link heterogeneity index, giving a measure of the likelihood of a node to have a link in one of the two states. We consider this link-dynamics model on fully connected networks, square lattices and Erd \"os-Renyi random networks. In each case we find and characterize a number of nontrivial asymptotic configurations, as well as some of the mechanisms leading to them and the time evolution of the link heterogeneity index distribution. For a fully connected network and random networks there is a broad distribution of possible asymptotic configurations. Most asymptotic configurations that result from link-dynamics have no counterpart under traditional node dynamics in the same topologies.

010       Structural robustness and transport efficiency of complex networks with   degree correlation
021       We examine two properties of complex networks, the robustness against targeted node removal (attack) and the transport efficiency in terms of degree correlation in node connection by numerical evaluation of exact analytic expressions. 
020       We find that, while the assortative correlation enhances the structural robustness against attack, the disassortative correlation significantly improves the transport efficiency of the network under consideration. This finding might shed light on the reason why some networks in the real world prefer assortative correlation and others prefer disassortative one.

010       Distribution of entanglement in large-scale quantum networks
021       The concentration and distribution of quantum entanglement is an essential ingredient in emerging quantum information technologies. 
020       Much theoretical and experimental effort has been expended in understanding how to distribute entanglement in one-dimensional networks. However, as experimental techniques in quantum communication develop, protocols for multi-dimensional systems become essential. Here, we focus on recent theoretical developments in protocols for distributing entanglement in regular and complex networks, with particular attention to percolation theory and network-based error correction.

010       Bootstrapping topology and systemic risk of complex network using the   fitness model
021       We present a novel method to reconstruct complex network from partial information. 
020       We assume to know the links only for a subset of the nodes and to know some non-topological quantity (fitness) characterising every node. The missing links are generated on the basis of the latter quan- tity according to a fitness model calibrated on the subset of nodes for which links are known. We measure the quality of the reconstruction of several topological properties, such as the network density and the degree distri- bution as a function of the size of the initial subset of nodes. Moreover, we also study the resilience of the network to distress propagation. We first test the method on ensembles of synthetic networks generated with the Exponential Random Graph model which allows to apply common tools from statistical mechanics. We then test it on the empirical case of the World Trade Web. In both cases, we find that a subset of 10 % of nodes is enough to reconstruct the main features of the network along with its resilience with an error of 5%.

010       Phase transitions with infinitely many absorbing states in complex   networks
021       We instigate the properties of the threshold contact process (TCP), a process showing an absorbing-state phase transition with infinitely many absorbing states, on random complex networks. 
020       The finite size scaling exponents characterizing the transition are obtained in a heterogeneous mean field (HMF) approximation and compared with extensive simulations, particularly in the case of heterogeneous scale-free networks. We observe that the TCP exhibits the same critical properties as the contact process (CP), which undergoes an absorbing-state phase transition to a single absorbing state. The accordance among the critical exponents of different models and networks leads to conjecture that the critical behavior of the contact process in a HMF theory is a universal feature of absorbing state phase transitions in complex networks, depending only on the locality of the interactions and independent of the number of absorbing states. The conditions for the applicability of the conjecture are discussed considering a parallel with the susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic spreading model, which in fact belongs to a different universality class in complex networks.

010       Stochastic dynamical model of a growing network based on self-exciting   point process
021       We perform experimental verification of the preferential attachment model that is commonly accepted as a generating mechanism of the scale-free complex networks. 
020       To this end we chose citation network of Physics papers and traced citation history of 40,195 papers published in one year. Contrary to common belief, we found that citation dynamics of the individual papers follows the \emph{superlinear} preferential attachment, with the exponent $\alpha= 1.25-1.3$. Moreover, we showed that the citation process cannot be described as a memoryless Markov chain since there is substantial correlation between the present and recent citation rates of a paper. Basing on our findings we constructed a stochastic growth model of the citation network, performed numerical simulations based on this model and achieved an excellent agreement with the measured citation distributions.

010       Non-consensus opinion models on complex networks
021       We focus on non-consensus opinion models in which above a certain threshold two opinions coexist in a stable relationship. 
020       We revisit and extend the non-consensus opinion (NCO) model introduced by Shao. We generalize the NCO model by adding a weight factor W to individual's own opinion when determining its future opinion (NCOW model). We find that as W increases the minority opinion holders tend to form stable clusters with a smaller initial minority fraction compared to the NCO model. We also revisit another non-consensus opinion, the inflexible contrarian opinion (ICO) model, which introduces inflexible contrarians to model a competition between two opinions in the steady state. In the ICO model, the inflexible contrarians effectively decrease the size of the largest cluster of the rival opinion. All of the above models have previously been explored in terms of a single network. However opinions propagate not only within single networks but also between networks, we study here the opinion dynamics in coupled networks. We apply the NCO rule on each individual network and the global majority rule on interdependent pairs. We find that the interdependent links effectively force the system from a second order phase transition, which is characteristic of the NCO model on a single network, to a hybrid phase transition, i.e., a mix of second-order and abrupt jump-like transitions that ultimately becomes, as we increase the percentage of interdependent agents, a pure abrupt transition. We conclude that for the NCO model on coupled networks, interactions through interdependent links could push the non-consensus opinion type model to a consensus opinion type model, which mimics the reality that increased mass communication causes people to hold opinions that are increasingly similar.

010       Predicting human preferences using the block structure of complex social   networks
021       With ever-increasing available data, predicting individuals' preferences and helping them locate the most relevant information has become a pressing need. 
020       Understanding and predicting preferences is also important from a fundamental point of view, as part of what has been called a "new" computational social science. Here, we propose a novel approach based on stochastic block models, which have been developed by sociologists as plausible models of complex networks of social interactions. Our model is in the spirit of predicting individuals' preferences based on the preferences of others but, rather than fitting a particular model, we rely on a Bayesian approach that samples over the ensemble of all possible models. We show that our approach is considerably more accurate than leading recommender algorithms, with major relative improvements between 38% and 99% over industry-level algorithms. Besides, our approach sheds light on decision-making processes by identifying groups of individuals that have consistently similar preferences, and enabling the analysis of the characteristics of those groups.

010       A quantitative method for determining the robustness of complex networks
021       Most current studies estimate the invulnerability of complex networks using a qualitative method that analyzes the inaccurate decay rate of network efficiency. 
020       This method results in confusion over the invulnerability of various types of complex networks. By normalizing network efficiency and defining a baseline, this paper defines the invulnerability index as the integral of the difference between the normalized network efficiency curve and the baseline. This quantitative method seeks to establish a benchmark for the robustness and fragility of networks and to measure network invulnerability under both edge and node attacks. To validate the reliability of the proposed method, three small-world networks were selected as test beds. The simulation results indicate that the proposed invulnerability index can effectively and accurately quantify network resilience. The index should provide a valuable reference for determining network invulnerability in future research.

010       Some scale-free networks could be robust under the selective node   attacks
021       It is a mainstream idea that scale-free network would be fragile under the selective attacks. 
020       Internet is a typical scale-free network in the real world, but it never collapses under the selective attacks of computer viruses and hackers. This phenomenon is different from the deduction of the idea above because this idea assumes the same cost to delete an arbitrary node. Hence this paper discusses the behaviors of the scale-free network under the selective node attack with different cost. Through the experiments on five complex networks, we show that the scale-free network is possibly robust under the selective node attacks; furthermore, the more compact the network is, and the larger the average degree is, then the more robust the network is; With the same average degrees, the more compact the network is, the more robust the network is. This result would enrich the theory of the invulnerability of the network, and can be used to build the robust social, technological and biological networks, and also has the potential to find the target of drugs.

010       Community Structure Detection in Complex Networks with Partial   Background Information
021       Constrained clustering has been well-studied in the unsupervised learning society. 
020       However, how to encode constraints into community structure detection, within complex networks, remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework for community structure detection. This framework implicitly encodes the must-link and cannot-link constraints by modifying the adjacency matrix of network, which can also be regarded as de-noising the consensus matrix of community structures. Our proposed method gives consideration to both the topology and the functions (background information) of complex network, which enhances the interpretability of the results. The comparisons performed on both the synthetic benchmarks and the real-world networks show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the community detection performance with few constraints, which makes it an attractive methodology in the analysis of complex networks.

010       Equalitarian Societies are Economically Impossible
021       The inequality of wealth distribution is a universal phenomenon in the civilized nations, and it is often imputed to the Matthew effect, that is, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 
020       Some philosophers unjustified this phenomenon and tried to put the human civilization upon the evenness of wealth. Noticing the facts that 1) the emergence of the centralism is the starting point of human civilization, i.e., people in a society were organized hierarchically, 2) the inequality of wealth emerges simultaneously, this paper proposes a wealth distribution model based on the hidden tree structure from the viewpoint of complex network. This model considers the organized structure of people in a society as a hidden tree, and the cooperations among human beings as the transactions on the hidden tree, thereby explains the distribution of wealth. This model shows that the scale-free phenomenon of wealth distribution can be produced by the cascade controlling of human society, that is, the inequality of wealth can parasitize in the social organizations, such that any actions in eliminating the unequal wealth distribution would lead to the destroy of social or economic structures, resulting in the collapse of the economic system, therefore, would fail in vain.

010       Enhanced Community Structure Detection in Complex Networks with Partial   Background Information
021       Community structure detection in complex networks is important since it can help better understand the network topology and how the network works. 
020       However, there is still not a clear and widely-accepted definition of community structure, and in practice, different models may give very different results of communities, making it hard to explain the results. In this paper, different from the traditional methodologies, we design an enhanced semi-supervised learning framework for community detection, which can effectively incorporate the available prior information to guide the detection process and can make the results more explainable. By logical inference, the prior information is more fully utilized. The experiments on both the synthetic and the real-world networks confirm the effectiveness of the framework.

010       Size Dependent Growth in Metabolic Networks
021       Accurately determining and classifying the structure of complex networks is the focus of much current research. 
020       One class of network of particular interest are metabolic pathways, which have previously been studied from a graph theoretical viewpoint in a number of ways. Metabolic networks describe the chemical reactions within cells and are thus of prime importance from a biological perspective. <br />Here we analyse metabolic networks from a section of microorganisms, using a range of metrics and attempt to address anomalies between the observed metrics and current descriptions of the graphical structure. We propose that the growth of the network may in some way be regulated by network size and attempt to reproduce networks with similar metrics to the metabolic pathways using a generative approach. We provide some hypotheses as to why biological networks may evolve according to these model criteria.

010       Contagion dynamics in time-varying metapopulation networks
021       The metapopulation framework is adopted in a wide array of disciplines to describe systems of well separated yet connected subpopulations. 
020       The subgroups or patches are often represented as nodes in a network whose links represent the migration routes among them. The connections have been so far mostly considered as static, but in general evolve in time. Here we address this case by investigating simple contagion processes on time-varying metapopulation networks. We focus on the SIR process and determine analytically the mobility threshold for the onset of an epidemic spreading in the framework of activity-driven network models. We find profound differences from the case of static networks. The threshold is entirely described by the dynamical parameters defining the average number of instantaneously migrating individuals and does not depend on the properties of the static network representation. Remarkably, the diffusion and contagion processes are slower in time-varying graphs than in their aggregated static counterparts, the mobility threshold being even two orders of magnitude larger in the first case. The presented results confirm the importance of considering the time-varying nature of complex networks.

010       Assessing the significance of knockout cascades in metabolic networks
021       Complex networks have been shown to be robust against random structural perturbations, but vulnerable against targeted attacks. 
020       Robustness analysis usually simulates the removal of individual or sets of nodes, followed by the assessment of the inflicted damage. For complex metabolic networks, it has been suggested that evolutionary pressure may favor robustness against reaction removal. However, the removal of a reaction and its impact on the network may as well be interpreted as selective regulation of pathway activities, suggesting a tradeoff between the efficiency of regulation and vulnerability. Here, we employ a cascading failure algorithm to simulate the removal of single and pairs of reactions from the metabolic networks of two organisms, and estimate the significance of the results using two different null models: degree preserving and mass-balanced randomization. Our analysis suggests that evolutionary pressure promotes larger cascades of non-viable reactions, and thus favors the ability of efficient metabolic regulation at the expense of robustness.

010       A simple model clarifies the complicated relationships of complex   networks
021       Researchers have discovered many types of complex networks and have proposed hundreds of models to explain their origins, yet most of the relationships within each of these types are still uncertain. 
020       Furthermore, because of the large number of types and models of complex networks, it is widely thought that these complex networks cannot all share a simple universal explanation. However, here we find that a simple model can produce many types of complex networks, including scale-free, small-world, ultra small-world, Delta-distribution, compact, fractal, regular and random networks, and by revising this model, we show that one can produce community-structure networks. Using this model and its revised versions, the complicated relationships among complex networks can be illustrated. Given that complex networks are regarded as a model tool of complex systems, the results here bring a new perspective to understanding the power law phenomena observed in various complex systems.

010       Discrete Signal Processing on Graphs
021       In social settings, individuals interact through webs of relationships. 
020       Each individual is a node in a complex network (or graph) of interdependencies and generates data, lots of data. We label the data by its source, or formally stated, we index the data by the nodes of the graph. The resulting signals (data indexed by the nodes) are far removed from time or image signals indexed by well ordered time samples or pixels. DSP, discrete signal processing, provides a comprehensive, elegant, and efficient methodology to describe, represent, transform, analyze, process, or synthesize these well ordered time or image signals. This paper extends to signals on graphs DSP and its basic tenets, including filters, convolution, z-transform, impulse response, spectral representation, Fourier transform, frequency response, and illustrates DSP on graphs by classifying blogs, linear predicting and compressing data from irregularly located weather stations, or predicting behavior of customers of a mobile service provider.

021       Computational inference of causal relationships underlying complex networks, such as gene-regulatory pathways, is NP-complete due to its combinatorial nature when permuting all possible interactions. 
020       Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been introduced to sample only part of the combinations while still guaranteeing convergence and traversability, which therefore becomes widely used. However, MCMC is not able to perform efficiently enough for networks that have more than 15~20 nodes because of the computational complexity. In this paper, we use general purpose processor (GPP) and general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) to implement and accelerate a novel Bayesian network learning algorithm. With a hash-table-based memory-saving strategy and a novel task assigning strategy, we achieve a 10-fold acceleration per iteration than using a serial GPP. Specially, we use a greedy method to search for the best graph from a given order. We incorporate a prior component in the current scoring function, which further facilitates the searching. Overall, we are able to apply this system to networks with more than 60 nodes, allowing inferences and modeling of bigger and more complex networks than current methods.

010       Une nouvelle mesure pour l&#x27;\&#x27;evaluation des m\&#x27;ethodes de d\&#x27;etection de   communaut\&#x27;es
021       Community detection can be considered as a variant of cluster analysis applied to complex networks. 
020       For this reason, all existing studies have been using tools derived from this field when evaluating community detection algorithms. However, those are not completely relevant in the context of network analysis, because they ignore a part of the available information, and can therefore lead to incorrect interpretations. In this article, we illustrate this limitation, and propose a solution by modifying an existing measure. We then apply it to realistic community-structured networks, in order to perform a first evaluation.---La d\'etection de communaut\'es dans un r\'eseau complexe est une t\^ache que l'on peut rapprocher de la classification non-supervis\'ee r\'ealis\'ee en fouille de donn\'ees classique. Pour cette raison, l'\'evaluation des algorithmes accomplissant ce type de traitement s'est faite jusqu'ici exclusivement au moyen de mesures comparables \`a celles utilis\'ees en fouille de donn\'ees. Cependant, dans le cas de l'analyse de r\'eseau, celles-ci n'exploitent pas toute l'information disponible et sont susceptibles de fournir des r\'esultats biais\'es. Dans cet article, nous illustrons cette limitation et proposons une solution en modifiant une mesure existante. Nous l'appliquons ensuite \`a des donn\'ees r\'ealistes afin d'en effectuer une premi\`ere \'evaluation exp\'erimentale.

010       Theory of Interface: Category Theory, Directed Networks and Evolution of   Biological Networks
021       Biological networks have two modes. 
020       The first mode is static: a network is a passage on which something flows. The second mode is dynamic: a network is a pattern constructed by gluing functions of entities constituting the network. In this paper, first we discuss that these two modes can be associated with the category theoretic duality (adjunction) and derive a natural network structure (a path notion) for each mode by appealing to the category theoretic universality. The path notion corresponding to the static mode is just the usual directed path. The path notion for the dynamic mode is called lateral path which is the alternating path considered on the set of arcs. Their general functionalities in a network are transport and coherence, respectively. Second, we introduce a betweenness centrality of arcs for each mode and see how the two modes are embedded in various real biological network data. We find that there is a trade-off relationship between the two centralities: if the value of one is large then the value of the other is small. This can be seen as a kind of division of labor in a network into transport on the network and coherence of the network. Finally, we propose an optimization model of networks based on a quality function involving intensities of the two modes in order to see how networks with the above trade-off relationship can emerge through evolution. We show that the trade-off relationship can be observed in the evolved networks only when the dynamic mode is dominant in the quality function by numerical simulations. We also show that the evolved networks have features qualitatively similar to real biological networks by standard complex network analysis.

010       Exponential random graph models
021       Nowadays, exponential random graphs (ERGs) are among the most widely-studied network models. 
020       Different analytical and numerical techniques for ERG have been developed that resulted in the well-established theory with true predictive power. An excellent basic discussion of exponential random graphs addressed to social science students and researchers is given in [Anderson et al., 1999][Robins et al., 2007]. This essay is intentionally designed to be more theoretical in comparison with the well-known primers just mentioned. Given the interdisciplinary character of the new emerging science of complex networks, the essay aims to give a contribution upon which network scientists and practitioners, who represent different research areas, could build a common area of understanding.

010       Decision dynamics in complex networks subject to mass media and social   contact transmission mechanisms
021       The dynamics of decisions in complex networks is studied within a Markov process framework using numerical simulations combined with mathematical insight into the process mechanisms. 
020       A mathematical discrete-time model is derived based on a set of basic assumptions on the convincing mechanisms associated to two opinions. The model is analyzed with respect to multiplicity of critical points, illustrating in this way the main behavior to be expected in the network. Particular interest is focussed on the effect of social network and exogenous mass media-based influences on the decision behavior. A set of numerical simulation results is provided illustrating how these mechanisms impact the final decision results. The analysis reveals (i) the presence of fixed-point multiplicity (with a maximum of four different fixed points), multistability, and sensitivity with respect to process parameters, and (ii) that mass media have a strong impact on the decision behavior.

010       Multi-Stratum Networks: toward a unified model of on-line identities
021       One of the reasons behind the success of Social Network Analysis is its simple and general graph model made of nodes (representing individuals) and ties. 
020       However, when we focus on our daily on-line experience we must confront a more complex scenario: people inhabitate several on-line spaces interacting to several communities active on various technological infrastructures like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or FourSquare and with distinct social objectives. This constitutes a complex network of interconnected networks where users' identities are spread and where information propagates navigating through different communities and social platforms. In this article we introduce a model for this layered scenario that we call multi-stratum network. Through a theoretical discussion and the analysis of real-world data we show how not only focusing on a single network may provide a very partial understanding of the role of its users, but also that considering all the networks separately may not reveal the information contained in the whole multi-stratum model.

010       Urban street networks: a comparative analysis of ten European cities
021       We compare the structural properties of the street networks of ten different European cities using their primal representation. 
020       We investigate the properties of the geometry of the networks and a set of centrality measures highlighting differences and similarities among cases. In particular, we found that cities share structural similarities due to their quasi planarity but that there are also several distinctive geometrical proprieties. A Principal Component Analysis is also performed on the distributions of centralities and their respective moments, which is used to find distinctive characteristics by which we can classify cities into families. We believe that, beyond the improvement of the empirical knowledge on streets network proprieties, our findings can open new perspectives in the scientific relation between city planning and complex networks, stimulating the debate on the effectiveness of the set of knowledge that statistical physics can contribute for city planning and urban morphology studies.

010       Social cohesion, structural holes, and a tale of two measures
021       In the social sciences, the debate over the structural foundations of social capital has long vacillated between two positions on the relative benefits associated with two types of social structures: closed structures, rich in third-party relationships, and open structures, rich in structural holes and brokerage opportunities. 
020       In this paper, we engage with this debate by focusing on the measures typically used for formalising the two conceptions of social capital: clustering and effective size. We show that these two measures are simply two sides of the same coin, as they can be expressed one in terms of the other through a simple functional relation. Building on this relation, we then attempt to reconcile closed and open structures by proposing a new measure, Simmelian brokerage, that captures opportunities of brokerage between otherwise disconnected cohesive groups of contacts. Implications of our findings for research on social capital and complex networks are discussed.

010       Testing time series irreversibility using complex network methods
021       The absence of time-reversal symmetry is a fundamental property of many nonlinear time series. 
020       Here, we propose a new set of statistical tests for time series irreversibility based on standard and horizontal visibility graphs. Specifically, we statistically compare the distributions of time-directed variants of the common complex network measures degree and local clustering coefficient. Our approach does not involve surrogate data and is applicable to relatively short time series. We demonstrate its performance for paradigmatic model systems with known time-reversal properties as well as for picking up signatures of nonlinearity in neuro-physiological data.

010       Unveiling Hidden Communities Through Cascading Detection on Network   Structures
021       Community detection is the process of assigning nodes and links in significant communities (e.g. 
020       clusters, function modules) and its development has led to a better understanding of complex networks. When applied to sizable networks, we argue that most detection algorithms correctly identify prominent communities, but fail to do so across multiple scales. As a result, a significant fraction of the network is left uncharted. We show that this problem stems from larger or denser communities overshadowing smaller or sparser ones, and that this effect accounts for most of the undetected communities and unassigned links. We propose a generic cascading approach to community detection that circumvents the problem. Using real network datasets with two widely used community detection algorithms, we show how cascading detection allows for the detection of the missing communities and results in a significant drop of the fraction of unassigned links.

010       Link Prediction in Complex Networks by Multi Degree   Preferential-Attachment Indices
021       In principle, the rules of links formation of a network model can be considered as a kind of link prediction algorithm. 
020       By revisiting the preferential attachment mechanism for generating a scale-free network, here we propose a class of preferential attachment indices which are different from the previous one. Traditionally, the preferential attachment index is defined by the product of the related nodes degrees, while the new indices will define the similarity score of a pair of nodes by either the maximum in the two nodes degrees or the summarization of their degrees. Extensive experiments are carried out on fourteen real-world networks. Compared with the traditional preferential attachment index, the new ones, especially the degree-summarization similarity index, can provide more accurate prediction on most of the networks. Due to the improved prediction accuracy and low computational complexity, these proposed preferential attachment indices may be of help to provide an instruction for mining unknown links in incomplete networks.

010       Effects of city-size heterogeneity on epidemic spreading in a   metapopulation: A reaction-diffusion approach
021       We review and introduce a generalized reaction-diffusion approach to epidemic spreading in a metapopulation modeled as a complex network. 
020       The metapopulation consists of susceptible and infected individuals that are grouped in subpopulations symbolising cities and villages that are coupled by human travel in a transportation network. By analytic methods and numerical simulations we calculate the fraction of infected people in the metaopoluation in the long time limit, as well as the relevant parameters characterising the epidemic threshold that separates an epidemic from a non-epidemic phase. Within this model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution. Such a system is suited for epidemic modeling where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously in the metapopulation. We find that the heterogeneous conditions cause the epidemic threshold to be a non-trivial function of the reaction rates (local parameters), the network's topology (global parameters) and the cross-over population size that separates "village dynamics" from "city dynamics".

010       Gene-based and semantic structure of the Gene Ontology as a complex   network
021       The last decade has seen the advent and consolidation of ontology based tools for the identification and biological interpretation of classes of genes, such as the Gene Ontology. 
020       The information accumulated time-by-time and included in the GO is encoded in the definition of terms and in the setting up of semantic relations amongst terms. This approach might be usefully complemented by a bottom-up approach based on the knowledge of relationships amongst genes. To this end, we investigate the Gene Ontology from a complex network perspective. We consider the semantic network of terms naturally associated with the semantic relationships provided by the Gene Ontology consortium and a gene-based weighted network in which the nodes are the terms and a link between any two terms is set up whenever genes are annotated in both terms. One aim of the present paper is to understand whether the semantic and the gene-based network share the same structural properties or not. We then consider network communities. The identification of communities in the SVNs network can therefore be the basis of a simple protocol aiming at fully exploiting the possible relationships amongst terms, thus improving the knowledge of the semantic structure of GO. This is also important from a biomedical point of view, as it might reveal how genes over-expressed in a certain term also affect other biological functions not directly linked by the GO semantics. As a by-product, we present a simple methodology that allows to have a first glance insight about the biological characterization of groups of GO terms.

010       Epidemic Threshold of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Model on Complex   Networks
021       We demonstrate that the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on complex networks can have an inactive Griffiths phase characterized by a slow relaxation dynamics. 
020       It contrasts with the mean field theoretical prediction that the SIS model on complex networks is active at any nonzero infection rate. The dynamic fluctuation of infected nodes, ignored in the mean field approach, is responsible for the inactive phase. It is proposed that the question whether the epidemic threshold of the SIS model on complex networks is zero or not can be resolved by the percolation threshold in a model where nodes are occupied in the degree-descending order. Our arguments are supported by the numerical studies on scale-free network models.

010       Information sharing in Quantum Complex Networks
021       We introduce the use of entanglement entropy as a tool for studying the amount of information shared between the nodes of quantum complex networks. 
020       By considering the ground state of a network of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, we compute the information that each node has on the rest of the system. We show that the nodes storing the largest amount of information are not the ones with the highest connectivity, but those with intermediate connectivity thus breaking down the usual hierarchical picture of classical networks. We show both numerically and analytically that the mutual information characterizes the network topology. As a byproduct, our results point out that the amount of information available for an external node connecting to a quantum network allows to determine the network topology.

021       We propose a new measure to characterize the dimension of complex networks based on the ergodic theory of dynamical systems. 
020       This measure is derived from the correlation sum of a trajectory generated by a random walker navigating the network, and extends the classical Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to the context of complex networks. The method is validated with reliable results for both synthetic networks and real-world networks such as the world air-transportation network or urban networks, and provides a computationally fast way for estimating the dimensionality of networks which only relies on the local information provided by the walkers.

020       Different schemes generate different intermediate abstract measures providing additional information, while the composite centrality measure tends to the standard normal distribution. This offers a unified scale to measure node and edge centralities for complex evolving networks under a uniform framework. Considering two real-world cases of the world trade web and the world migration web, both during a time span of 40 years, we propose a standard set-up to demonstrate its remarkable normative power and accuracy. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework for large and arbitrary complex systems, as well as its limitations, through extensive numerical simulations.

010       Utilizing RNA-Seq Data for Cancer Network Inference
021       An important challenge in cancer systems biology is to uncover the complex network of interactions between genes (tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes) implicated in cancer. 
020       Next generation sequencing provides unparalleled ability to probe the expression levels of the entire set of cancer genes and their transcript isoforms. However, there are onerous statistical and computational issues in interpreting high-dimensional sequencing data and inferring the underlying genetic network. In this study, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from a population of 69 human individuals and implemented a probabilistic framework to construct biologically-relevant genetic networks. In particular, we employed a graphical lasso analysis, motivated by considerations of the maximum entropy formalism, to estimate the sparse inverse covariance matrix of RNA-Seq data. Gene ontology, pathway enrichment and protein-protein path length analysis were all carried out to validate the biological context of the predicted network of interacting cancer gene isoforms.

010       Chemical complexity in astrophysical simulations: optimization and   reduction techniques
021       Chemistry has a key role in the evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM), so it is highly desirable to follow its evolution in numerical simulations. 
020       However, it may easily dominate the computational cost when applied to large systems. In this paper we discuss two approaches to reduce these costs: (i) based on computational strategies, and (ii) based on the properties and on the topology of the chemical network. The first methods are more robust, while the second are meant to be giving important information on the structure of large, complex networks. To this aim we first discuss the numerical solvers for integrating the system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) associated with the chemical network. We then propose a buffer method that decreases the computational time spent in solving the ODE system. We further discuss a flux-based method that allows one to determine and then cut on the fly the less active reactions. In addition we also present a topological approach for selecting the most probable species that will be active during the chemical evolution, thus gaining information on the chemical network that otherwise would be difficult to retrieve. This topological technique can also be used as an a priori reduction method for any size network. We implemented these methods into a 1D Lagrangian hydrodynamical code to test their effects: both classes lead to large computational speed-ups, ranging from x2 to x5. We have also tested some hybrid approaches finding that coupling the flux method with a buffer strategy gives the best trade-off between robustness and speed-up of calculations.

010       Remote synchronization reveals network symmetries and functional modules
021       We study a Kuramoto model in which the oscillators are associated with the nodes of a complex network and the interactions include a phase frustration, thus preventing full synchronization. 
020       The system organizes into a regime of remote synchronization where pairs of nodes with the same network symmetry are fully synchronized, despite their distance on the graph. We provide analytical arguments to explain this result and we show how the frustration parameter affects the distribution of phases. An application to brain networks suggests that anatomical symmetry plays a role in neural synchronization by determining correlated functional modules across distant locations.

010       Ranking the Importance of Nodes of Complex Networks by the Equivalence   Classes Approach
021       Identifying the importance of nodes of complex networks is of interest to the research of Social Networks, Biological Networks etc.. 
020       Current researchers have proposed several measures or algorithms, such as betweenness, PageRank and HITS etc., to identify the node importance. However, these measures are based on different aspects of properties of nodes, and often conflict with the others. A reasonable, fair standard is needed for evaluating and comparing these algorithms. This paper develops a framework as the standard for ranking the importance of nodes. Four intuitive rules are suggested to measure the node importance, and the equivalence classes approach is employed to resolve the conflicts and aggregate the results of the rules. To quantitatively compare the algorithms, the performance indicators are also proposed based on a similarity measure. Three widely used real-world networks are used as the test-beds. The experimental results illustrate the feasibility of this framework and show that both algorithms, PageRank and HITS, perform well with bias when dealing with the tested networks. Furthermore, this paper uses the proposed approach to analyze the structure of the Internet, and draws out the kernel of the Internet with dense links.

010       Kuramoto model with frequency-degree correlations on complex networks
021       We study the Kuramoto model on complex networks, in which natural frequencies of phase oscillators and the vertex degrees are correlated. 
020       Using the annealed network approximation and numerical simulations we explore a special case in which the natural frequencies of the oscillators and the vertex degrees are linearly coupled. We find that in uncorrelated scale-free networks with the degree distribution exponent $2 &lt; \gamma &lt; 3$, the model undergoes a first-order phase transition, while the transition becomes of the second order at $\gamma&gt;3$. If $\gamma=3$, the phase synchronization emerges as a result of a hybrid phase transition that combines an abrupt emergence of synchronization, as in first-order phase transitions, and a critical singularity, as in second-order phase transitions. The critical fluctuations manifest themselves as avalanches in synchronization process. Comparing our analytical calculations with numerical simulations for Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi and scale-free networks, we demonstrate that the annealed network approach is accurate if the the mean degree and size of the network are sufficiently large. We also study analytically and numerically the Kuramoto model on star graphs and find that if the natural frequency of the central oscillator is sufficiently large in comparison to the average frequency of its neighbors, then synchronization emerges as a result of a first-order phase transition. This shows that oscillators sitting at hubs in a network may generate a discontinuous synchronization transition.

010       Edge Balance Ratio: Power Law from Vertices to Edges in Directed Complex   Network
021       Power law distribution is common in real-world networks including online social networks. 
020       Many studies on complex networks focus on the characteristics of vertices, which are always proved to follow the power law. However, few researches have been done on edges in directed networks. In this paper, edge balance ratio is firstly proposed to measure the balance property of edges in directed networks. Based on edge balance ratio, balance profile and positivity are put forward to describe the balance level of the whole network. Then the distribution of edge balance ratio is theoretically analyzed. In a directed network whose vertex in-degree follows the power law with scaling exponent $\gamma$, it is proved that the edge balance ratio follows a piecewise power law, with the scaling exponent of each section linearly dependents on $\gamma$. The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the theoretical analysis is confirmed by statistics of real-world online social networks, including Twitter network with 35 million users and Sina Weibo network with 110 million users.

010       Modelling Multi-Trait Scale-free Networks by Optimization
021       Recently, one paper in Nature(Papadopoulos, 2012) raised an old debate on the origin of the scale-free property of complex networks, which focuses on whether the scale-free property origins from the optimization or not. 
020       Because the real-world complex networks often have multiple traits, any explanation on the scale-free property of complex networks should be capable of explaining the other traits as well. This paper proposed a framework which can model multi-trait scale-free networks based on optimization, and used three examples to demonstrate its effectiveness. The results suggested that the optimization is a more generalized explanation because it can not only explain the origin of the scale-free property, but also the origin of the other traits in a uniform way. This paper provides a universal method to get ideal networks for the researches such as epidemic spreading and synchronization on complex networks.

010       Modelling cytoskeletal traffic: an interplay between passive diffusion   and active transport
021       We introduce the totally asymmetric exclusion process with Langmuir kinetics (TASEP-LK) on a network as a microscopic model for active motor protein transport on the cytoskeleton, immersed in the diffusive cytoplasm. 
020       We discuss how the interplay between active transport along a network and infinite diffusion in a bulk reservoir leads to a heterogeneous matter distribution on various scales. We find three regimes for steady state transport, corresponding to the scale of the network, of individual segments or local to sites. At low exchange rates strong density heterogeneities develop between different segments in the network. In this regime one has to consider the topological complexity of the whole network to describe transport. In contrast, at moderate exchange rates the transport through the network decouples, and the physics is determined by single segments and the local topology. At last, for very high exchange rates the homogeneous Langmuir process dominates the stationary state. We introduce effective rate diagrams for the network to identify these different regimes. Based on this method we develop an intuitive but generic picture of how the stationary state of excluded volume processes on complex networks can be understood in terms of the single-segment phase diagram.

010       Multiscale Community Mining in Networks Using Spectral Graph Wavelets
021       For data represented by networks, the community structure of the underlying graph is of great interest. 
020       A classical clustering problem is to uncover the overall ``best'' partition of nodes in communities. Here, a more elaborate description is proposed in which community structures are identified at different scales. To this end, we take advantage of the local and scale-dependent information encoded in graph wavelets. After new developments for the practical use of graph wavelets, studying proper scale boundaries and parameters and introducing scaling functions, we propose a method to mine for communities in complex networks in a scale-dependent manner. It relies on classifying nodes according to their wavelets or scaling functions, using a scale-dependent modularity function. An example on a graph benchmark having hierarchical communities shows that we estimate successfully its multiscale structure.

010       Phase transition of light on complex quantum networks
021       Recent advances in quantum optics and atomic physics allow for an unprecedented level of control over light-matter interactions, which can be exploited to investigate new physical phenomena. 
020       In this work we are interested in the role played by the topology of quantum networks describing coupled optical cavities and local atomic degrees of freedom. In particular, using a mean-field approximation, we study the phase diagram of the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model on complex networks topologies, and we characterize the transition between a Mott-like phase of localized polaritons and a superfluid phase. We found that, for complex topologies, the phase diagram is non-trivial and well defined in the thermodynamic limit only if the hopping coefficient scales like the inverse of the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network. Furthermore we provide numerical evidences that, for some complex network topologies, this scaling implies an asymptotically vanishing hopping coefficient in the limit of large network sizes. The latter result suggests the interesting possibility of observing quantum phase transitions of light on complex quantum networks even with very small couplings between the optical cavities.

010       Study of a Market Model with Conservative Exchanges on Complex Networks
021       Many models of market dynamics make use of the idea of conservative wealth exchanges among economic agents. 
020       A few years ago an exchange model using extremal dynamics was developed and a very interesting result was obtained: a self-generated minimum wealth or poverty line. On the other hand, the wealth distribution exhibited an exponential shape as a function of the square of the wealth. These results have been obtained both considering exchanges between nearest neighbors or in a mean field scheme. In the present paper we study the effect of distributing the agents on a complex network. We have considered archetypical complex networks: Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi random networks and scale-free networks. The presence of a poverty line with finite wealth is preserved but spatial correlations are important, particularly between the degree of the node and the wealth. We present a detailed study of the correlations, as well as the changes in the Gini coefficient, that measures the inequality, as a function of the type and average degree of the considered networks.

010       Competition between surface relaxation and ballistic deposition models   in scale free networks
021       In this paper we study the scaling behavior of the fluctuations in the steady state $W_S$ with the system size $N$ for a surface growth process given by the competition between the surface relaxation (SRM) and the Ballistic Deposition (BD) models on degree uncorrelated Scale Free networks (SF), characterized by a degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, where $k$ is the degree of a node. 
020       It is known that the fluctuations of the SRM model above the critical dimension ($d_c=2$) scales logarithmically with $N$ on euclidean lattices. However, Pastore y Piontti {\it et. al.} [A. L. Pastore y Piontti {\it et. al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 046117 (2007)] found that the fluctuations of the SRM model in SF networks scale logarithmically with $N$ for $\lambda &lt;3$ and as a constant for $\lambda \geq 3$. In this letter we found that for a pure ballistic deposition model on SF networks $W_S$ scales as a power law with an exponent that depends on $\lambda$. On the other hand when both processes are in competition, we find that there is a continuous crossover between a SRM behavior and a power law behavior due to the BD model that depends on the occurrence probability of each process and the system size. Interestingly, we find that a relaxation process contaminated by any small contribution of ballistic deposition will behave, for increasing system sizes, as a pure ballistic one. Our findings could be relevant when surface relaxation mechanisms are used to synchronize processes that evolve on top of complex networks.

010       Emergence of network features from multiplexity
021       Many biological and man-made networked systems are characterized by the simultaneous presence of different sub-networks organized in separate layers, with links and nodes of qualitatively different types. 
020       While during the past few years theoretical studies have examined a variety of structural features of complex networks, the outstanding question is whether such features are characterizing all single layers, or rather emerge as a result of coarse-graining, i.e. when going from the multilayered to the aggregate network representation. Here we address this issue with the help of real data. We analyze the structural properties of an intrinsically multilayered real network, the European Air Transportation Multiplex Network in which each commercial airline defines a network layer. We examine how several structural measures evolve as layers are progressively merged together. In particular, we discuss how the topology of each layer affects the emergence of structural properties in the aggregate network.

010       Effect of Coupling on the Epidemic Threshold in Interconnected Complex   Networks: A Spectral Analysis
021       In epidemic modeling, the term infection strength indicates the ratio of infection rate and cure rate. 
020       If the infection strength is higher than a certain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the epidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a single generic graph representing the contact network of the population under consideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of the spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it is not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some interconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact network. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited to homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this paper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a given network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with fixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the interconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph theory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks. These results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and control. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.

010       Growing Random Geometric Graph Models of Super-linear Scaling Law
021       Recent researches on complex systems highlighted the so-called super-linear growth phenomenon. 
020       As the system size $P$ measured as population in cities or active users in online communities increases, the total activities $X$ measured as GDP or number of new patents, crimes in cities generated by these people also increases but in a faster rate. This accelerating growth phenomenon can be well described by a super-linear power law $X \propto P^{\gamma}$($\gamma&gt;1$). However, the explanation on this phenomenon is still lack. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework called growing random geometric models to explain the super-linear relationship. A growing network is constructed on an abstract geometric space. The new coming node can only survive if it just locates on an appropriate place in the space where other nodes exist, then new edges are connected with the adjacent nodes whose number is determined by the density of existing nodes. Thus the total number of edges can grow with the number of nodes in a faster speed exactly following the super-linear power law. The models cannot only reproduce a lot of observed phenomena in complex networks, e.g., scale-free degree distribution and asymptotically size-invariant clustering coefficient, but also resemble the known patterns of cities, such as fractal growing, area-population and diversity-population scaling relations, etc. Strikingly, only one important parameter, the dimension of the geometric space, can really influence the super-linear growth exponent $\gamma$.

010       Core organization of directed complex networks
021       The recursive removal of leaves (dead end vertices) and their neighbors from an undirected network results, when this pruning algorithm stops, in a so-called core of the network. 
020       This specific subgraph should be distinguished from $k$-cores, which are principally different subgraphs in networks. If the vertex mean degree of a network is sufficiently large, the core is a giant cluster containing a finite fraction of vertices. We find that generalization of this pruning algorithm to directed networks provides a significantly more complex picture of cores. By implementing a rate equation approach to this pruning procedure for directed uncorrelated networks, we identify a set of cores progressively embedded into each other in a network and describe their birth points and structure.

010       Random walks on weighted networks
021       Random walks constitute a fundamental mechanism for a large set of dynamics taking place on networks. 
020       In this article, we study random walks on weighted networks with an arbitrary degree distribution, where the weight of an edge between two nodes has a tunable parameter. By using the spectral graph theory, we derive analytical expressions for the stationary distribution, mean first-passage time (MFPT), average trapping time (ATT), and lower bound of the ATT, which is defined as the average MFPT to a given node over every starting point chosen from the stationary distribution. All these results depend on the weight parameter, indicating a significant role of network weights on random walks. For the case of uncorrelated networks, we provide explicit formulas for the stationary distribution as well as ATT. Particularly, for uncorrelated scale-free networks, when the target is placed on a node with the highest degree, we show that ATT can display various scalings of network size, depending also on the same parameter. Our findings could pave a way to delicately controlling random-walk dynamics on complex networks.

010       Crossover from weak to strong disorder regime in the duration of   epidemics
021       We study the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model in complex networks, considering that not all individuals in the population interact in the same way between them. 
020       This heterogeneity between contacts is modeled by a continuous disorder. In our model the disorder represents the contact time or the closeness between individuals. We find that the duration time of an epidemic has a crossover with the system size, from a power law regime to a logarithmic regime depending on the transmissibility related to the strength of the disorder. Using percolation theory, we find that the duration of the epidemic scales as the average length of the branches of the infection. Our theoretical findings, supported by simulations, explains the crossover between the two regimes.

010       All-time dynamics of continuous-time random walks on complex networks
021       The concept of continuous-time random walks (CTRW) is a generalization of ordinary random walk models, and it is a powerful tool for investigating a broad spectrum of phenomena in natural, engineering, social and economic sciences. 
020       Recently, several theoretical approaches have been developed that allowed to analyze explicitly dynamics of CTRW at all times, which is critically important for understanding mechanisms of underlying phenomena. However, theoretical analysis has been done mostly for systems with a simple geometry. Here we extend the original method based on generalized master equations to analyze all-time dynamics of CTRW models on complex networks. Specific calculations are performed for models on lattices with branches and for models on coupled parallel-chain lattices. Exact expressions for velocities and dispersions are obtained. Generalized fluctuations theorems for CTRW models on complex networks are discussed.

010       A generalized theory of preferential linking
021       There are diverse mechanisms driving the evolution of social networks. 
020       A key open question dealing with understanding their evolution is: How various preferential linking mechanisms produce networks with different features? In this paper we first empirically study preferential linking phenomena in an evolving online social network, find and validate the linear preference. We propose an analyzable model which captures the real growth process of the network and reveals the underlying mechanism dominating its evolution. Furthermore based on preferential linking we propose a generalized model reproducing the evolution of online social networks, present unified analytical results describing network characteristics for 27 preference scenarios, and explore the relation between preferential linking mechanism and network features. We find that within the framework of preferential linking analytical degree distributions can only be the combinations of finite kinds of functions which are related to rational, logarithmic and inverse tangent functions, and extremely complex network structure will emerge even for very simple sublinear preferential linking. This work not only provides a verifiable origin for the emergence of various network characteristics in social networks, but bridges the micro individuals' behaviors and the global organization of social networks.

010       Surprise maximization reveals the community structure of complex   networks
021       How to determine the community structure of complex networks is an open question. 
020       It is critical to establish the best strategies for community detection in networks of unknown structure. Here, using standard synthetic benchmarks, we show that none of the algorithms hitherto developed for community structure characterization perform optimally. Significantly, evaluating the results according to their modularity, the most popular measure of the quality of a partition, systematically provides mistaken solutions. However, a novel quality function, called Surprise, can be used to elucidate which is the optimal division into communities. Consequently, we show that the best strategy to find the community structure of all the networks examined involves choosing among the solutions provided by multiple algorithms the one with the highest Surprise value. We conclude that Surprise maximization precisely reveals the community structure of complex networks.

010       MANCaLog: A Logic for Multi-Attribute Network Cascades (Technical   Report)
021       The modeling of cascade processes in multi-agent systems in the form of complex networks has in recent years become an important topic of study due to its many applications: the adoption of commercial products, spread of disease, the diffusion of an idea, etc. 
020       In this paper, we begin by identifying a desiderata of seven properties that a framework for modeling such processes should satisfy: the ability to represent attributes of both nodes and edges, an explicit representation of time, the ability to represent non-Markovian temporal relationships, representation of uncertain information, the ability to represent competing cascades, allowance of non-monotonic diffusion, and computational tractability. We then present the MANCaLog language, a formalism based on logic programming that satisfies all these desiderata, and focus on algorithms for finding minimal models (from which the outcome of cascades can be obtained) as well as how this formalism can be applied in real world scenarios. We are not aware of any other formalism in the literature that meets all of the above requirements.

010       Cliques in complex networks reveal link formation and community   evolution
021       Missing link prediction in indirected and un-weighted network is an open and challenge problem which has been studied intensively in recent years. 
020       In this paper, we studied the relationships between community structure and link formation and proposed a Fast Block probabilistic Model(FBM). In accordance with the experiments on four real world networks, we have yielded very good accuracy of missing link prediction and huge improvement in computing efficiency compared to conventional methods. By analyzing the mechanism of link formation, we also discovered that clique structure plays a significant role to help us understand how links grow in communities. Therefore, we summarized three principles which are proved to be able to well explain the mechanism of link formation and network evolution from the theory of graph topology.

010       Node-weighted interacting network measures improve the representation of   real-world complex systems
021       Network theory provides a rich toolbox consisting of methods, measures, and models for studying the structure and dynamics of complex systems found in nature, society, or technology. 
020       Recently, it has been pointed out that many real-world complex systems are more adequately mapped by networks of interacting or interdependent networks, e.g., a power grid showing interdependency with a communication network. Additionally, in many real-world situations it is reasonable to include node weights into complex network statistics to reflect the varying size or importance of subsystems that are represented by nodes in the network of interest. E.g., nodes can represent vastly different surface area in climate networks, volume in brain networks or economic capacity in trade networks. In this letter, combining both ideas, we derive a novel class of statistical measures for analysing the structure of networks of interacting networks with heterogeneous node weights. Using a prototypical spatial network model, we show that the newly introduced node-weighted interacting network measures indeed provide an improved representation of the underlying system's properties as compared to their unweighted analogues. We apply our method to study the complex network structure of cross-boundary trade between European Union (EU) and non-EU countries finding that it provides important information on trade balance and economic robustness.

010       Geometric signature of complex synchronisation scenarios
021       Synchronisation between coupled oscillatory systems is a common phenomenon in many natural as well as technical systems. 
020       Varying the strength of coupling often leads to qualitative changes in the complex dynamics of the mutually coupled systems including different types of synchronisation such as phase, lag, generalised, or even complete synchronisation. Here, we study the geometric signatures of coupling along with the onset of generalised synchronisation between two coupled chaotic oscillators by mapping the systems' individual as well as joint recurrences in phase space to a complex network. For a paradigmatic continuous-time model system, the transitivity properties of the resulting joint recurrence networks display distinct variations associated with changes in the structural similarity between different parts of the considered trajectories. They therefore provide a useful indicator for the emergence of generalised synchronisation. <br />This paper is dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the introduction of recurrence plots by Eckmann et al. (Europhys. Lett. 4 (1987), 973).

010       Coupling between time series: a network view
021       Recently, the visibility graph has been introduced as a novel view for analyzing time series, which maps it to a complex network. 
020       In this paper, we introduce new algorithm of visibility, "cross-visibility", which reveals the conjugation of two coupled time series. The correspondence between the two time series is mapped to a network, "the cross-visibility graph", to demonstrate the correlation between them. We applied the algorithm to several correlated and uncorrelated time series, generated by the linear stationary ARFIMA process. The results demonstrate that the cross-visibility graph associated with correlated time series with power-law auto-correlation is scale-free. If the time series are uncorrelated, the degree distribution of their cross-visibility network deviates from power-law. For more clarifying the process, we applied the algorithm to real-world data from the financial trades of two companies, and observed significant small-scale coupling in their dynamics.

010       Phase transitions in a complex network
021       We study a mean field model of a complex network, focusing on edge and triangle densities. 
020       Our first result is the derivation of a variational characterization of the entropy density, compatible with the infinite node limit. We then determine the optimizing graphs for small triangle density and a range of edge density, though we can only prove they are local, not global, maxima of the entropy density. With this assumption we then prove that the resulting entropy density must lose its analyticity in various regimes. In particular this implies the existence of a phase transition between distinct heterogeneous multipartite phases at low triangle density, and a phase transition between these phases and the disordered phase at high triangle density.

010       Slow epidemic extinction in populations with heterogeneous infection   rates
021       We explore how heterogeneity in the intensity of interactions between people affects epidemic spreading. 
020       For that, we study the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on a complex network, where a link connecting individuals $i$ and $j$ is endowed with an infection rate $\beta_{ij} = \lambda w_{ij}$ proportional to the intensity of their contact $w_{ij}$, with a distribution $P(w_{ij})$ taken from face-to-face experiments analyzed in Cattuto $et\;al.$ (PLoS ONE 5, e11596, 2010). We find an extremely slow decay of the fraction of infected individuals, for a wide range of the control parameter $\lambda$. Using a distribution of width $a$ we identify two large regions in the $a-\lambda$ space with anomalous behaviors, which are reminiscent of rare region effects (Griffiths phases) found in models with quenched disorder. We show that the slow approach to extinction is caused by isolated small groups of highly interacting individuals, which keep epidemic alive for very long times. A mean-field approximation and a percolation approach capture with very good accuracy the absorbing-active transition line for weak (small $a$) and strong (large $a$) disorder, respectively.

010       Evolutionary dynamics of group interactions on structured populations: A   review
021       Interactions among living organisms, from bacteria colonies to human societies, are inherently more complex than interactions among particles and nonliving matter. 
020       Group interactions are a particularly important and widespread class, representative of which is the public goods game. In addition, methods of statistical physics have proven valuable for studying pattern formation, equilibrium selection, and self-organisation in evolutionary games. Here we review recent advances in the study of evolutionary dynamics of group interactions on structured populations, including lattices, complex networks and coevolutionary models. We also compare these results with those obtained on well-mixed populations. The review particularly highlights that the study of the dynamics of group interactions, like several other important equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamical processes in biological, economical and social sciences, benefits from the synergy between statistical physics, network science and evolutionary game theory.

010       Structural and topological phase transitions on the German Stock   Exchange
021       We find numerical and empirical evidence for dynamical, structural and topological phase transitions on the (German) Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) in the temporal vicinity of the worldwide financial crash. 
020       Using the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) technique, a particularly useful canonical tool of the graph theory, two transitions of the topology of a complex network representing FSE were found. First transition is from a hierarchical scale-free MST representing the stock market before the recent worldwide financial crash, to a superstar-like MST decorated by a scale-free hierarchy of trees representing the market's state for the period containing the crash. Subsequently, a transition is observed from this transient, (meta)stable state of the crash, to a hierarchical scale-free MST decorated by several star-like trees after the worldwide financial crash. The phase transitions observed are analogous to the ones we obtained earlier for the Warsaw Stock Exchange and more pronounced than those found by Onnela-Chakraborti-Kaski-Kert\'esz for S&amp;P 500 index in the vicinity of Black Monday (October 19, 1987) and also in the vicinity of January 1, 1998. Our results provide an empirical foundation for the future theory of dynamical, structural and topological phase transitions on financial markets.

010       Inducing Effect on the Percolation Transition in Complex Networks
021       Percolation theory concerns the emergence of connected clusters that percolate through a networked system. 
020       Previous studies ignored the effect that a node outside the percolating cluster may actively induce its inside neighbours to exit the percolating cluster. Here we study this inducing effect on the classical site percolation and K-core percolation, showing that the inducing effect always causes a discontinuous percolation transition. We precisely predict the percolation threshold and core size for uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. For low-dimensional lattices the percolation threshold fluctuates considerably over realizations, yet we can still predict the core size once the percolation occurs. The core sizes of real-world networks can also be well predicted using degree distribution as the only input. Our work therefore provides a theoretical framework for quantitatively understanding discontinuous breakdown phenomena in various complex systems.

010       Likelihood Computations Using Value Abstractions
021       In this paper, we use evidence-specific value abstraction for speeding Bayesian networks inference. 
020       This is done by grouping variable values and treating the combined values as a single entity. As we show, such abstractions can exploit regularities in conditional probability distributions and also the specific values of observed variables. To formally justify value abstraction, we define the notion of safe value abstraction and devise inference algorithms that use it to reduce the cost of inference. Our procedure is particularly useful for learning complex networks with many hidden variables. In such cases, repeated likelihood computations are required for EM or other parameter optimization techniques. Since these computations are repeated with respect to the same evidence set, our methods can provide significant speedup to the learning procedure. We demonstrate the algorithm on genetic linkage problems where the use of value abstraction sometimes differentiates between a feasible and non-feasible solution.

010       Optimal synchronizability of bearings
021       Bearings are mechanical dissipative systems that, when perturbed, relax toward a synchronized (bearing) state. 
020       Here we find that bearings can be perceived as physical realizations of complex networks of oscillators with asymmetrically weighted couplings. Accordingly, these networks can exhibit optimal synchronization properties through fine tuning of the local interaction strength as a function of node degree [Motter, Zhou, and Kurths, Phys. Rev. E 71, 016116 (2005)]. We show that, in analogy, the synchronizability of bearings can be maximized by counterbalancing the number of contacts and the inertia of their constituting rotor disks through the mass-radius relation, $m\sim r^{\alpha}$, with an optimal exponent $\alpha=\alpha_{\times}$ which converges to unity for a large number of rotors. Under this condition, and regardless of the presence of a long-tailed distribution of disk radii composing the mechanical system, the average participation per disk is maximized and the energy dissipation rate is homogeneously distributed among elementary rotors.

010       Transparency effect in the emergence of monopolies in social networks
021       Power law degree distribution was shown in many complex networks. 
020       However, in most real systems, deviation from power-law behavior is observed in social and economical networks and emergence of giant hubs is obvious in real network structures far from the tail of power law. We propose a model based on the information transparency (transparency means how much the information is obvious to others). This model can explain power structure in societies with non-transparency in information delivery. The emergence of ultra powerful nodes is explained as a direct result of censorship. Based on these assumptions, we define four distinct transparency regions: perfect non-transparent, low transparent, perfect transparent and exaggerated regions. We observe the emergence of some ultra powerful (very high degree) nodes in low transparent networks, in accordance with the economical and social systems. We show that the low transparent networks are more vulnerable to attacks and the controllability of low transparent networks is harder than the others. Also, the ultra powerful nodes in the low transparent networks have a smaller mean length and higher clustering coefficients than the other regions.

010       Canalization and control in automata networks: body segmentation in   Drosophila melanogaster
021       We present schema redescription as a methodology to characterize canalization in automata networks used to model biochemical regulation and signalling. 
020       In our formulation, canalization becomes synonymous with redundancy present in the logic of automata. This results in straightforward measures to quantify canalization in an automaton (micro-level), which is in turn integrated into a highly scalable framework to characterize the collective dynamics of large-scale automata networks (macro-level). This way, our approach provides a method to link micro- to macro-level dynamics -- a crux of complexity. Several new results ensue from this methodology: uncovering of dynamical modularity (modules in the dynamics rather than in the structure of networks), identification of minimal conditions and critical nodes to control the convergence to attractors, simulation of dynamical behaviour from incomplete information about initial conditions, and measures of macro-level canalization and robustness to perturbations. We exemplify our methodology with a well-known model of the intra- and inter cellular genetic regulation of body segmentation in Drosophila melanogaster. We use this model to show that our analysis does not contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about its behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor basin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal conditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the resilience of these to stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable to any complex network that can be modelled using automata, but we focus on biochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the (decentralized) control that orchestrates cellular activity -- with the ultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues 'compute'.

010       Network Observability Transitions
021       In the modeling, monitoring, and control of complex networks, a fundamental problem concerns the comprehensive determination of the state of the system from limited measurements. 
020       Using power grids as example networks, we show that this problem leads to a new type of percolation transition, here termed a {\it network observability transition}, which we solve analytically for the configuration model. We also demonstrate a dual role of the network's community structure, which both facilitates optimal measurement placement and renders the networks substantially more sensitive to `observability attacks'. Aside from their immediate implications for the development of smart grids, these results provide insights into decentralized biological, social, and technological networks.

010       Quasiuniversal connectedness percolation of polydisperse rod systems
021       The connectedness percolation threshold (eta_c) and critical coordination number (Z_c) of systems of penetrable spherocylinders characterized by a length polydispersity are studied by way of Monte Carlo simulations for several aspect ratio distributions. 
020       We find that (i) \eta_c is a nearly universal function of the weight-averaged aspect ratio, with an approximate inverse dependence that extends to aspect ratios that are well below the slender rod limit and (ii) that percolation of impenetrable spherocylinders displays a similar quasiuniversal behavior. For systems with a sufficiently high degree of polydispersity, we find that Z_c can become smaller than unity, in analogy with observations reported for generalized and complex networks.

010       Topological strata of weighted complex networks
021       The statistical mechanical approach to complex networks is the dominant paradigm in describing natural and societal complex systems. 
020       The study of network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge weights and --more recently-- correlations between neighboring nodes. However, statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks. Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods to complex systems.

010       Dynamic structural and topological phase transitions on the Warsaw Stock   Exchange: A phenomenological approach
021       We study the crash dynamics of the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) by using the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) networks. 
020       We find the transition of the complex network during its evolution from a (hierarchical) power law MST network, representing the stable state of WSE before the recent worldwide financial crash, to a superstar-like (or superhub) MST network of the market decorated by a hierarchy of trees (being, perhaps, an unstable, intermediate market state). Subsequently, we observed a transition from this complex tree to the topology of the (hierarchical) power law MST network decorated by several star-like trees or hubs. This structure and topology represent, perhaps, the WSE after the worldwide financial crash, and could be considered to be an aftershock. Our results can serve as an empirical foundation for a future theory of dynamic structural and topological phase transitions on financial markets.

010       Design and Simulation of IOTA - a Novel Concept of Integrable Optics   Test Accelerator
021       The use of nonlinear lattices with large betatron tune spreads can increase instability and space charge thresholds due to improved Landau damping. 
020       Unfortunately, the majority of nonlinear accelerator lattices turn out to be nonintegrable, producing chaotic motion and a complex network of stable and unstable resonances. Recent advances in finding the integrable nonlinear accelerator lattices have led to a proposal to construct at Fermilab a test accelerator with strong nonlinear focusing which avoids resonances and chaotic particle motion. This presentation will outline the main challenges, theoretical design solutions and construction status of the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator underway at Fermilab.

010       Slow dynamics of the contact process on complex networks
021       The Contact Process has been studied on complex networks exhibiting different kinds of quenched disorder. 
020       Numerical evidence is found for Griffiths phases and other rare region effects, in Erd\H os R\'enyi networks, leading rather generically to anomalously slow (algebraic, logarithmic,...) relaxation. More surprisingly, it turns out that Griffiths phases can also emerge in the absence of quenched disorder, as a consequence of sole topological heterogeneity in networks with finite topological dimension. In case of scale-free networks, exhibiting infinite topological dimension, slow dynamics can be observed on tree-like structures and a superimposed weight pattern. In the infinite size limit the correlated subspaces of vertices seem to cause a smeared phase transition. These results have a broad spectrum of implications for propagation phenomena and other dynamical process on networks and are relevant for the analysis of both models and empirical data.

010       Centrality-constrained graph embedding
021       Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. 
020       Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates a graph embedding approach with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm converges, and can be used to efficiently embed large graphs on the order of thousands of nodes.

010       Experiments on autonomous Boolean networks
021       We realize autonomous Boolean networks by using logic gates in their autonomous mode-of-operation on a field-programmable gate array. 
020       This allows us to implement time-continuous systems with complex dynamical behaviors that can be conveniently interconnected into large-scale networks with flexible topologies that consist of time-delay links and a large number of nodes. We demonstrate how we realize networks with periodic, chaotic, and excitable dynamics and study their properties. Field-programmable gate arrays define a new experimental paradigm that holds great potential to test a large body of theoretical results on the dynamics of complex networks, which has been beyond reach of traditional experimental approaches.

010       Structure-dynamics relationship in coherent transport through disordered   systems
021       Quantum transport is strongly influenced by interference with phase relations that depend sensitively on the scattering medium. 
020       Since even small changes in the geometry of the medium can turn constructive interference to destructive, a clear relation between structure and fast, efficient transport is difficult to identify. Here we present a complex network analysis of quantum transport through disordered systems to elucidate the relationship between transport efficiency and structural organization. Evidence is provided for the emergence of structural classes with different geometries but similar high efficiency. Specifically, a structural motif characterised by pair sites which are not actively participating to the dynamics renders transport properties robust against perturbations. Our results pave the way for a systematic rationalization of the design principles behind highly efficient transport which is of paramount importance for technological applications as well as to address transport robustness in natural light harvesting complexes.

010       The transition towards immortality: non-linear autocatalytic growth of   citations to scientific papers
021       We discuss microscopic mechanisms of complex network growth, with the special emphasis of how these mechanisms can be evaluated from the measurements on real networks. 
020       As an example we consider the network of citations to scientific papers. Contrary to common belief that its growth is determined by the linear preferential attachment, our microscopic measurements show that it is driven by the nonlinear autocatalytic growth. This invalidates the scale-free hypothesis for the citation network. The nonlinearity is responsible for a dramatic dynamical phase transition: while the citation lifetime of majority of papers is 6-10 years, the highly-cited papers have practically infinite lifetime.

010       Parallel and distributed optimization methods for estimation and control   in networks
021       System performance for networks composed of interconnected subsystems can be increased if the traditionally separated subsystems are jointly optimized. 
020       Recently, parallel and distributed optimization methods have emerged as a powerful tool for solving estimation and control problems in large-scale networked systems. In this paper we review and analyze the optimization-theoretic concepts of parallel and distributed methods for solving coupled optimization problems and demonstrate how several estimation and control problems related to complex networked systems can be formulated in these settings. The paper presents a systematic framework for exploiting the potential of the decomposition structures as a way to obtain different parallel algorithms, each with a different tradeoff among convergence speed, message passing amount and distributed computation architecture. Several specific applications from estimation and process control are included to demonstrate the power of the approach.

010       Connectivity-Driven Coherence in Complex Networks
021       We study the emergence of coherence in complex networks of mutually coupled non-identical elements. 
020       We uncover the precise dependence of the dynamical coherence on the network connectivity, on the isolated dynamics of the elements and the coupling function. These findings predict that in random graphs, the enhancement of coherence is proportional to the mean degree. In locally connected networks, coherence is no longer controlled by the mean degree, but rather on how the mean degree scales with the network size. In these networks, even when the coherence is absent, adding a fraction s of random connections leads to an enhancement of coherence proportional to s. Our results provide a way to control the emergent properties by the manipulation of the dynamics of the elements and the network connectivity.

010       Assessment of urban ecosystem resilience using the efficiency of hybrid   social-physical complex networks
021       One of the most important tasks of urban and hazard planning is to mitigate the damages and minimize the costs of the recovery process after catastrophic events. 
020       The rapidity and the efficiency of the recovery process are commonly referred to as resilience. Despite the problem of resilience quantification has received a lot of attention, a mathematical definition of the resilience of an urban community, which takes into account the social aspects of a urban environment, has not yet been identified. In this paper we provide and test a methodology for the assessment of urban resilience to catastrophic events which aims at bridging the gap between the engineering and the ecosystem approaches to resilience. We propose to model a urban system by means of different hybrid social-physical complex networks, obtained by enriching the urban street network with additional information about the social and physical constituents of a city, namely citizens, residential buildings and services. Then, we introduce a class of efficiency measures on these hybrid networks, inspired by the definition of global efficiency given in complex network theory, and we show that these measures can be effectively used to quantify the resilience of a urban system, by comparing their respective values before and after a catastrophic event and during the reconstruction process. As a case study, we consider simulated earthquakes in the city of Acerra, Italy, and we use these efficiency measures to compare the ability of different reconstruction strategies in restoring the original performance of the urban system.

010       Critical phenomena in the dynamical visibility graph
021       We have investigated the time series by the mapping them to the complex network. 
020       We have studied the behavior of the relative number of clusters in dynamic visibility graphs near the critical value of the angle of view. Time series of different nature both artificial and experimental were numerically investigated. In all cases, the dependence of the relative number of clusters on the proximity to the critical angle of view had a power law behavior. Thus, it was shown that there is a similarity between the behavior of the relative number of clusters and the order parameter in the second-order phase transition theory and percolation theory. Each time series is characterized by its own value of the critical index - an analog of the critical index in second-order phase transition theory.

010       Phase transitions in the Potts model on complex networks
021       The Potts model is one of the most popular spin models of statistical physics. 
020       The prevailing majority of work done so far corresponds to the lattice version of the model. However, many natural or man-made systems are much better described by the topology of a network. We consider the q-state Potts model on an uncorrelated scale-free network for which the node-degree distribution manifests a power-law decay governed by the exponent \lambda. We work within the mean-field approximation, since for systems on random uncorrelated scale-free networks this method is known to often give asymptotically exact results. Depending on particular values of q and \lambda one observes either a first-order or a second-order phase transition or the system is ordered at any finite temperature. In a case study, we consider the limit q=1 (percolation) and find a correspondence between the magnetic exponents and those describing percolation on a scale-free network. Interestingly, logarithmic corrections to scaling appear at \lambda=4 in this case.

010       Correlations in complex networks under attack
021       For any initial correlated network after any kind of attack where either nodes or edges are removed, we obtain general expressions for the degree-degree probability matrix and degree distribution. 
020       We show that the proposed analytical approach predicts the correct topological changes after the attack by comparing the evolution of the assortativity coefficient for different attack strategies and intensities in theory and simulations. We find that it is possible to turn an initial assortative network into a disassortative one, and vice versa, by fine-tuning removal of either nodes or edges. For an initial uncorrelated network, on the other hand, we discover that only a targeted edge-removal attack can induce such correlations.

010       Interplay between Network Topology and Dynamics in Neural Systems
021       This thesis is a compendium of research which brings together ideas from the fields of Complex Networks and Computational Neuroscience to address two questions regarding neural systems: <br />1) How the activity of neurons, via synaptic changes, can shape the topology of the network they form part of, and <br />2) How the resulting network structure, in its turn, might condition aspects of brain behaviour. 
020       <br />Although the emphasis is on neural networks, several theoretical findings which are relevant for complex networks in general are presented -- such as a method for studying network evolution as a stochastic process, or a theory that allows for ensembles of correlated networks, and sets of dynamical elements thereon, to be treated mathematically and computationally in a model-independent manner. Some of the results are used to explain experimental data -- certain properties of brain tissue, the spontaneous emergence of correlations in all kinds of networks... -- and predictions regarding statistical aspects of the central nervous system are made. The mechanism of Cluster Reverberation is proposed to account for the near-instant storage of novel information the brain is capable of.

010       Note on the Complex Networks and Epidemiology Part I: Complex Networks
021       Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society. 
020       Frequently cited examples include Internet, WWW, a network of chemicals linked by chemical reactions, social relationship networks, citation networks, etc. The research of complex networks has attracted many scientists' attention. Physicists have shown that these networks exhibit some surprising characters, such as high clustering coefficient, small diameter, and the absence of the thresholds of percolation. Scientists in mathematical epidemiology discovered that the threshold of infectious disease disappears on contact networks that following Scale-Free distribution. Researchers in economics and public health also find that the imitation behavior could lead to cluster phenomena of vaccination and un-vaccination. In this note, we will review the basic concepts of complex networks; Basic epidemic models; the development of complex networks and epidemiology.

010       On time-varying collaboration networks
021       The patterns of scientific collaboration have been frequently investigated in terms of complex networks without reference to time evolution. 
020       In the present work, we derive collaborative networks (from the arXiv repository) parameterized along time. By defining the concept of affine group, we identify several interesting trends in scientific collaboration, including the fact that the average size of the affine groups grows exponentially, while the number of authors increases as a power law. We were therefore able to identify, through extrapolation, the possible date when a single affine group is expected to emerge. Characteristic collaboration patterns were identified for each researcher, and their analysis revealed that larger affine groups tend to be less stable.

010       Three-feature model to reproduce the topology of citation networks and   the effects from authors&#x27; visibility on their h-index
021       Various factors are believed to govern the selection of references in citation networks, but a precise, quantitative determination of their importance has remained elusive. 
020       In this paper, we show that three factors can account for the referencing pattern of citation networks for two topics, namely "graphenes" and "complex networks", thus allowing one to reproduce the topological features of the networks built with papers being the nodes and the edges established by citations. The most relevant factor was content similarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and {age of publication} had varying importance depending on the topic studied. This dependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by intuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or institutions to affect the referencing pattern, and this is only indirectly considered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation. Because information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its effect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with distinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have twice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for a paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger fitness evolved with time with slightly higher values than for the control network (no fitness considered), a drastic effect was noted for the community with smaller fitness.

010       Identification of Literary Movements Using Complex Networks to Represent   Texts
021       The use of statistical methods to analyze large databases of text has been useful to unveil patterns of human behavior and establish historical links between cultures and languages. 
020       In this study, we identify literary movements by treating books published from 1590 to 1922 as complex networks, whose metrics were analyzed with multivariate techniques to generate six clusters of books. The latter correspond to time periods coinciding with relevant literary movements over the last 5 centuries. The most important factor contributing to the distinction between different literary styles was {the average shortest path length (particularly, the asymmetry of the distribution)}. Furthermore, over time there has been a trend toward larger average shortest path lengths, which is correlated with increased syntactic complexity, and a more uniform use of the words reflected in a smaller power-law coefficient for the distribution of word frequency. Changes in literary style were also found to be driven by opposition to earlier writing styles, as revealed by the analysis performed with geometrical concepts. The approaches adopted here are generic and may be extended to analyze a number of features of languages and cultures.

010       Using Complex Networks to Quantify Consistency in the Use of Words
021       In this paper we quantify the consistency of word usage in written texts represented by complex networks, where words were taken as nodes, by measuring the degree of preservation of the node neighborhood.} Words were considered highly consistent if the authors used them with the same neighborhood. 
020       When ranked according to the consistency of use, the words obeyed a log-normal distribution, in contrast to the Zipf's law that applies to the frequency of use. Consistency correlated positively with the familiarity and frequency of use, and negatively with ambiguity and age of acquisition. An inspection of some highly consistent words confirmed that they are used in very limited semantic contexts. A comparison of consistency indices for 8 authors indicated that these indices may be employed for author recognition. Indeed, as expected authors of novels could be distinguished from those who wrote scientific texts. Our analysis demonstrated the suitability of the consistency indices, which can now be applied in other tasks, such as emotion recognition.

010       Graph and Network Theory in Physics
021       A book Chapter consisting of some of the main areas of research in graph theory applied to physics. 
020       It includes graphs in condensed matter theory, such as the tight-binding and the Hubbard model. It follows the study of graph theory and statistical physics by means of the analysis of the Potts model. Then, we consider the use of graph polynomials in solving Feynman integrals, graphs and electrical networks, vibrational analysis in networked systems and random graphs. The second part deals with the study of complex networks and includes the models of "small-world", "scale-freeness", network motifs, centrality measures, the use of statistical mechanics for the analysis of networks and network communicability and the study of communities in networks. The chapter is finished by considering some dynamical models on networks, such as the consensus analysis, synchronization of coupled oscillators and epidemic models on networks.

010       Unveiling the relationship between complex networks metrics and word   senses
021       The automatic disambiguation of word senses (i.e., the identification of which of the meanings is used in a given context for a word that has multiple meanings) is essential for such applications as machine translation and information retrieval, and represents a key step for developing the so-called Semantic Web. 
020       Humans disambiguate words in a straightforward fashion, but this does not apply to computers. In this paper we address the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) by treating texts as complex networks, and show that word senses can be distinguished upon characterizing the local structure around ambiguous words. Our goal was not to obtain the best possible disambiguation system, but we nevertheless found that in half of the cases our approach outperforms traditional shallow methods. We show that the hierarchical connectivity and clustering of words are usually the most relevant features for WSD. The results reported here shine light on the relationship between semantic and structural parameters of complex networks. They also indicate that when combined with traditional techniques the complex network approach may be useful to enhance the discrimination of senses in large texts

010       Word sense disambiguation via high order of learning in complex networks
021       Complex networks have been employed to model many real systems and as a modeling tool in a myriad of applications. 
020       In this paper, we use the framework of complex networks to the problem of supervised classification in the word disambiguation task, which consists in deriving a function from the supervised (or labeled) training data of ambiguous words. Traditional supervised data classification takes into account only topological or physical features of the input data. On the other hand, the human (animal) brain performs both low- and high-level orders of learning and it has facility to identify patterns according to the semantic meaning of the input data. In this paper, we apply a hybrid technique which encompasses both types of learning in the field of word sense disambiguation and show that the high-level order of learning can really improve the accuracy rate of the model. This evidence serves to demonstrate that the internal structures formed by the words do present patterns that, generally, cannot be correctly unveiled by only traditional techniques. Finally, we exhibit the behavior of the model for different weights of the low- and high-level classifiers by plotting decision boundaries. This study helps one to better understand the effectiveness of the model.

010       Complex networks analysis of language complexity
021       Methods from statistical physics, such as those involving complex networks, have been increasingly used in quantitative analysis of linguistic phenomena. 
020       In this paper, we represented pieces of text with different levels of simplification in co-occurrence networks and found that topological regularity correlated negatively with textual complexity. Furthermore, in less complex texts the distance between concepts, represented as nodes, tended to decrease. The complex networks metrics were treated with multivariate pattern recognition techniques, which allowed us to distinguish between original texts and their simplified versions. For each original text, two simplified versions were generated manually with increasing number of simplification operations. As expected, distinction was easier for the strongly simplified versions, where the most relevant metrics were node strength, shortest paths and diversity. Also, the discrimination of complex texts was improved with higher hierarchical network metrics, thus pointing to the usefulness of considering wider contexts around the concepts. Though the accuracy rate in the distinction was not as high as in methods using deep linguistic knowledge, the complex network approach is still useful for a rapid screening of texts whenever assessing complexity is essential to guarantee accessibility to readers with limited reading ability

010       Spreading dynamics on spatially constrained complex brain networks
021       The study of dynamical systems defined on complex networks provides a natural framework with which to investigate myriad features of neural dynamics, and has been widely undertaken. 
020       Typically, however, networks employed in theoretical studies bear little relation to the spatial embedding or connectivity of the neural networks that they attempt to replicate. Here, we employ detailed neuroimaging data to define a network whose spatial embedding represents accurately the folded structure of the cortical surface of a rat and investigate the propagation of activity over this network under simple spreading and connectivity rules. By comparison with standard network models with the same coarse statistics, we show that the cortical geometry influences profoundly the speed propagation of activation through the network. Our conclusions are of high relevance to the theoretical modelling of epileptic seizure events, and indicate that such studies which omit physiological network structure risk simplifying the dynamics in a potentially significant way.

010       Analyzing complex functional brain networks: fusing statistics and   network science to understand the brain
021       Complex functional brain network analyses have exploded over the last eight years, gaining traction due to their profound clinical implications. 
020       The application of network science (an interdisciplinary offshoot of graph theory) has facilitated these analyses and enabled examining the brain as an integrated system that produces complex behaviors. While the field of statistics has been integral in advancing activation analyses and some connectivity analyses in functional neuroimaging research, it has yet to play a commensurate role in complex network analyses. Fusing novel statistical methods with network-based functional neuroimage analysis will engender powerful analytical tools that will aid in our understanding of normal brain function as well as alterations due to various brain disorders. Here we survey widely used statistical and network science tools for analyzing fMRI network data and discuss the challenges faced in filling some of the remaining methodological gaps. When applied and interpreted correctly, the fusion of network scientific and statistical methods has a chance to revolutionize the understanding of brain function.

010       Constant Communities in Complex Networks
021       Identifying community structure is a fundamental problem in network analysis. 
020       Most community detection algorithms are based on optimizing a combinatorial parameter, for example modularity. This optimization is generally NP-hard, thus merely changing the vertex order can alter their assignments to the community. However, there has been very less study on how vertex ordering influences the results of the community detection algorithms. Here we identify and study the properties of invariant groups of vertices (constant communities) whose assignment to communities are, quite remarkably, not affected by vertex ordering. The percentage of constant communities can vary across different applications and based on empirical results we propose metrics to evaluate these communities. Using constant communities as a pre-processing step, one can significantly reduce the variation of the results. Finally, we present a case study on phoneme network and illustrate that constant communities, quite strikingly, form the core functional units of the larger communities.

010       The nonlinear heat equation on dense graphs and graph limits
021       We use the combination of ideas and results from the theory of graph limits and nonlinear evolution equations to provide a rigorous mathematical justification for taking continuum limit for certain nonlocally coupled networks and to extend this method to cover many complex networks, for which it has not been applied before. 
020       Specifically, for dynamical networks on convergent sequences of simple and weighted graphs, we prove convergence of solutions of the initial-value problems for discrete models to those of the limiting continuous equations. In addition, for sequences of simple graphs converging to {0, 1}-valued graphons, it is shown that the convergence rate depends on the fractal dimension of the boundary of the support of the graph limit. These results are then used to study the regions of continuity of chimera states and the attractors of the nonlocal Kuramoto equation on certain multipartite graphs. Furthermore, the analytical tools developed in this work are used in the rigorous justification of the continuum limit for networks on random graphs that we undertake in a companion paper (Medvedev, 2013). <br />As a by-product of the analysis of the continuum limit on deterministic and random graphs, we identify the link between this problem and the convergence analysis of several classical numerical schemes: the collocation, Galerkin, and Monte-Carlo methods. Therefore, our results can be used to characterize convergence of these approximate methods of solving initial-value problems for nonlinear evolution equations with nonlocal interactions.

010       Tradition and Innovation in Scientists&#x27; Research Strategies
021       What factors affect a scientist's choice of research problem? Qualitative research in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science suggests that this choice is shaped by an "essential tension" between the professional demand for productivity and a conflicting drive toward risky innovation. 
020       We examine this tension empirically in the context of biomedical chemistry. We use complex networks to represent the evolving state of scientific knowledge, as expressed in publications. We then define research strategies relative to these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals or chemical relationships--or delve deeper into known ones. They can consolidate existing knowledge clusters, or bridge distant ones. Analyzing such choices in aggregate, we find that the distribution of strategies remains remarkably stable, even as chemical knowledge grows dramatically. High-risk strategies, which explore new chemical relationships, are less prevalent in the literature, reflecting a growing focus on established knowledge at the expense of new opportunities. Research following a risky strategy is more likely to be ignored but also more likely to achieve high impact and recognition. While the outcome of a risky strategy has a higher expected reward than the outcome of a conservative strategy, the additional reward is insufficient to compensate for the additional risk. By studying the winners of 137 different prizes in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that the occasional "gamble" for extraordinary impact is the most plausible explanation for observed levels of risk-taking. Our empirical demonstration and unpacking of the "essential tension" suggests policy interventions that may foster more innovative research.

020       In this paper we review some recent approaches to air transport, which make extensive use of theory of complex networks. We discuss possible networks that can be defined for the air transport and we focus our attention to networks of airports connected by flights. We review several papers investigating the topology of these networks and their dynamics for time scales ranging from years to intraday intervals, and consider also the resilience properties of air networks to extreme events. Finally we discuss the results of some recent papers investigating the dynamics on air transport network, with emphasis on passengers traveling in the network and epidemic spreading mediated by air transport.

010       Network-based stochastic competitive learning approach to disambiguation   in collaborative networks
021       Many patterns have been uncovered in complex systems through the application of concepts and methodologies of complex networks. 
020       Unfortunately, the validity and accuracy of the unveiled patterns are strongly dependent on the amount of unavoidable noise pervading the data, such as the presence of homonymous individuals in social networks. In the current paper, we investigate the problem of name disambiguation in collaborative networks, a task that plays a fundamental role on a myriad of scientific contexts. In special, we use an unsupervised technique which relies on a particle competition mechanism in a networked environment to detect the clusters. It has been shown that, in this kind of environment, the learning process can be improved because the network representation of data can capture topological features of the input data set. Specifically, in the proposed disambiguating model, a set of particles is randomly spawned into the nodes constituting the network. As time progresses, the particles employ a movement strategy composed of a probabilistic convex mixture of random and preferential walking policies. In the former, the walking rule exclusively depends on the topology of the network and is responsible for the exploratory behavior of the particles. In the latter, the walking rule depends both on the topology and the domination levels that the particles impose on the neighboring nodes. This type of behavior compels the particles to perform a defensive strategy, because it will force them to revisit nodes that are already dominated by them, rather than exploring rival territories. Computer simulations conducted on the networks extracted from the arXiv repository of preprint papers and also from other databases reveal the effectiveness of the model, which turned out to be more accurate than traditional clustering methods.

010       Probing the statistical properties of unknown texts: application to the   Voynich Manuscript
021       While the use of statistical physics methods to analyze large corpora has been useful to unveil many patterns in texts, no comprehensive investigation has been performed investigating the properties of statistical measurements across different languages and texts. 
020       In this study we propose a framework that aims at determining if a text is compatible with a natural language and which languages are closest to it, without any knowledge of the meaning of the words. The approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained from first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of complex networks representing text, and from intermittency concepts where text is treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the New Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and Portuguese in order to quantify the dependency of the different measurements on the language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be informative in distinguishing real texts from their shuffled versions include assortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze an undeciphered medieval manuscript known as the Voynich Manuscript. We show that it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with random texts. We also obtain candidates for key-words of the Voynich Manuscript which could be helpful in the effort of deciphering it. Because we were able to identify statistical measurements that are more dependent on the syntax than on the semantics, the framework may also serve for text analysis in language-dependent applications.

010       Structure-semantics interplay in complex networks and its effects on the   predictability of similarity in texts
021       There are different ways to define similarity for grouping similar texts into clusters, as the concept of similarity may depend on the purpose of the task. 
020       For instance, in topic extraction similar texts mean those within the same semantic field, whereas in author recognition stylistic features should be considered. In this study, we introduce ways to classify texts employing concepts of complex networks, which may be able to capture syntactic, semantic and even pragmatic features. The interplay between the various metrics of the complex networks is analyzed with three applications, namely identification of machine translation (MT) systems, evaluation of quality of machine translated texts and authorship recognition. We shall show that topological features of the networks representing texts can enhance the ability to identify MT systems in particular cases. For evaluating the quality of MT texts, on the other hand, high correlation was obtained with methods capable of capturing the semantics. This was expected because the golden standards used are themselves based on word co-occurrence. Notwithstanding, the Katz similarity, which involves semantic and structure in the comparison of texts, achieved the highest correlation with the NIST measurement, indicating that in some cases the combination of both approaches can improve the ability to quantify quality in MT. In authorship recognition, again the topological features were relevant in some contexts, though for the books and authors analyzed good results were obtained with semantic features as well. Because hybrid approaches encompassing semantic and topological features have not been extensively used, we believe that the methodology proposed here may be useful to enhance text classification considerably, as it combines well-established strategies.

021       Taking precautions before or during the start of a virus outbreak can heavily reduce the number of infected. 
020       The question which individuals should be immunized in order to mitigate the impact of the virus on the rest of population has received quite some attention in the literature. The dynamics of the of a virus spread through a population is often represented as information spread over a complex network. The strategies commonly proposed to determine which nodes are to be selected for immunization often involve only one centrality measure at a time, while often the topology of the network seems to suggest that a single metric is insufficient to capture the influence of a node entirely. <br />In this work we present a generic method based on a genetic algorithm (GA) which does not rely explicitly on any centrality measures during its search but only exploits this type of information to narrow the search space. The fitness of an individual is defined as the estimated expected number of infections of a virus following SIR dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on two contact networks: the Goodreau's Faux Mesa high school and the US air transportation network. The GA method manages to outperform the most common strategies based on a single metric for the air transportation network and its performance is comparable with the best performing strategy for the high school network.

010       Coevolution and correlated multiplexity in multiplex networks
021       Distinct channels of interaction in a complex networked system define network layers, which co-exist and co-operate for the system's function. 
020       Towards realistic modeling and understanding such multiplex systems, we introduce and study a class of growing multiplex network models in which different network layers coevolve, and examine how the entangled growth of coevolving layers can shape the overall network structure. We show analytically and numerically that the coevolution can induce strong degree correlations across layers, as well as modulate degree distributions. We further show that such a coevolution-induced correlated multiplexity can alter the system's response to dynamical process, exemplified by the suppressed susceptibility to a threshold cascade process.

010       Mixing local and global information for community detection in large   networks
021       The problem of clustering large complex networks plays a key role in several scientific fields ranging from Biology to Sociology and Computer Science. 
020       Many approaches to clustering complex networks are based on the idea of maximizing a network modularity function. Some of these approaches can be classified as global because they exploit knowledge about the whole network topology to find clusters. Other approaches, instead, can be interpreted as local because they require only a partial knowledge of the network topology, e.g., the neighbors of a vertex. Global approaches are able to achieve high values of modularity but they do not scale well on large networks and, therefore, they cannot be applied to analyze on-line social networks like Facebook or YouTube. In contrast, local approaches are fast and scale up to large, real-life networks, at the cost of poorer results than those achieved by local methods. In this article we propose a glocal method to maximizing modularity, i.e., our method uses information at the global level, yet its scalability on large networks is comparable to that of local methods. The proposed method is called COmplex Network CLUster DEtection (or, shortly, CONCLUDE.) It works in two stages: in the first stage it uses an information-propagation model, based on random and non-backtracking walks of finite length, to compute the importance of each edge in keeping the network connected (called edge centrality.) Then, edge centrality is used to map network vertices onto points of an Euclidean space and to compute distances between all pairs of connected vertices. In the second stage, CONCLUDE uses the distances computed in the first stage to partition the network into clusters. CONCLUDE is computationally efficient since in the average case its cost is roughly linear in the number of edges of the network.

010       ABACUS: frequent pAttern mining-BAsed Community discovery in   mUltidimensional networkS
021       Community Discovery in complex networks is the problem of detecting, for each node of the network, its membership to one of more groups of nodes, the communities, that are densely connected, or highly interactive, or, more in general, similar, according to a similarity function. 
020       So far, the problem has been widely studied in monodimensional networks, i.e. networks where only one connection between two entities can exist. However, real networks are often multidimensional, i.e., multiple connections between any two nodes can exist, either reflecting different kinds of relationships, or representing different values of the same type of tie. In this context, the problem of Community Discovery has to be redefined, taking into account multidimensional structure of the graph. We define a new concept of community that groups together nodes sharing memberships to the same monodimensional communities in the different single dimensions. As we show, such communities are meaningful and able to group highly correlated nodes, even if they might not be connected in any of the monodimensional networks. We devise ABACUS (Apriori-BAsed Community discoverer in mUltidimensional networkS), an algorithm that is able to extract multidimensional communities based on the apriori itemset miner applied to monodimensional community memberships. Experiments on two different real multidimensional networks confirm the meaningfulness of the introduced concepts, and open the way for a new class of algorithms for community discovery that do not rely on the dense connections among nodes.

010       Weakly Explosive Percolation in Directed Networks
021       Percolation, the formation of a macroscopic connected component, is a key feature in the description of complex networks. 
020       The dynamical properties of a variety of systems can be understood in terms of percolation, including the robustness of power grids and information networks, the spreading of epidemics and forest fires, and the stability of gene regulatory networks. Recent studies have shown that if network edges are added "competitively" in undirected networks, the onset of percolation is abrupt or "explosive." The unusual qualitative features of this phase transition have been the subject of much recent attention. Here we generalize this previously studied network growth process from undirected networks to directed networks and use finite-size scaling theory to find several scaling exponents. We find that this process is also characterized by a very rapid growth in the giant component, but that this growth is not as sudden as in undirected networks.

010       On the Origins of Hierarchy in Complex Networks
021       Hierarchy seems to pervade complexity in both living and artificial systems. 
020       Despite its relevance, no general theory that captures all features of hierarchy and its origins has been proposed yet. Here we present a formal approach resulting from the convergence of theoretical morphology and network theory that allows constructing a 3D morphospace of hierarchies and hence comparing the hierarchical organization of ecological, cellular, technological and social networks. Embedded within large voids in the morphospace of all possible hierarchies, four major groups are identified. Two of them match the expected from random networks with similar connectivity, thus suggesting that non-adaptive factors are at work. Ecological and gene networks define the other two, indicating that their topological order is the result of functional constraints. These results are consistent with an exploration of the morphospace using in silico evolved networks.

010       Cluster Explosive Synchronization in Complex Networks
021       The emergence of explosive synchronization has been reported as an abrupt transition in complex networks of first-order Kuramoto oscillators. 
020       In this Letter, we demonstrate that the nodes in a second-order Kuramoto model, perform a cascade of transitions toward a synchronous macroscopic state, which is a novel phenomenon that we call \textit{cluster explosive synchronization}. We provide a rigorous analytical treatment using a mean-field analysis in uncorrelated networks. Our findings are in good agreement with numerical simulations and fundamentally deepen the understanding of microscopic mechanisms toward synchronization.

010       The Evolutionary Vaccination Dilemma in Complex Networks
021       In this work we analyze the evolution of voluntary vaccination in networked populations by entangling the spreading dynamics of an influenza-like disease with an evolutionary framework taking place at the end of each influenza season so that individuals take or not the vaccine upon their previous experience. 
020       Our framework thus put in competition two well-known dynamical properties of scale-free networks: the fast propagation of diseases and the promotion of cooperative behaviors. Our results show that when vaccine is perfect scale-free networks enhance the vaccination behavior with respect to random graphs with homogeneous connectivity patterns. However, when imperfection appears we find a cross-over effect so that the number of infected (vaccinated) individuals increases (decreases) with respect to homogeneous networks, thus showing up the competition between the aforementioned properties of scale-free graphs.

010       How does degree heterogeneity affect nucleation of Ising model on   complex networks?
021       We investigate the nucleation of Ising model on complex networks and focus on the role played by the heterogeneity of degree distribution on nucleation rate. 
020       Using Monte Carlo simulation combined with forward flux sampling, we find that for a weak external field the nucleation rate decreases monotonically as degree heterogeneity increases. Interestingly, for a relatively strong external field the nucleation rate exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on degree heterogeneity, in which there exists a maximal nucleation rate at an intermediate level of degree heterogeneity. Furthermore, we develop a heterogeneous mean-field theory for evaluating the free-energy barrier of nucleation. The theoretical estimations are qualitatively consistent with the simulation results. Our study suggests that degree heterogeneity plays a nontrivial role in the dynamics of phase transition in networked Ising systems.

010       Spatial extent of an outbreak in animal epidemics
021       Characterizing the spatial extent of epidemics at the outbreak stage is key to controlling the evolution of the disease. 
020       At the outbreak, the number of infected individuals is typically small, so that fluctuations around their average are important: then, it is commonly assumed that the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) mechanism can be described by a stochastic birth-death process of Galton-Watson type. The displacements of the infected individuals can be modelled by resorting to Brownian motion, which is applicable when long-range movements and complex network interactions can be safely neglected, as in case of animal epidemics. In this context, the spatial extent of an epidemic can be assessed by computing the convex hull enclosing the infected individuals at a given time. We derive the exact evolution equations for the mean perimeter and the mean area of the convex hull, and compare them with Monte Carlo simulations.

010       Quantum Google in a Complex Network
021       We investigate the behavior of the recently proposed quantum Google algorithm, or quantum PageRank, in large complex networks. 
020       Applying the quantum algorithm to a part of the real World Wide Web, we find that the algorithm is able to univocally reveal the underlying scale-free topology of the network and to clearly identify and order the most relevant nodes (hubs) of the graph according to their importance in the network structure. Moreover, our results show that the quantum PageRank algorithm generically leads to changes in the hierarchy of nodes. In addition, as compared to its classical counterpart, the quantum algorithm is capable to clearly highlight the structure of secondary hubs of the network, and to partially resolve the degeneracy in importance of the low lying part of the list of rankings, which represents a typical shortcoming of the classical PageRank algorithm. Complementary to this study, our analysis shows that the algorithm is able to clearly distinguish scale-free networks from other widespread and important classes of complex networks, such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks and hierarchical graphs. We show that the ranking capabilities of the quantum PageRank algorithm are related to an increased stability with respect to a variation of the damping parameter $\alpha$ that appears in the Google algorithm, and to a more clearly pronounced power-law behavior in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the classical algorithm. Finally, we study to which extent the increased sensitivity of the quantum algorithm persists under coordinated attacks of the most important nodes in scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs.

010       Analysis of Remote Synchronization in Complex Networks
021       A novel regime of synchronization, called remote synchronization, where the peripheral nodes form a phase synchronized cluster not including the hub, was recently observed in star motifs. 
020       We show the existence of a more general dynamical state of remote synchronization in arbitrary networks of coupled oscillators. This state is characterized by the synchronization of pairs of nodes that are not directly connected via a physical link or any sequence of synchronized nodes. This phenomenon is almost negligible in networks of phase oscillators as its underlying mechanism is the modulation of the amplitude of those intermediary nodes between the remotely synchronized units. Our findings thus show the ubiquity and robustness of these states and bridge the gap from their recent observation in simple toy graphs to complex networks.

010       Discovering link communities in complex networks by exploiting link   dynamics
021       Discovery of communities in complex networks is a fundamental data analysis problem with applications in various domains. 
020       Most of the existing approaches have focused on discovering communities of nodes, while recent studies have shown great advantages and utilities of the knowledge of communities of links in networks. From this new perspective, we propose a link dynamics based algorithm, called UELC, for identifying link communities of networks. In UELC, the stochastic process of a link-node-link random walk is employed to unfold an embedded bipartition structure of links in a network. The local mixing properties of the Markov chain underlying the random walk are then utilized to extract two emerged link communities. Further, the random walk and the bipartitioning processes are wrapped in an iterative subdivision strategy to recursively identify link partitions that segregate the network links into multiple subdivisions. We evaluate the performance of the new method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its utility on real-world networks. Our experimental results show that our method is highly effective for discovering link communities in complex networks. As a comparison, we also extend UELC to extracting communities of node, and show that it is effective for node community identification.

010       Combinatorial Analysis of Multiple Networks
021       The study of complex networks has been historically based on simple graph data models representing relationships between individuals. 
020       However, often reality cannot be accurately captured by a flat graph model. This has led to the development of multi-layer networks. These models have the potential of becoming the reference tools in network data analysis, but require the parallel development of specific analysis methods explicitly exploiting the information hidden in-between the layers and the availability of a critical mass of reference data to experiment with the tools and investigate the real-world organization of these complex systems. In this work we introduce a real-world layered network combining different kinds of online and offline relationships, and present an innovative methodology and related analysis tools suggesting the existence of hidden motifs traversing and correlating different representation layers. We also introduce a notion of betweenness centrality for multiple networks. While some preliminary experimental evidence is reported, our hypotheses are still largely unverified, and in our opinion this calls for the availability of new analysis methods but also new reference multi-layer social network data.

010       Generalized Measures for the Evaluation of Community Detection Methods
021       Community detection can be considered as a variant of cluster analysis applied to complex networks. 
020       For this reason, all existing studies have been using tools derived from this field when evaluating community detection algorithms. However, those are not completely relevant in the context of network analysis, because they ignore an essential part of the available information: the network structure. Therefore, they can lead to incorrect interpretations. In this article, we review these measures, and illustrate this limitation. We propose a modification to solve this problem, and apply it to the three most widespread measures: purity, Rand index and normalized mutual information (NMI). We then perform an experimental evaluation on artificially generated networks with realistic community structure. We assess the relevance of the modified measures by comparison with their traditional counterparts, and also relatively to the topological properties of the community structures. On these data, the modified NMI turns out to provide the most relevant results.

010       Genetic Algorithm with Ensemble Learning for Detecting Community   Structure in Complex Networks
021       Community detection in complex networks is a topic of considerable recent interest within the scientific community. 
020       For dealing with the problem that genetic algorithm are hardly applied to community detection, we propose a genetic algorithm with ensemble learning (GAEL) for detecting community structure in complex networks. GAEL replaces its traditional crossover operator with a multi-individual crossover operator based on ensemble learning. Therefore, GAEL can avoid the problems that are brought by traditional crossover operator which is only able to mix string blocks of different individuals, but not able to recombine clustering contexts of different individuals into new better ones. In addition, the local search strategy, which makes mutated node be placed into the community where most of its neighbors are, is used in mutation operator. At last, a Markov random walk based method is used to initialize population in this paper, and it can provide us a population of accurate and diverse clustering solutions. Those diverse and accurate individuals are suitable for ensemble learning based multi-individual crossover operator. The proposed GAEL is tested on both computer-generated and real-world networks, and compared with current representative algorithms for community detection in complex networks. Experimental results demonstrate that GAEL is highly effective at discovering community structure.

010       Markov random walk under constraint for discovering overlapping   communities in complex networks
021       Detection of overlapping communities in complex networks has motivated recent research in the relevant fields. 
020       Aiming this problem, we propose a Markov dynamics based algorithm, called UEOC, which means, 'unfold and extract overlapping communities'. In UEOC, when identifying each natural community that overlaps, a Markov random walk method combined with a constraint strategy, which is based on the corresponding annealed network (degree conserving random network), is performed to unfold the community. Then, a cutoff criterion with the aid of a local community function, called conductance, which can be thought of as the ratio between the number of edges inside the community and those leaving it, is presented to extract this emerged community from the entire network. The UEOC algorithm depends on only one parameter whose value can be easily set, and it requires no prior knowledge on the hidden community structures. The proposed UEOC has been evaluated both on synthetic benchmarks and on some real-world networks, and was compared with a set of competing algorithms. Experimental result has shown that UEOC is highly effective and efficient for discovering overlapping communities.

010       Overlapping Community Detection in Complex Networks using Symmetric   Binary Matrix Factorization
021       Discovering overlapping community structures is a crucial step to understanding the structure and dynamics of many networks. 
020       In this paper we develop a symmetric binary matrix factorization model (SBMF) to identify overlapping communities. Our model allows us not only to assign community memberships explicitly to nodes, but also to distinguish outliers from overlapping nodes. In addition, we propose a modified partition density to evaluate the quality of community structures. We use this to determine the most appropriate number of communities. We evaluate our methods using both synthetic benchmarks and real world networks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

010       Model of complex networks based on citation dynamics
021       Complex networks of real-world systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena, producing structures far from regular or random. 
020       These include scale-free degree distributions, small-world structure and assortative mixing by degree, which are also the properties captured by different random graph models proposed in the literature. However, many (non-social) real-world networks are in fact disassortative by degree. Thus, we here propose a simple evolving model that generates networks with most common properties of real-world networks including degree disassortativity. Furthermore, the model has a natural interpretation for citation networks with different practical applications.

010       Genetic Algorithm with a Local Search Strategy for Discovering   Communities in Complex Networks
021       In order to further improve the performance of current genetic algorithms aiming at discovering communities, a local search based genetic algorithm GALS is here proposed. 
020       The core of GALS is a local search based mutation technique. In order to overcome the drawbacks of traditional mutation methods, the paper develops the concept of marginal gene and then the local monotonicity of modularity function Q is deduced from each nodes local view. Based on these two elements, a new mutation method combined with a local search strategy is presented. GALS has been evaluated on both synthetic benchmarks and several real networks, and compared with some presently competing algorithms. Experimental results show that GALS is highly effective and efficient for discovering community structure.

010       Ant Colony Optimization with a New Random Walk Model for Community   Detection in Complex Networks
021       Detecting communities from complex networks has recently triggered great interest. 
020       Aiming at this problem, a new ant colony optimization strategy building on the Markov random walks theory, which is named as MACO, is proposed in this paper. The framework of ant colony optimization is taken as the basic framework in this algorithm. In each iteration, a Markov random walk model is employed as heuristic rule; all of the ants local solutions are aggregated to a global one through an idea of clustering ensemble, which then will be used to update a pheromone matrix. The strategy relies on the progressive strengthening of within-community links and the weakening of between-community links. Gradually this converges to a solution where the underlying community structure of the complex network will become clearly visible. The proposed MACO has been evaluated both on synthetic benchmarks and on some real-world networks, and compared with some present competing algorithms. Experimental result has shown that MACO is highly effective for discovering communities.

010       Fast Complex Network Clustering Algorithm Using Agents
021       Recently, the sizes of networks are always very huge, and they take on distributed nature. 
020       Aiming at this kind of network clustering problem, in the sight of local view, this paper proposes a fast network clustering algorithm in which each node is regarded as an agent, and each agent tries to maximize its local function in order to optimize network modularity defined by function Q, rather than optimize function Q from the global view as traditional methods. Both the efficiency and effectiveness of this algorithm are tested against computer-generated and real-world networks. Experimental result shows that this algorithm not only has the ability of clustering large-scale networks, but also can attain very good clustering quality compared with the existing algorithms. Furthermore, the parameters of this algorithm are analyzed.

010       Effect of Unfolding on the Spectral Statistics of Adjacency Matrices of   Complex Networks
021       Random matrix theory is finding an increasing number of applications in the context of information theory and communication systems, especially in studying the properties of complex networks. 
020       Such properties include short-term and long-term correlation. We study the spectral fluctuations of the adjacency of networks using random-matrix theory. We consider the influence of the spectral unfolding, which is a necessary procedure to remove the secular properties of the spectrum, on different spectral statistics. We find that, while the spacing distribution of the eigenvalues shows little sensitivity to the unfolding method used, the spectral rigidity has greater sensitivity to unfolding.

010       Structure of complex networks: Quantifying edge-to-edge relations by   failure-induced flow redistribution
021       The analysis of complex networks has so far revolved mainly around the role of nodes and communities of nodes. 
020       However, the dynamics of interconnected systems is commonly focalised on edge processes, and a dual edge-centric perspective can often prove more natural. Here we present graph-theoretical measures to quantify edge-to-edge relations inspired by the notion of flow redistribution induced by edge failures. Our measures, which are related to the pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian of the network, are global and reveal the dynamical interplay between the edges of a network, including potentially non-local interactions. Our framework also allows us to define the embeddedness of an edge, a measure of how strongly an edge features in the weighted cuts of the network. We showcase the general applicability of our edge-centric framework through analyses of the Iberian Power grid, traffic flow in road networks, and the C. elegans neuronal network.

010       Phase Transitions in the Quadratic Contact Process on Complex Networks
021       The quadratic contact process (QCP) is a natural extension of the well studied linear contact process where infected (1) individuals infect susceptible (0) neighbors at rate $\lambda$ and infected individuals recover ($1 \longrightarrow 0$) at rate 1. 
020       In the QCP, a combination of two 1's is required to effect a $0 \longrightarrow 1$ change. We extend the study of the QCP, which so far has been limited to lattices, to complex networks. \comment{as a model for the change in a population through sexual reproduction and death.} We define two versions of the QCP -- vertex centered (VQCP) and edge centered (EQCP) with birth events $1-0-1 \longrightarrow 1-1-1$ and $1-1-0 \longrightarrow 1-1-1$ respectively, where `$-$' represents an edge. We investigate the effects of network topology by considering the QCP on random regular, Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi and power law random graphs. We perform mean field calculations as well as simulations to find the steady state fraction of occupied vertices as a function of the birth rate. We find that on the random regular and Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graphs, there is a discontinuous phase transition with a region of bistability, whereas on the heavy tailed power law graph, the transition is continuous. The critical birth rate is found to be positive in the former but zero in the latter.

010       Detecting Overlapping Temporal Community Structure in Time-Evolving   Networks
021       We present a principled approach for detecting overlapping temporal community structure in dynamic networks. 
020       Our method is based on the following framework: find the overlapping temporal community structure that maximizes a quality function associated with each snapshot of the network subject to a temporal smoothness constraint. A novel quality function and a smoothness constraint are proposed to handle overlaps, and a new convex relaxation is used to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We provide theoretical guarantees as well as experimental results that reveal community structure in real and synthetic networks. Our main insight is that certain structures can be identified only when temporal correlation is considered and when communities are allowed to overlap. In general, discovering such overlapping temporal community structure can enhance our understanding of real-world complex networks by revealing the underlying stability behind their seemingly chaotic evolution.

020       We find that such complex networks exhibit qualitatively similar behavior when fed with external nutrient flux. The nutrient is preferentially transformed into one specific chemical that is an intrinsic property of the network. We propose a self-consistent proto-cell toy model in which the preferentially synthesized chemical is a precursor for the cell membrane, and show that such proto-cells can exhibit sustainable homeostatic growth when fed with any nutrient diffusing through the membrane, provided that nutrient is metabolized at a sufficient rate.

010       Statistical inference framework for source detection of contagion   processes on arbitrary network structures
021       In this paper we introduce a statistical inference framework for estimating the contagion source from a partially observed contagion spreading process on an arbitrary network structure. 
020       The framework is based on a maximum likelihood estimation of a partial epidemic realization and involves large scale simulation of contagion spreading processes from the set of potential source locations. We present a number of different likelihood estimators that are used to determine the conditional probabilities associated to observing partial epidemic realization with particular source location candidates. This statistical inference framework is also applicable for arbitrary compartment contagion spreading processes on networks. We compare estimation accuracy of these approaches in a number of computational experiments performed with the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered), SI (susceptible-infected) and ISS (ignorant-spreading-stifler) contagion spreading models on synthetic and real-world complex networks.

010       The Crab Nebula and the class of Type IIn-P supernovae caused by   sub-energetic electron capture explosions
021       What sort of supernova gave rise to the Crab Nebula? There are several indications that the Crab arose from a sub-energetic explosion of an 8-10 Msun star, this appears to conflict with the high luminosity indicated by historical observations. 
020       This paper shows that several properties of the Crab are best suited to Type IIn-P explosions (Type IIn spectra with plateau light curves). These events probably arise from relatively low-energy (1e50 erg) explosions with low 56Ni yield resulting from electron-capture SNe (ecSNe), but their high luminosity and Type IIn spectra are dominated by shock interaction with CSM. After about 120 days, nearly all of the mass in the CSM and ejecta ends up in a slow dense shell. In the scenario proposed here for SN1054, this thin shell is accelerated by the growing pulsar wind nebula, producing the complex network of filaments seen today. There is no need to invoke the invisible fast SN envelope hypothesized to reside outside the Crab. SNeIIn-P explain several observed features of the Crab: (1) No blast wave or rapidly expanding SN envelope outside the filaments, (2) a total mass of 5 Msun swept up in a thin shell, (3) a high peak luminosity despite the low kinetic energy, and (4) chemical abundances consistent with an 8-10 Msun star and low 56Ni yield. A number of other implications are discussed, concerning other Crab-like remnants, dust in the Crab filaments, diversity in the initial masses of SNe IIn, and an association between ecSNe and SN impostors. This model predicts that if light echoes from SN1054 are discovered, they will be consistent with a Type IIn-P spectrum.

010       Bose-Einstein Condensation in Satisfiability Problems
021       This paper is concerned with the complex behavior arising in satisfiability problems. 
020       We present a new statistical physics-based characterization of the satisfiability problem. Specifically, we design an algorithm that is able to produce graphs starting from a k-SAT instance, in order to analyze them and show whether a Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. We observe that, analogously to complex networks, the networks of k-SAT instances follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. In particular, k-SAT instances move from a fit-get-rich network to a winner-takes-all network as the ratio of clauses to variables decreases, and the phase transition of k-SAT approximates the critical temperature for the Bose-Einstein condensation. Finally, we employ the fitness-based classification to enhance SAT solvers (e.g., ChainSAT) and obtain the consistently highest performing SAT solver for CNF formulas, and therefore a new class of efficient hardware and software verification tools.

010       Spatial Resources Optimization in Distributed MIMO Networks with Limited   Data Sharing
021       Wireless access through a large distributed network of low-complexity infrastructure nodes empowered with cooperation and coordination capabilities, is an emerging radio architecture, candidate to deal with the mobile data capacity crunch. 
020       In the 3GPP evolutionary path, this is known as the Cloud-RAN paradigm for future radio. In such a complex network, distributed MIMO resources optimization is of paramount importance, in order to achieve capacity scaling. In this paper, we investigate efficient strategies towards optimizing the pairing of access nodes with users as well as linear precoding designs for providing fair QoS experience across the whole network, when data sharing is limited due to complexity and overhead constraints. We propose a method for obtaining the exact optimal spatial resources allocation solution which can be applied in networks of limited scale, as well as an approximation algorithm with bounded polynomial complexity which can be used in larger networks. The particular algorithm outperforms existing user-oriented clustering techniques and achieves quite high quality-of-service levels with reasonable complexity.

010       Parenclitic networks: a multilayer description of heterogeneous and   static data-sets
021       Describing a complex system is in many ways a problem akin to identifying an object, in that it involves defining boundaries, constituent parts and their relationships by the use of grouping laws. 
020       Here we propose a novel method which extends the use of complex networks theory to a generalized class of non-Gestaltic systems, taking the form of collections of isolated, possibly heterogeneous, scalars, e.g. sets of biomedical tests. The ability of the method to unveil relevant information is illustrated for the case of gene expression in the response to osmotic stress of {\it Arabidopsis thaliana}. The most important genes turn out to be the nodes with highest centrality in appropriately reconstructed networks. The method allows predicting a set of 15 genes whose relationship with such stress was previously unknown in the literature. The validity of such predictions is demonstrated by means of a target experiment, in which the predicted genes are one by one artificially induced, and the growth of the corresponding phenotypes turns out to feature statistically significant differences when compared to that of the wild-type.

010       Exclusion processes on networks as models for cytoskeletal transport
021       We present a study of exclusion processes on networks as models for complex transport phenomena and in particular for active transport of motor proteins along the cytoskeleton. 
020       We argue that active transport processes on networks spontaneously develop density heterogeneities at various scales. These heterogeneities can be regulated through a variety of multi-scale factors, such as the interplay of exclusion interactions, the non-equilibrium nature of the transport process and the network topology. <br />We show how an effective rate approach allows to develop an understanding of the stationary state of transport processes through complex networks from the phase diagram of one single segment. For exclusion processes we rationalize that the stationary state can be classified in three qualitatively different regimes: a homogeneous phase as well as inhomogeneous network and segment phases. <br />In particular, we present here a study of the stationary state on networks of three paradigmatic models from non-equilibrium statistical physics: the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process, the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process and the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with Langmuir kinetics. With these models we can interpolate between equilibrium (due to bi-directional motion along a network or infinite diffusion) and out-of-equilibrium active directed motion along a network. The study of these models sheds further light on the emergence of density heterogeneities in active phenomena.

Such an algebraic growth is also observed in scientific citation data. We also determine the N dependence of statistical quantities associated with the sparse, large-k range of the degree distribution, such as the location of the first hole (where N_k=0), the last doublet (two consecutive occupied degrees), triplet, dimer (N_k=2), trimer, etc.

010       Braess like Paradox in a Small World Network
021       Braess \cite{1} has been studied about a traffic flow on a diamond type network and found that introducing new edges to the networks always does not achieve the efficiency. 
020       Some researchers studied the Braess' paradox in similar type networks by introducing various types of cost functions. But whether such paradox occurs or not is not scarcely studied in complex networks. In this article, I analytically and numerically study whether Braess like paradox occurs or not on Dorogovtsev-Mendes network\cite{2}, which is a sort of small world networks. The cost function needed to go along an edge is postulated to be equally identified with the length between two nodes, independently of an amount of traffic on the edge. It is also assumed the it takes a certain cost $c$ to pass through the center node in Dorogovtsev-Mendes network. If $c$ is small, then bypasses have the function to provide short cuts. As result of numerical and theoretical analyses, while I find that any Braess' like paradox will not occur when the network size becomes infinite, I can show that a paradoxical phenomenon appears at finite size of network.

020       Previous works described the world air transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized paying special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport.

010       Motifs in Triadic Random Graphs based on Steiner Triple Systems
021       Conventionally, pairwise relationships between nodes are considered to be the fundamental building blocks of complex networks. 
020       However, over the last decade the overabundance of certain sub-network patterns, so called motifs, has attracted high attention. It has been hypothesized, these motifs, instead of links, serve as the building blocks of network structures. <br />Although the relation between a network's topology and the general properties of the system, such as its function, its robustness against perturbations, or its efficiency in spreading information is the central theme of network science, there is still a lack of sound generative models needed for testing the functional role of subgraph motifs. Our work aims to overcome this limitation. <br />We employ the framework of exponential random graphs (ERGMs) to define novel models based on triadic substructures. The fact that only a small portion of triads can actually be set independently poses a challenge for the formulation of such models. To overcome this obstacle we use Steiner Triple Systems (STS). These are partitions of sets of nodes into pair-disjoint triads, which thus can be specified independently. Combining the concepts of ERGMs and STS, we suggest novel generative models capable of generating ensembles of networks with non-trivial triadic Z-score profiles. Further, we discover inevitable correlations between the abundance of triad patterns, which occur solely for statistical reasons and need to be taken into account when discussing the functional implications of motif statistics. Moreover, we calculate the degree distributions of our triadic random graphs analytically.

010       Hubiness, length, crossings and their relationships in dependency trees
021       Here tree dependency structures are studied from three different perspectives: their degree variance (hubiness), the mean dependency length and the number of dependency crossings. 
020       Bounds that reveal pairwise dependencies among these three metrics are derived. Hubiness (the variance of degrees) plays a central role: the mean dependency length is bounded below by hubiness while the number of crossings is bounded above by hubiness. Our findings suggest that the online memory cost of a sentence might be determined not just by the ordering of words but also by the hubiness of the underlying structure. The 2nd moment of degree plays a crucial role that is reminiscent of its role in large complex networks.

010       Non-parametric resampling of random walks for spectral network   clustering
021       Parametric resampling schemes have been recently introduced in complex network analysis with the aim of assessing the statistical significance of graph clustering and the robustness of community partitions. 
020       We propose here a method to replicate structural features of complex networks based on the non-parametric resampling of the transition matrix associated with an unbiased random walk on the graph. We test this bootstrapping technique on synthetic and real-world modular networks and we show that the ensemble of replicates obtained through resampling can be used to improve the performance of standard spectral algorithms for community detection.

010       Epidemic fronts in complex networks with metapopulation structure
021       Infection dynamics have been studied extensively on complex networks, yielding insight into the effects of heterogeneity in contact patterns on disease spread. 
020       Somewhat separately, metapopulations have provided a paradigm for modeling systems with spatially extended and "patchy" organization. In this paper we expand on the use of multitype networks for combining these paradigms, such that simple contagion models can include complexity in the agent interactions and multiscale structure. We first present a generalization of the Volz-Miller mean-field approximation for Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics on multitype networks. We then use this technique to study the special case of epidemic fronts propagating on a one-dimensional lattice of interconnected networks - representing a simple chain of coupled population centers - as a necessary first step in understanding how macro-scale disease spread depends on micro-scale topology. Using the formalism of front propagation into unstable states, we derive the effective transport coefficients of the linear spreading: asymptotic speed, characteristic wavelength, and diffusion coefficient for the leading edge of the pulled fronts, and analyze their dependence on the underlying graph structure. We also derive the epidemic threshold for the system and study the front profile for various network configurations. To our knowledge, this is the first such application of front propagation concepts to random network models.

010       Improving Resource Location with Locally Precomputed Partial Random   Walks
021       Random walks can be used to search complex networks for a desired resource. 
020       To reduce search lengths, we propose a mechanism based on building random walks connecting together partial walks (PW) previously computed at each network node. Resources found in each PW are registered. Searches can then jump over PWs where the resource is not located. However, we assume that perfect recording of resources may be costly, and hence, probabilistic structures like Bloom filters are used. Then, unnecessary hops may come from false positives at the Bloom filters. Two variations of this mechanism have been considered, depending on whether we first choose a PW in the current node and then check it for the resource, or we first check all PWs and then choose one. In addition, PWs can be either simple random walks or self-avoiding random walks. Analytical models are provided to predict expected search lengths and other magnitudes of the resulting four mechanisms. Simulation experiments validate these predictions and allow us to compare these techniques with simple random walk searches, finding very large reductions of expected search lengths.

010       Breathing synchronization in interconnected networks
021       Global synchronization in a complex network of oscillators emerges from the interplay between its topology and the dynamics of the pairwise interactions among its numerous components. 
020       When oscillators are spatially separated, however, a time delay appears in the interaction which might obstruct synchronization. Here we study the synchronization properties of interconnected networks of oscillators with a time delay between networks and analyze the dynamics as a function of the couplings and communication lag. We discover a new breathing synchronization regime, where two groups appear in each network synchronized at different frequencies. Each group has a counterpart in the opposite network, one group is in phase and the other in anti-phase with their counterpart. For strong couplings, instead, networks are internally synchronized but a phase shift between them might occur. The implications of our findings on several socio-technical and biological systems are discussed.

010       Context-Independent Centrality Measures Underestimate the Vulnerability   of Power Grids
021       Power grids vulnerability is a key issue in society. 
020       A component failure may trigger cascades of failures across the grid and lead to a large blackout. Complex network approaches have shown a direction to study some of the problems faced by power grids. Within Complex Network Analysis structural vulnerabilities of power grids have been studied mostly using purely topological approaches, which assumes that flow of power is dictated by shortest paths. However, this fails to capture the real flow characteristics of power grids. We have proposed a flow redistribution mechanism that closely mimics the flow in power grids using the PTDF. With this mechanism we enhance existing cascading failure models to study the vulnerability of power grids. <br />We apply the model to the European high-voltage grid to carry out a comparative study for a number of centrality measures. `Centrality' gives an indication of the criticality of network components. Our model offers a way to find those centrality measures that give the best indication of node vulnerability in the context of power grids, by considering not only the network topology but also the power flowing through the network. In addition, we use the model to determine the spare capacity that is needed to make the grid robust to targeted attacks. We also show a brief comparison of the end results with other power grid systems to generalise the result.

010       Self-Organized Sociopolitical Interactions as the Best Way to Achieve   Organized Patterns in Human Social Systems: Going Beyond the Top-Down Control   of Classical Political Regimes
021       The dissertation extrapolates the theory of self-organization in biological organisms to sociopolitical self-organization, in human social systems. 
020       It is stated that the latter is the best way to organize human social systems, given their complex nature and the impossibility of the computational dynamics that classical political regimes must perform in order to, unsuccesfully, try to organize human social systems by means of top-down control. Sociopolitical self-organization is presented as the optimal producer of order in human social systems, and it is claimed that anarchic complex networks are the resulting structures.

010       Phase transition in the economically modeled growth of a cellular   nervous system
021       Spatially-embedded complex networks, such as nervous systems, the Internet and transportation networks, generally have non-trivial topological patterns of connections combined with nearly minimal wiring costs. 
020       However the growth rules shaping these economical trade-offs between cost and topology are not well understood. Here we study the cellular nervous system of the nematode worm C. elegans, together with information on the birth times of neurons and on their spatial locations. We find that the growth of this network undergoes a transition from an accelerated to a constant increase in the number of links (synaptic connections) as a function of the number of nodes (neurons). The time of this phase transition coincides closely with the observed moment of hatching, when development switches metamorphically from oval to larval stages. We use graph analysis and generative modelling to show that the transition between different growth regimes, as well as its coincidence with the moment of hatching, can be explained by a dynamic economical model which incorporates a trade-off between topology and cost that is continuously negotiated and re-negotiated over developmental time. As the body of the animal progressively elongates, the cost of longer distance connections is increasingly penalised. This growth process regenerates many aspects of the adult nervous system's organization, including the neuronal membership of anatomically pre-defined ganglia. We expect that similar economical principles can be found in the development of other biological or man-made spatially-embedded complex systems.

010       Lobby index as a network centrality measure
021       We study the lobby index (l-index for short) as a local node centrality measure for complex networks. 
020       The l-inde is compared with degree (a local measure), betweenness and Eigenvector centralities (two global measures) in the case of biological network (Yeast interaction protein-protein network) and a linguistic network (Moby Thesaurus II). In both networks, the l-index has poor correlation with betweenness but correlates with degree and Eigenvector. Being a local measure, one can take advantage by using the l-index because it carries more information about its neighbors when compared with degree centrality, indeed it requires less time to compute when compared with Eigenvector centrality. Results suggests that l-index produces better results than degree and Eigenvector measures for ranking purposes, becoming suitable as a tool to perform this task.

010       Towards a general theory for coupling functions allowing persistent   synchronization
021       We study synchronisation properties of networks of coupled dynamical systems with interaction akin to diffusion. 
020       We assume that the isolated node dynamics possesses a forward invariant set on which it has a bounded Jacobian, then we characterise a class of coupling functions that allows for uniformly stable synchronisation in connected complex networks --- in the sense that there is an open neighbourhood of the initial conditions that is uniformly attracted towards synchronisation. Moreover, this stable synchronisation persists under perturbations to non-identical node dynamics. We illustrate the theory with numerical examples and conclude with a discussion on embedding these results in a more general framework of spectral dichotomies.

010       Functional-Friction Networks: New Insights on the Laboratory Earthquakes
021       We report some new applications of functional complex networks on acoustic emission waveforms from frictional interfaces. 
020       Our results show that laboratory faults undergo a sequence of generic phases as well as strengthening, weakening or fast-slip and slow-slip leading to healing. Also, using functional networks, we extend the dissipated energy due to acoustic emission signals in terms of short-term and long-term features of events. We show that the transition from regular to slow ruptures can have an additional production from the critical rupture class similar to the direct observations of this phenomenon in the transparent samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate detailed sub-micron evolution of the interface due to the short-term evolution of rupture tip, which is represented by phenomenological description of the modularity rates. In addition, we found nucleation phase of each single event for most amplified events follows a nearly constant time scale, corresponding to initial strengthening of interfaces.

010       Challenges on Probabilistic Modeling for Evolving Networks
021       With the emerging of new networks, such as wireless sensor networks, vehicle networks, P2P networks, cloud computing, mobile Internet, or social networks, the network dynamics and complexity expands from system design, hardware, software, protocols, structures, integration, evolution, application, even to business goals. 
020       Thus the dynamics and uncertainty are unavoidable characteristics, which come from the regular network evolution and unexpected hardware defects, unavoidable software errors, incomplete management information and dependency relationship between the entities among the emerging complex networks. Due to the complexity of emerging networks, it is not always possible to build precise models in modeling and optimization (local and global) for networks. This paper presents a survey on probabilistic modeling for evolving networks and identifies the new challenges which emerge on the probabilistic models and optimization strategies in the potential application areas of network performance, network management and network security for evolving networks.

021       Web services represent a system with a huge number of units and many various and complex interactions. 
020       Complex networks as a tool for modelling and analyzing natural environments seem to be well adapted to such a complex system. To describe a set of Web services we propose three Web services network models based on the notions of dependency, interaction and similarity. Using the WS-NEXT extractor we instantiate the models with a collection of Web services descriptions. We take advantage of complex network properties to provide an analyzis of the Web services networks. Those networks and the knowledge of their toplogical properties can be exploited for the discovery and composition processes.

From a collection of publicly available WS descriptions, we extract syntactic and semantic WS interaction networks. We take advantage of tools from the complex network field to analyze them and determine their properties. We show that WS interaction networks exhibit some of the typical characteristics observed in real-world networks, such as short average distance between nodes and community structure. By comparing syntactic and semantic networks through their properties, we show the introduction of semantics in WS descriptions should improve the composition process.

010       Topological Properties of Web Services Similarity Networks
021       The number of publicly available Web services (WS) is continuously growing. 
020       To perform efficient WS discovery, it is desirable to organize the WS space. Works in this direction propose to group WS according to certain shared properties. Such groups commonly called communities are based either on similarity or on interaction between WS. In this paper we focus on the former, and propose a new network-based approach to extract communities from a WS collection. This process is three-stepped: first we define several similarity functions able to compare WS operations, second we use them to build so-called similarity networks, and third we identify communities under the form of specific structures in these networks. We apply our method on a collection of real-world WS and comment the resulting communities. Finally, we additionally provide an analysis and an interpretation of our similarity networks with a complex networks perspective.

010       Excitable elements controlled by noise and network structure
021       We study collective dynamics of complex networks of stochastic excitable elements, active rotators. 
020       In the thermodynamic limit of infinite number of elements, we apply a mean-field theory for the network and then use a Gaussian approximation to obtain a closed set of deterministic differential equations. These equations govern the order parameters of the network. We find that a uniform decrease in the number of connections per element in a homogeneous network merely shifts the bifurcation thresholds without producing qualitative changes in the network dynamics. In contrast, heterogeneity in the number of connections leads to bifurcations in the excitable regime. In particular we show that a critical value of noise intensity for the saddle-node bifurcation decreases with growing connectivity variance. The corresponding critical values for the onset of global oscillations (Hopf bifurcation) show a non-monotone dependency on the structural heterogeneity, displaying a minimum at moderate connectivity variances.

By comparing syntactic and semantic networks through their topological properties, we show the introduction of semantics in WS description allows modeling more accurately the dependencies between parameters, which in turn could lead to improved composition mining methods.

010       On Topological Structure of Web Services Networks for Composition
021       In order to deal efficiently with the exponential growth of the Web services landscape in composition life cycle activities, it is necessary to have a clear view of its main features. 
020       As for many situations where there is a lot of interacting entities, the complex networks paradigm is an appropriate approach to analyze the interactions between the multitudes of Web services. In this paper, we present and investigate the main interactions between semantic Web services models from the complex network perspective. Results show that both parameter and operation networks exhibit the main characteristics of typical real-world complex networks such as the small-world property and an inhomogeneous degree distribution. These results yield valuable insight in order to develop composition search algorithms, to deal with security threat in the composition process and on the phenomena which characterize its evolution.

010       Community Structure in Interaction Web Service Networks
021       Many real-world complex systems such as social, biological, information as well as technological systems results of a decentralized and unplanned evolution which leads to a common structuration. 
020       Irrespective of their origin, these so-called complex networks typically exhibit small-world and scale-free properties. Another common feature is their organisation into communities. In this paper, we introduce models of interaction networks based on the composition process of syntactic and semantic Web services. An extensive experimental study conducted on a benchmark of real Web services shows that these networks possess the typical properties of complex networks (small-world, scale-free). Unlike most social networks, they are not transitive. Using a representative sample of community detection algorithms, a community structuration is revealed. The comparative evaluation of the discovered community structures shows that they are very similar in terms of content. Furthermore, the analysis performed on the community structures and on the communities themselves, leads us to conclude that their topological properties are consistent.

010       Burstiness and spreading on temporal networks
021       We discuss how spreading processes on temporal networks are impacted by the shape of their inter-event time distributions. 
020       Through simple mathematical arguments and toy examples, we find that the key factor is the ordering in which events take place, a property that tends to be affected by the bulk of the distributions and not only by their tail, as usually considered in the literature. We show that a detailed modeling of the temporal patterns observed in complex networks can change dramatically the properties of a spreading process, such as the ergodicity of a random walk process or the persistence of an epidemic.

010       High Level Pattern Classification via Tourist Walks in Networks
021       Complex networks refer to large-scale graphs with nontrivial connection patterns. 
020       The salient and interesting features that the complex network study offer in comparison to graph theory are the emphasis on the dynamical properties of the networks and the ability of inherently uncovering pattern formation of the vertices. In this paper, we present a hybrid data classification technique combining a low level and a high level classifier. The low level term can be equipped with any traditional classification techniques, which realize the classification task considering only physical features (e.g., geometrical or statistical features) of the input data. On the other hand, the high level term has the ability of detecting data patterns with semantic meanings. In this way, the classification is realized by means of the extraction of the underlying network's features constructed from the input data. As a result, the high level classification process measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training data. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture semantic meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a tourist walker in a networked environment. Specifically, a weighted combination of transient and cycle lengths generated by the tourist walk is employed for that end. Interestingly, our study shows that the proposed technique is able to further improve the already optimized performance of traditional classification techniques.

010       On 1/f^alpha power laws originating from linear neuronal cable theory:   power spectral densities of the soma potential, transmembrane current and   single-neuron contribution to the EEG
021       Power laws, that is, power spectral densities (PSDs) exhibiting 1/f^alpha behavior for large frequencies f, have commonly been observed in neural recordings. 
020       Power laws in noise spectra have not only been observed in microscopic recordings of neural membrane potentials and membrane currents, but also in macroscopic EEG (electroencephalographic) recordings. While complex network behavior has been suggested to be at the root of this phenomenon, we here demonstrate a possible origin of such power laws in the biophysical properties of single neurons described by the standard cable equation. Taking advantage of the analytical tractability of the so called ball and stick neuron model, we derive general expressions for the PSD transfer functions for a set of measures of neuronal activity: the soma membrane current, the current-dipole moment (corresponding to the single-neuron EEG contribution), and the soma membrane potential. These PSD transfer functions relate the PSDs of the respective measurements to the PSDs of the noisy input currents. With homogeneously distributed input currents across the neuronal membrane we find that all PSD transfer functions express asymptotic high-frequency 1/f^alpha power laws. The corresponding power-law exponents are analytically identified as alpha_inf^I = 1/2 for the soma membrane current, alpha_inf^p = 3/2 for the current-dipole moment, and alpha_inf^V = 2 for the soma membrane potential. These power-law exponents are found for arbitrary combinations of uncorrelated and correlated noisy input current (as long as both the dendrites and the soma receive some uncorrelated input currents). Comparison with available data suggests that the apparent power laws observed in experiments may stem from uncorrelated current sources, presumably intrinsic ion channels, which are homogeneously distributed across the neural membranes and themselves exhibit ...

010       Self-healing networks: redundancy and structure
021       We introduce the concept of self-healing in the field of complex networks. 
020       Obvious applications range from infrastructural to technological networks. By exploiting the presence of redundant links in recovering the connectivity of the system, we introduce self-healing capabilities through the application of distributed communication protocols granting the "smartness" of the system. We analyze the interplay between redundancies and smart reconfiguration protocols in improving the resilience of networked infrastructures to multiple failures; in particular, we measure the fraction of nodes still served for increasing levels of network damages. We study the effects of different connectivity patterns (planar square-grids, small-world, scale-free networks) on the healing performances. The study of small-world topologies shows us that the introduction of some long-range connections in the planar grids greatly enhances the resilience to multiple failures giving results comparable to the most resilient (but less realistic) scale-free structures.

010       Modeling self-sustained activity cascades in socio-technical networks
021       The ability to understand and eventually predict the emergence of information and activation cascades in social networks is core to complex socio-technical systems research. 
020       However, the complexity of social interactions makes this a challenging enterprise. Previous works on cascade models assume that the emergence of this collective phenomenon is related to the activity observed in the local neighborhood of individuals, but do not consider what determines the willingness to spread information in a time-varying process. Here we present a mechanistic model that accounts for the temporal evolution of the individual state in a simplified setup. We model the activity of the individuals as a complex network of interacting integrate-and-fire oscillators. The model reproduces the statistical characteristics of the cascades in real systems, and provides a framework to study time-evolution of cascades in a state-dependent activity scenario.

010       Effects of local population structure in a reaction-diffusion model of a   contact process on metapopulation networks
021       We investigate the effects of local population structure in reaction-diffusion processes representing a contact process (CP) on metapopulations represented as complex networks. 
020       Considering a model in which the nodes of a large scale network represent local populations defined in terms of a homogeneous graph, we show by means of extensive numerical simulations that the critical properties of the reaction-diffusion system are independent of the local population structure, even when this one is given by a ordered linear chain. This independence is confirmed by the perfect matching between numerical critical exponents and the results from a heterogeneous mean field theory suited, in principle, to describe situations of local homogeneous mixing. The analysis of several variations of the reaction-diffusion process allow to conclude the independence from population structure of the critical properties of CP-like models on metapopulations, and thus of the universality of the reaction-diffusion description of this kind of models.

010       Group detection in complex networks: An algorithm and comparison of the   state of the art
021       Complex real-world networks commonly reveal characteristic groups of nodes like communities and modules. 
020       These are of value in various applications, especially in the case of large social and information networks. However, while numerous community detection techniques have been presented in the literature, approaches for other groups of nodes are relatively rare and often limited in some way. We present a simple propagation-based algorithm for general group detection that requires no a priori knowledge and has near ideal complexity. The main novelty here is that different types of groups are revealed through an adequate hierarchical group refinement procedure. The proposed algorithm is validated on various synthetic and real-world networks, and rigorously compared against twelve other state-of-the-art approaches on group detection, hierarchy discovery and link prediction tasks. The algorithm is comparable to the state of the art in community detection, while superior in general group detection and link prediction. Based on the comparison, we also dis- cuss some prominent directions for future work on group detection in complex networks.

010       Pair quenched mean-field theory for the susceptible-infected-susceptible   model on complex networks
021       We present a quenched mean-field (QMF) theory for the dynamics of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model on complex networks where dynamical correlations between connected vertices are taken into account by means of a pair approximation. 
020       We present analytical expressions of the epidemic thresholds in the star and wheel graphs and in random regular networks. For random networks with a power law degree distribution, the thresholds are numerically determined via an eigenvalue problem. The pair and one-vertex QMF theories yield the same scaling for the thresholds as functions of the network size. However, comparisons with quasi-stationary simulations of the SIS dynamics on large networks show that the former is quantitatively much more accurate than the latter. Our results demonstrate the central role played by dynamical correlations on the epidemic spreading and introduce an efficient way to theoretically access the thresholds of very large networks that can be extended to dynamical processes in general.

010       Degree Distribution in Quantum Walks on Complex Networks
021       In this theoretical study, we analyze quantum walks on complex networks, which model network-based processes ranging from quantum computing to biology and even sociology. 
020       Specifically, we analytically relate the average long time probability distribution for the location of a unitary quantum walker to that of a corresponding classical walker. The distribution of the classical walker is proportional to the distribution of degrees, which measures the connectivity of the network nodes and underlies many methods for analyzing classical networks including website ranking. The quantum distribution becomes exactly equal to the classical distribution when the walk has zero energy and at higher energies the difference, the so-called quantumness, is bounded by the energy of the initial state. We give an example for which the quantumness equals a Renyi entropy of the normalized weighted degrees, guiding us to regimes for which the classical degree-dependent result is recovered and others for which quantum effects dominate.

010       Relationships between eigen and complex network techniques for the   statistical analysis of climate data
021       Eigen techniques such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF) or coupled pattern (CP) analysis have been frequently used for detecting patterns in multivariate climatological data sets. 
020       Recently, statistical methods originating from the theory of complex networks have been employed for the very same purpose of spatio-temporal analysis. This climate network analysis is usually based on the same set of similarity matrices as is used in classical EOF or CP analysis, e.g., the correlation matrix of a single climatological field or the cross-correlation matrix between two distinct climatological fields. In this study, formal relationships between both eigen and network approaches are derived and illustrated using exemplary data sets. These results allow to pinpoint that climate network analysis can complement classical eigen techniques and provides substantial additional information on the higher-order structure of statistical interrelationships in climatological data sets. Hence, climate networks are a valuable supplement to the statistical toolbox of the climatologist, particularly for making sense out of very large data sets such as those generated by satellite observations and climate model intercomparison exercises.

010       Controlling self-organized criticality in complex networks
021       A control scheme to reduce the size of avalanches of the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model on complex networks is proposed. 
020       Three network types are considered: those proposed by Erd\H{o}s-Renyi, Goh-Kahng-Kim, and a real network representing the main connections of the electrical power grid of the western United States. The control scheme is based on the idea of triggering avalanches in the highest degree nodes that are near to become critical. We show that this strategy works in the sense that the dissipation of mass occurs most locally avoiding larger avalanches. We also compare this strategy with a random strategy where the nodes are chosen randomly. Although the random control has some ability to reduce the probability of large avalanches, its performance is much worse than the one based on the choice of the highest degree nodes. Finally, we argue that the ability of the proposed control scheme is related to its ability to reduce the concentration of mass on the network.

020       Rev. E, {\bf 75}, 061110 (2007)] rather than the traditional majority-vote with noise [Jos\'e M\'ario de Oliveira, J. Stat. Phys. {\bf 66}, 273 (1992)]. The critical temperature and the critical exponents for this transition rate are obtained from extensive Monte Carlo simulations and with a finite size scaling analysis. The calculated values of the critical temperatures Binder cumulant are $T_c=0.363(2)$ and $U_4^*=0.577(4)$; $T_c=0.651(3)$ and $U_4^*=0.612(5)$; and $T_c=0.667(2)$ and $U_4^*=0.613(5)$ for ($3,12^2$), ($4,6,12$) and ($4,8^2$) lattices, respectively. The critical exponents $\beta/\nu$, $\gamma/\nu$ and $1/\nu$ for this model are $0.237(6)$, $0.73(10)$, and $ 0.83(5)$; $0.105(8)$, $1.28(11)$, and $1.16(5)$; $0.113(2)$, $1.60(4)$, and $0.84(6)$ for ($3,12^2$), ($4,6,12$) and ($4,8^2$) lattices, respectively. These results differ from the usual Ising model results and the majority-vote model on so-far studied regular lattices or complex networks.

010       On the Effects of Lag-Times in Networks Constructed from Similarities of   Monthly Fluctuations of Climate Fields
021       The complex network framework has been successfully applied to the analysis of climatological data, providing, for example, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying reduced predictability during El Ni\~no or La Ni\~na years. 
020       Despite the large interest that climate networks have attracted, several issues remain to be investigated. Here we focus in the influence of the periodic solar forcing in climate networks constructed via similarities of monthly averaged surface air temperature (SAT) anomalies. We shift the time series in each pair of nodes such as to superpose their seasonal cycles. In this way, when two nodes are located in different hemispheres we are able to quantify the similarity of SAT anomalies during the winters and during the summers. We find that data time-shifting does not significantly modify the network area weighted connectivity (AWC), which is the fraction of the total area of the Earth to which each node is con- nected. This unexpected network property can be understood in terms of how data time-shifting modifies the strength of the links connecting geographical regions in different hemispheres, and how these modifications are washed out by averaging the AWC.

010       The linear noise approximation for reaction-diffusion systems on   networks
021       Stochastic reaction-diffusion models can be analytically studied on complex networks using the linear noise approximation. 
020       This is illustrated through the use of a specific stochastic model, which displays traveling waves in its deterministic limit. The role of stochastic fluctuations is investigated and shown to drive the emergence of stochastic waves beyond the region of the instability predicted from the deterministic theory. Simulations are performed to test the theoretical results and are analyzed via a generalized Fourier transform algorithm. This transform is defined using the eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian defined on the network. A peak in the numerical power spectrum of the fluctuations is observed in quantitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.

010       Dynamical Systems to Monitor Complex Networks in Continuous Time
021       In many settings it is appropriate to treat the evolution of pairwise interactions over continuous time. 
020       We show that new Katz-style centrality measures can be derived in this context via solutions to a nonautonomous ODE driven by the network dynamics. This allows us to identify and track, at any resolution, the most influential nodes in terms of broadcasting and receiving information through time dependent links. In addition to the classical notion of attenuation across edges used in the static Katz centrality measure, the ODE also allows for attenuation over time, so that real time "running measures" can be computed. With regard to computational efficiency, we explain why it is cheaper to track good receivers of information than good broadcasters. We illustrate the new measures on a large scale voice call network, where key features are discovered that are not evident from snapshots or aggregates.

010       Path diversity improves the identification of influential spreaders
021       Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks is a crucial problem which relates to wide applications. 
020       Many methods based on the global information such as $k$-shell and PageRank have been applied to rank spreaders. However, most of related previous works overwhelmingly focus on the number of paths for propagation, while whether the paths are diverse enough is usually overlooked. Generally, the spreading ability of a node might not be strong if its propagation depends on one or two paths while the other paths are dead ends. In this Letter, we introduced the concept of path diversity and find that it can largely improve the ranking accuracy. We further propose a local method combining the information of path number and path diversity to identify influential nodes in complex networks. This method is shown to outperform many well-known methods in both undirected and directed networks. Moreover, the efficiency of our method makes it possible to be applied to very large systems.

010       Deciphering the global organization of clustering in real complex   networks
021       We uncover the global organization of clustering in real complex networks. 
020       As it happens with other fundamental properties of networks such as the degree distribution, we find that real networks are neither completely random nor ordered with respect to clustering, although they tend to be closer to maximally random architectures. We reach this conclusion by comparing the global structure of clustering in real networks with that in maximally random and in maximally ordered clustered graphs. The former are produced with an exponential random graph model that maintains correlations among adjacent edges at the minimum needed to conform with the expected clustering spectrum; the later with a random model that arranges triangles in cliques inducing highly ordered structures. To compare the global organization of clustering in real and model networks, we compute $m$-core landscapes, where the $m$-core is defined, akin to the $k$-core, as the maximal subgraph with edges participating at least in $m$ triangles. This property defines a set of nested subgraphs that, contrarily to $k$-cores, is able to distinguish between hierarchical and modular architectures. To visualize the $m$-core decomposition we developed the LaNet-vi 3.0 tool.

010       Cellular-Based Statistical Model for Mobile Dispersion
021       While analyzing mobile systems we often approximate the actual coverage surface and assume an ideal cell shape. 
020       In a multi-cellular network, because of its tessellating nature, a hexagon is more preferred than a circular geometry. Despite this reality, perhaps due to the inherent simplicity, only a model for circular based random spreading is available. However, if used, this results an unfair terminal distribution for non-circular contours. Therefore, in this paper we specifically derived an unbiased node density model for a hexagon. We then extended the principle and established stochastic ways to handle sectored cells. Next, based on these mathematical findings, we created a generic modeling tool that can support a complex network with varying position, capacity, size, user density, and sectoring capability. Last, simulation was used to verify the theoretical analysis.

010       Spatially distributed social complex networks
021       We propose a bare-bones stochastic model that takes into account both the geographical distribution of people within a country and their complex network of connections. 
020       The model, which is designed to give rise to a scale-free network of social connections and to visually resemble the geographical spread seen in satellite pictures of the Earth at night, gives rise to a power-law distribution for the ranking of cities by population size (but for the largest cities) and reflects the notion that highly connected individuals tend to live in highly populated areas. It also yields some interesting insights regarding Gibrat's law for the rates of city growth (by population size), in partial support of the findings in a recent analysis of real data [Rozenfeld et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 18702 (2008)]. The model produces a nontrivial relation between city population and city population density and a superlinear relationship between social connectivity and city population, both of which seem quite in line with real data.

010       Correlation of Automorphism Group Size and Topological Properties with   Program-size Complexity Evaluations of Graphs and Complex Networks
021       We show that numerical approximations of Kolmogorov complexity (K) applied to graph adjacency matrices capture some group-theoretic and topological properties of graphs and empirical networks ranging from metabolic to social networks. 
020       That K and the size of the group of automorphisms of a graph are correlated opens up interesting connections to problems in computational geometry, and thus connects several measures and concepts from complexity science. We show that approximations of K characterise synthetic and natural networks by their generating mechanisms, assigning lower algorithmic randomness to complex network models (Watts-Strogatz and Barabasi-Albert networks) and high Kolmogorov complexity to (random) Erdos-Renyi graphs. We derive these results via two different Kolmogorov complexity approximation methods applied to the adjacency matrices of the graphs and networks. The methods used are the traditional lossless compression approach to Kolmogorov complexity, and a normalised version of a Block Decomposition Method (BDM) measure, based on algorithmic probability theory.

010       Graph Metrics for Temporal Networks
021       Temporal networks, i.e., networks in which the interactions among a set of elementary units change over time, can be modelled in terms of time-varying graphs, which are time-ordered sequences of graphs over a set of nodes. 
020       In such graphs, the concepts of node adjacency and reachability crucially depend on the exact temporal ordering of the links. Consequently, all the concepts and metrics proposed and used for the characterisation of static complex networks have to be redefined or appropriately extended to time-varying graphs, in order to take into account the effects of time ordering on causality. In this chapter we discuss how to represent temporal networks and we review the definitions of walks, paths, connectedness and connected components valid for graphs in which the links fluctuate over time. We then focus on temporal node-node distance, and we discuss how to characterise link persistence and the temporal small-world behaviour in this class of networks. Finally, we discuss the extension of classic centrality measures, including closeness, betweenness and spectral centrality, to the case of time-varying graphs, and we review the work on temporal motifs analysis and the definition of modularity for temporal graphs.

010       The Role of Trends in Evolving Networks
021       Modeling complex networks has been the focus of much research for over a decade. 
020       Preferential attachment (PA) is considered a common explanation to the self organization of evolving networks, suggesting that new nodes prefer to attach to more popular nodes. The PA model results in broad degree distributions, found in many networks, but cannot explain other common properties such as: The growth of nodes arriving late and Clustering (community structure). Here we show that when the tendency of networks to adhere to trends is incorporated into the PA model, it can produce networks with such properties. Namely, in trending networks, newly arriving nodes may become central at random, forming new clusters. In particular, we show that when the network is young it is more susceptible to trends, but even older networks may have trendy new nodes that become central in their structure. Alternatively, networks can be seen as composed of two parts: static, governed by a power law degree distribution, and a dynamic part governed by trends, as we show on Wiki pages. Our results also show that the arrival of trending new nodes not only creates new clusters, but also has an effect on the relative importance and centrality of all other nodes in the network. This can explain a variety of real world networks in economics, social and online networks, and cultural networks. Products popularity, formed by the network of people's opinions, exhibit these properties. Some lines of products are increasingly susceptible to trends and hence to shifts in popularity, while others are less trendy and hence more stable. We believe that our findings have a big impact on our understanding of real networks.

010       Generative Model Selection Using a Scalable and Size-Independent Complex   Network Classifier
021       Real networks exhibit nontrivial topological features such as heavy-tailed degree distribution, high clustering, and small-worldness. 
020       Researchers have developed several generative models for synthesizing artificial networks that are structurally similar to real networks. An important research problem is to identify the generative model that best fits to a target network. In this paper, we investigate this problem and our goal is to select the model that is able to generate graphs similar to a given network instance. By the means of generating synthetic networks with seven outstanding generative models, we have utilized machine learning methods to develop a decision tree for model selection. Our proposed method, which is named "Generative Model Selection for Complex Networks" (GMSCN), outperforms existing methods with respect to accuracy, scalability and size-independence.

010       Optimal Sensor and Actuator Placement in Complex Dynamical Networks
021       Controllability and observability have long been recognized as fundamental structural properties of dynamical systems, but have recently seen renewed interest in the context of large, complex networks of dynamical systems. 
020       A basic problem is sensor and actuator placement: choose a subset from a finite set of possible placements to optimize some real-valued controllability and observability metrics of the network. Surprisingly little is known about the structure of such combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we show that an important class of metrics based on the controllability and observability Gramians has a strong structural property that allows efficient global optimization: the mapping from possible placements to the trace of the associated Gramian is a modular set function. We illustrate the results via placement of power electronic actuators in a model of the European power grid.

010       Analysis of communities in a mythological social network
021       The intriguing nature of classical Homeric narratives has always fascinated the occidental culture contributing to philosophy, history, mythology and straight forwardly to literature. 
020       However what would be so intriguing about Homer's narratives' At a first gaze we shall recognize the very literal appeal and aesthetic pleasure presented on every page across Homer's chants in Odyssey and rhapsodies in Iliad. Secondly we may perceive a biased aspect of its stories contents, varying from real-historical to fictional-mythological. To encompass this glance, there are some new archeological finding that supports historicity of some events described within Iliad, and consequently to Odyssey. Considering these observations and using complex network theory concepts, we managed to built and analyze a social network gathered across the classical epic, Odyssey of Homer. Longing for further understanding, topological quantities were collected in order to classify its social network qualitatively into real or fictional. It turns out that most of the found properties belong to real social networks besides assortativity and giant component's size. In order to test the network's possibilities to be real, we removed some mythological members that could imprint a fictional aspect on the network. Carrying on this maneuver the modified social network resulted on assortative mixing and reduction of the giant component, as expected for real social networks. Overall we observe that Odyssey might be an amalgam of fictional elements plus real based human relations, which corroborates other author's findings for Iliad and archeological evidences.

010       Significant Scales in Community Structure
021       Many complex networks show signs of modular structure, uncovered by community detection. 
020       Although many methods succeed in revealing various partitions, it remains difficult to detect at what scale some partition is significant. This problem shows foremost in multi-resolution methods. We here introduce an efficient method for scanning for resolutions in one such method. Additionally, we introduce the notion of "significance" of a partition, based on subgraph probabilities. Significance is independent of the exact method used, so could also be applied in other methods, and can be interpreted as the gain in encoding a graph by making use of a partition. Using significance, we can determine "good" resolution parameters, which we demonstrate on benchmark networks. Moreover, optimizing significance itself also shows excellent performance. We demonstrate our method on voting data from the European Parliament. Our analysis suggests the European Parliament has become increasingly ideologically divided and that nationality plays no role.

010       Spectral analysis and slow spreading dynamics on complex networks
021       The Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is one of the simplest memoryless system for describing information/epidemic spreading phenomena with competing creation and spontaneous annihilation reactions. 
020       The effect of quenched disorder on the dynamical behavior has recently been compared to quenched mean-field (QMF) approximations in scale-free networks. QMF can take into account topological heterogeneity and clustering effects of the activity in the steady state by spectral decomposition analysis of the adjacency matrix. Therefore, it can provide predictions on possible rare-region effects, thus on the occurrence of slow dynamics. I compare QMF results of SIS with simulations on various large dimensional graphs. In particular, I show that for Erd\H os-R\'enyi graphs this method predicts correctly the epidemic threshold and the rare-region effects. Griffiths Phases emerge if the graph is fragmented or if we apply strong, exponentially suppressing weighting scheme on the edges. The latter model describes the connection time distributions in the face-to-face experiments. In case of generalized Barab\'asi-Albert type of networks with aging connections strong rare-region effects and numerical evidence for Griffiths Phase dynamics are shown.

010       Multiplex PageRank
021       Many complex systems can be described as multiplex networks in which the same nodes can interact with one another in different layers, thus forming a set of interacting and co-evolving networks. 
020       Examples of such multiplex systems are social networks where people are involved in different types of relationships and interact through various forms of communication media. The ranking of nodes in multiplex networks is one of the most pressing and challenging tasks that research on complex networks is currently facing. When pairs of nodes can be connected through multiple links and in multiple layers, the ranking of nodes should necessarily reflect the importance of nodes in one layer as well as their importance in other interdependent layers. In this paper, we draw on the idea of biased random walks to define the Multiplex PageRank centrality measure in which the effects of the interplay between networks on the centrality of nodes are directly taken into account. In particular, depending on the intensity of the interaction between layers, we define the Additive, Multiplicative, Combined, and Neutral versions of Multiplex PageRank, and show how each version reflects the extent to which the importance of a node in one layer affects the importance the node can gain in another layer. We discuss these measures and apply them to an online multiplex social network. Findings indicate that taking the multiplex nature of the network into account helps uncover the emergence of rankings of nodes that differ from the rankings obtained from one single layer. Results provide support in favor of the salience of multiplex centrality measures, like Multiplex PageRank, for assessing the prominence of nodes embedded in multiple interacting networks, and for shedding a new light on structural properties that would otherwise remain undetected if each of the interacting networks were analyzed in isolation.

010       A coevolving model based on preferential triadic closure for social   media networks
021       The dynamical origin of complex networks, i.e., the underlying principles governing network evolution, is a crucial issue in network study. 
020       In this paper, by carrying out analysis to the temporal data of Flickr and Epinions--two typical social media networks, we found that the dynamical pattern in neighborhood, especially the formation of triadic links, plays a dominant role in the evolution of networks. We thus proposed a coevolving dynamical model for such networks, in which the evolution is only driven by the local dynamics--the preferential triadic closure. Numerical experiments verified that the model can reproduce global properties which are qualitatively consistent with the empirical observations.

010       UDC in Action
021       The UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) is not only a classification language with a long history; it also presents a complex cognitive system worthy of the attention of complexity theory. 
020       The elements of the UDC: classes, auxiliaries, and operations are combined into symbolic strings, which in essence represent a complex networks of concepts. This network forms a backbone of ordering of knowledge and at the same time allows expression of different perspectives on various products of human knowledge production. In this paper we look at UDC strings derived from the holdings of libraries. In particular we analyse the subject headings of holdings of the university library in Leuven, and an extraction of UDC numbers from the OCLC WorldCat. Comparing those sets with the Master Reference File, we look into the length of strings, the occurrence of different auxiliary signs, and the resulting connections between UDC classes. We apply methods and representations from complexity theory. Mapping out basic statistics on UDC classes as used in libraries from a point of view of complexity theory bears different benefits. Deploying its structure could serve as an overview and basic information for users among the nature and focus of specific collections. A closer view into combined UDC numbers reveals the complex nature of the UDC as an example for a knowledge ordering system, which deserves future exploration from a complexity theoretical perspective.

010       Characteristic exponents of complex networks
021       We present a novel way to characterize the structure of complex networks by studying the statistical properties of the trajectories of random walks over them. 
020       We consider time series corresponding to different properties of the nodes visited by the walkers. We show that the analysis of the fluctuations of these time series allows to define a set of characteristic exponents which capture the local and global organization of a network. This approach provides a way of solving two classical problems in network science, namely the systematic classification of networks, and the identification of the salient properties of growing networks. The results contribute to the construction of a unifying framework for the investigation of the structure and dynamics of complex systems.

021       Patterns of topological arrangement are widely used for both animal and human brains in the learning process. 
020       Nevertheless, automatic learning techniques frequently overlook these patterns. In this paper, we apply a learning technique based on the structural organization of the data in the attribute space to the problem of discriminating the senses of 10 polysemous words. Using two types of characterization of meanings, namely semantical and topological approaches, we have observed significative accuracy rates in identifying the suitable meanings in both techniques. Most importantly, we have found that the characterization based on the deterministic tourist walk improves the disambiguation process when one compares with the discrimination achieved with traditional complex networks measurements such as assortativity and clustering coefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first time that such deterministic walk has been applied to such a kind of problem. Therefore, our finding suggests that the tourist walk characterization may be useful in other related applications.

010       A surrogate for networks -- How scale-free is my scale-free network?
021       Complex networks are now being studied in a wide range of disciplines across science and technology. 
020       In this paper we propose a method by which one can probe the properties of experimentally obtained network data. Rather than just measuring properties of a network inferred from data, we aim to ask how typical is that network? What properties of the observed network are typical of all such scale free networks, and which are peculiar? To do this we propose a series of methods that can be used to generate statistically likely complex networks which are both similar to the observed data and also consistent with an underlying null-hypothesis -- for example a particular degree distribution. There is a direct analogy between the approach we propose here and the surrogate data methods applied to nonlinear time series data.

010       Adaptive coupling induced multi-stable states in complex networks
021       Adaptive coupling, where the coupling is dynamical and depends on the behaviour of the oscillators in a complex system, is one of the most crucial factors to control the dynamics and streamline various processes in complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we have demonstrated the occurrence of multi-stable states in a system of identical phase oscillators that are dynamically coupled. We find that the multi-stable state is comprised of a two cluster synchronization state where the clusters are in anti-phase relationship with each other and a desynchronization state. We also find that the phase relationship between the oscillators is asymptotically stable irrespective of whether there is synchronization or desynchronization in the system. The time scale of the coupling affects the size of the clusters in the two cluster state. We also investigate the effect of both the coupling asymmetry and plasticity asymmetry on the multi-stable states. In the absence of coupling asymmetry, increasing the plasticity asymmetry causes the system to go from a two clustered state to a desynchronization state and then to a two clustered state. Further, the coupling asymmetry, if present, also affects this transition. We also analytically find the occurrence of the above mentioned multi-stable-desynchronization-multi-stable state transition. A brief discussion on the phase evolution of nonidentical oscillators is also provided. Our analytical results are in good agreement with our numerical observations.

010       Exploring the limits of community detection strategies in complex   networks
021       The characterization of network community structure has profound implications in several scientific areas. 
020       Therefore, testing the algorithms developed to establish the optimal division of a network into communities is a fundamental problem in the field. We performed here a highly detailed evaluation of community detection algorithms, which has two main novelties: 1) using complex closed benchmarks, which provide precise ways to assess whether the solutions generated by the algorithms are optimal; and, 2) A novel type of analysis, based on hierarchically clustering the solutions suggested by multiple community detection algorithms, which allows to easily visualize how different are those solutions. Surprise, a global parameter that evaluates the quality of a partition, confirms the power of these analyses. We show that none of the community detection algorithms tested provide consistently optimal results in all networks and that Surprise maximization, obtained by combining multiple algorithms, obtains quasi-optimal performances in these difficult benchmarks.

010       Activity clocks: spreading dynamics on temporal networks of human   contact
021       Dynamical processes on time-varying complex networks are key to understanding and modeling a broad variety of processes in socio-technical systems. 
020       Here we focus on empirical temporal networks of human proximity and we aim at understanding the factors that, in simulation, shape the arrival time distribution of simple spreading processes. Abandoning the notion of wall-clock time in favour of node-specific clocks based on activity exposes robust statistical patterns in the arrival times across different social contexts. Using randomization strategies and generative models constrained by data, we show that these patterns can be understood in terms of heterogeneous inter-event time distributions coupled with heterogeneous numbers of events per edge. We also show, both empirically and by using a synthetic dataset, that significant deviations from the above behavior can be caused by the presence of edge classes with strong activity correlations.

010       Fluctuations of motifs and non self-averaging in complex networks. A   self- vs non-self-averaging phase transition scenario
021       Complex networks have been mostly characterized from the point of view of the degree distribution of their nodes and a few other motifs (or modules), with a special attention to triangles and cliques. 
020       The most exotic phenomena have been observed when the exponent $\gamma$ of the associated power law degree-distribution is sufficiently small. In particular, a zero percolation threshold takes place for $\gamma&lt;3$, and an anomalous critical behavior sets in for $\gamma&lt;5$. In this Letter we prove that in sparse scale-free networks characterized by a cut-off scaling with the sistem size $N$, relative fluctuations are actually never negligible: given a motif $\Gamma$, we analyze the relative fluctuations $R_{\Gamma}$ of the associated density of $\Gamma$, and we show that there exists an interval in $\gamma$, $[\gamma_1,\gamma_2]$, where $R_{\Gamma}$ does not go to zero in the thermodynamic limit, where $\gamma_1\approx k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $\gamma_2\approx 2 k_{\mathrm{max}}$, $k_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{max}}$ being the smallest and the largest degree of $\Gamma$, respectively. Remarkably, in $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ $R_{\Gamma}$ diverges, implying the instability of $\Gamma$ to small perturbations.

010       Algorithm independent bounds on community detection problems and   associated transitions in stochastic block model graphs
021       We derive rigorous bounds for well-defined community structure in complex networks for a stochastic block model (SBM) benchmark. 
020       In particular, we analyze the effect of inter-community "noise" (inter-community edges) on any "community detection" algorithm's ability to correctly group nodes assigned to a planted partition, a problem which has been proven to be NP complete in a standard rendition. Our result does not rely on the use of any one particular algorithm nor on the analysis of the limitations of inference. Rather, we turn the problem on its head and work backwards to examine when, in the first place, well defined structure may exist in SBMs.The method that we introduce here could potentially be applied to other computational problems. The objective of community detection algorithms is to partition a given network into optimally disjoint subgraphs (or communities). Similar to k-SAT and other combinatorial optimization problems, "community detection" exhibits different phases. Networks that lie in the "unsolvable phase" lack well-defined structure and thus have no partition that is meaningful. Solvable systems splinter into two disparate phases: those in the "hard" phase and those in the "easy" phase. As befits its name, within the easy phase, a partition is easy to achieve by known algorithms. When a network lies in the hard phase, it still has an underlying structure yet finding a meaningful partition which can be checked in polynomial time requires an exhaustive computational effort that rapidly increases with the size of the graph. When taken together, (i) the rigorous results that we report here on when graphs have an underlying structure and (ii) recent results concerning the limits of rather general algorithms, suggest bounds on the hard phase.

010       Realistic Control of Network Dynamics
021       The control of complex networks is of paramount importance in areas as diverse as ecosystem management, emergency response, and cell reprogramming. 
020       A fundamental property of networks is that perturbations to one node can affect other nodes, potentially causing the entire system to change behavior or fail. Here, we show that it is possible to exploit the same principle to control network behavior. Our approach accounts for the nonlinear dynamics inherent to real systems, and allows bringing the system to a desired target state even when this state is not directly accessible due to constraints that limit the allowed interventions. Applications show that this framework permits reprogramming a network to a desired task as well as rescuing networks from the brink of failure---which we illustrate through the mitigation of cascading failures in a power-grid network and the identification of potential drug targets in a signaling network of human cancer.

021       We perform the analysis of scientific collaboration at the level of universities. 
020       The scope of this study is to answer two fundamental questions: (i) can one indicate a category (i.e., a scientific discipline) that has the greatest impact on the rank of the university and (ii) do the best universities collaborate with the best ones only? Using two university ranking lists (ARWU and QS) as well as data from the Science Citation Index we show how the number of publications in certain categories correlates with the university rank. Moreover, using complex networks analysis, we give hints that the scientific collaboration is highly embedded in the physical space and the number of common papers decays with the distance between them. We also show the strength of the ties between universities is proportional to product of their total number of publications.

020       In this way, starting from economic reasoning, we obtain a sound interpretation of the typical network variables in terms of thermodynamic quantities together with a strong consistency with microeconomic theory, and in particular with Walrasian general equilibrium theory. In our formalism, naturally arises the interpretation of the temperature $T$ as a quantification of economic disequilibrium, which can indeed coexist with statistical equilibrium.

021       This letter investigates the epidemic spreading in two-vectors propagation network (TPN). 
020       We propose detailed theoretical analysis that allows us to accurately calculate the epidemic threshold and outbreak size. It is found that the epidemics can spread across the TPN even if two sub-single-vector propagation networks (SPNs) of TPN are well below their respective epidemic thresholds. Strong positive degree-degree correlation of nodes in TPN could lead to a much lower epidemic threshold and a relatively smaller outbreak size. However, the average similarity between the neighbors from different SPNs of nodes has no effect on the epidemic threshold and outbreak size.

010       Spectral properties of the Laplacian of multiplex networks
021       One of the more challenging tasks in the understanding of dynamical properties of models on top of complex networks is to capture the precise role of multiplex topologies. 
020       In a recent paper, Gomez et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 028701 (2013)] proposed a framework for the study of diffusion processes in such networks. Here, we extend the previous framework to deal with general configurations in several layers of networks, and analyze the behavior of the spectrum of the Laplacian of the full multiplex. We derive an interesting decoupling of the problem that allow us to unravel the role played by the interconnections of the multiplex in the dynamical processes on top of them. Capitalizing on this decoupling we perform an asymptotic analysis that allow us to derive analytical expressions for the full spectrum of eigenvalues. This spectrum is used to gain insight into physical phenomena on top of multiplex, specifically, diffusion processes and synchronizability.

Included here is ready-to-use software that can be applied to identify eligible control interventions in a general system described by coupled ordinary differential equations, whose specific form can be specified by the user. The algorithm is highly scalable, with the computational cost scaling as the number of dynamical variables to the power 2.5.

010       Structure controllability of complex network based on preferential   matching
021       Minimum driver node sets (MDSs) play an important role in studying structural controllability of complex network. 
020       Existing research claims that driver nodes tend to avoid high degree nodes. In this paper, we discover that MDS may be composed of high- and medium- degree nodes. We propose a preferential matching algorithm to find MDS satisfying a specific topological property. Our experiments show that the average degree of some MDSs can be obviously higher than that of the whole network by using this method. Moreover, the average degree of MDS of some networks can be higher than or equal to that of networks even using the traditional matching algorithm. We find that whether the driver nodes tend to avoid high degree nodes depends on the orientation of edges in a network. This result complements previous works and shows a new perspective to explore the controllability of complex network.

021       Adaptively monitoring the states of nodes in a large complex network is of interest in domains such as national security, public health, and energy grid management. 
020       Here, we present an information theoretic adaptive tracking and sampling framework that recursively selects measurements using the feedback from performing inference on a dynamic Bayesian Network. We also present conditions for the existence of a network specific, observation dependent, phase transition in the updated posterior of hidden node states resulting from actively monitoring the network. Since traditional epidemic thresholds are derived using observation independent Markov chains, the threshold of the posterior should more accurately model the true phase transition of a network. The adaptive tracking framework and epidemic threshold should provide insight into modeling the dynamic response of the updated posterior to active intervention and control policies while monitoring modern complex networks.

010       A new method for comparing rankings through complex networks: Model and   analysis of competitiveness of major European soccer leagues
021       In this paper we show a new technique to analyze families of rankings. 
020       In particular we focus on sports rankings and, more precisely, on soccer leagues. We consider that two teams compete when they change their relative positions in consecutive rankings. This allows to define a graph by linking teams that compete. We show how to use some structural properties of this competitivity graph to measure to what extend the teams in a league compete. These structural properties are the mean degree, the mean strength and the clustering coefficient. We give a generalization of the Kendall's correlation coefficient to more than two rankings. We also show how to make a dynamic analysis of a league and how to compare different leagues. We apply this technique to analyze the four major European soccer leagues: Bundesliga, Italian Lega, Spanish Liga, and Premier League. We compare our results with the classical analysis of sport ranking based on measures of competitive balance.

010       Characteristic times of biased random walks on complex networks
021       We consider degree-biased random walkers whose probability to move from a node to one of its neighbors of degree $k$ is proportional to $k^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a tuning parameter. 
020       We study both numerically and analytically three types of characteristic times, namely: i) the time the walker needs to come back to the starting node, ii) the time it takes to visit a given node for the first time, and iii) the time it takes to visit all the nodes of the network. We consider a large data set of real-world networks and we show that the value of $\alpha$ which minimizes the three characteristic times is different from the value $\alpha_{\rm min}=-1$ analytically found for uncorrelated networks in the mean-field approximation. In addition to this, we found that assortative networks have preferentially a value of $\alpha_{\rm min}$ in the range $[-1,-0.5]$, while disassortative networks have $\alpha_{\rm min}$ in the range $[-0.5, 0]$. We derive an analytical relation between the degree correlation exponent $\nu$ and the optimal bias value $\alpha_{\rm min}$, which works well for real-world assortative networks. When only local information is available, degree-biased random walks can guarantee smaller characteristic times than the classical unbiased random walks, by means of an appropriate tuning of the motion bias.

010       Quantification and Comparison of Degree Distributions in Complex   Networks
021       The degree distribution is an important characteristic of complex networks. 
020       In many applications, quantification of degree distribution in the form of a fixed-length feature vector is a necessary step. On the other hand, we often need to compare the degree distribution of two given networks and extract the amount of similarity between the two distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for quantification of the degree distributions in complex networks. Based on this quantification method,a new distance function is also proposed for degree distributions, which captures the differences in the overall structure of the two given distributions. The proposed method is able to effectively compare networks even with different scales, and outperforms the state of the art methods considerably, with respect to the accuracy of the distance function.

010       Learning an Integrated Distance Metric for Comparing Structure of   Complex Networks
021       Graph comparison plays a major role in many network applications. 
020       We often need a similarity metric for comparing networks according to their structural properties. Various network features - such as degree distribution and clustering coefficient - provide measurements for comparing networks from different points of view, but a global and integrated distance metric is still missing. In this paper, we employ distance metric learning algorithms in order to construct an integrated distance metric for comparing structural properties of complex networks. According to natural witnesses of network similarities (such as network categories) the distance metric is learned by the means of a dataset of some labeled real networks. For evaluating our proposed method which is called NetDistance, we applied it as the distance metric in K-nearest-neighbors classification. Empirical results show that NetDistance outperforms previous methods, at least 20 percent, with respect to precision.

010       The resilience of interdependent transportation networks under targeted   attack
021       Modern world builds on the resilience of interdependent infrastructures characterized as complex networks. 
020       Recently, a framework for analysis of interdependent networks has been developed to explain the mechanism of resilience in interdependent networks. Here we extend this interdependent network model by considering flows in the networks and study the system's resilience under different attack strategies. In our model, nodes may fail due to either overload or loss of interdependency. Under the interaction between these two failure mechanisms, it is shown that interdependent scale-free networks show extreme vulnerability. The resilience of interdependent SF networks is found in our simulation much smaller than single SF network or interdependent SF networks without flows.

010       Factors determining nestedness in complex networks
021       Understanding the causes and effects of network structural features is a key task in deciphering complex systems. 
020       In this context, the property of network nestedness has aroused a fair amount of interest as regards ecological networks. Indeed, Bastolla et al. introduced a simple measure of network nestedness which opened the door to analytical understanding, allowing them to conclude that biodiversity is strongly enhanced in highly nested mutualistic networks. Here, we suggest a slightly refined version of such a measure and go on to study how it is influenced by the most basic structural properties of networks, such as degree distribution and degree-degree correlations (i.e. assortativity). We find that heterogeneity in the degree has a very strong influence on nestedness. Once such an influence has been discounted, we find that nestedness is strongly correlated with disassortativity and hence, as random (neutral) networks have been recently found to be naturally disassortative, they tend to be naturally nested just as the result of chance.

010       Mathematical models for epidemic spreading on complex networks
021       We propose a model for epidemic spreading on a finite complex network with a restriction to at most one contamination per time step. 
020       Because of a highly discrete character of the process, the analysis cannot use the continous approximation, widely exploited for most of the models. Using discrete approach we investigate the epidemic threshold and the quasi-stationary distribution. The main result is a theorem about mixing time for the process, which scales like logarithm of the network size and which is proportional to the inverse of the distance from the epidemic threshold. In order to present the model in the full context, we review modern approach to epidemic spreading modeling based on complex networks and present necessary information about random networks, discrete-time Markov chains and their quasi-stationary distributions.

010       Complex Network Approach to the Statistical Features of the Sunspot   Series
021       Complex network approaches have been recently developed as an alternative framework to study the statistical features of time-series data. 
020       We perform a visibility-graph analysis on both the daily and monthly sunspot series. Based on the data, we propose two ways to construct the network: one is from the original observable measurements and the other is from a negative-inverse-transformed series. The degree distribution of the derived networks for the strong maxima has clear non-Gaussian properties, while the degree distribution for minima is bimodal. The long-term variation of the cycles is reflected by hubs in the network which span relatively large time intervals. Based on standard network structural measures, we propose to characterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent events. The persistence range of the solar cycles has been identified over 15\,--\,1000 days by a power-law regime with scaling exponent $\gamma = 2.04$ of the occurrence time of the two subsequent and successive strong minima. In contrast, a persistent trend is not present in the maximal numbers, although maxima do have significant deviations from an exponential form. Our results suggest some new insights for evaluating existing models. The power-law regime suggested by the waiting times does indicate that there are some level of predictable patterns in the minima.

010       Explosive synchronization in weighted complex networks
021       The emergence of dynamical abrupt transitions in the macroscopic state of a system is currently a subject of the utmost interest. 
020       Given a set of phase oscillators networking with a generic wiring of connections and displaying a generic frequency distribution, we show how combining dynamical local information on frequency mismatches and global information on the graph topology suggests a judicious and yet practical weighting procedure which is able to induce and enhance explosive, irreversible, transitions to synchronization. We report extensive numerical and analytical evidence of the validity and scalability of such a procedure for different initial frequency distributions, for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, as well as for both linear and non linear weighting functions. We furthermore report on the possibility of parametrically controlling the width and extent of the hysteretic region of coexistence of the unsynchronized and synchronized states.

010       Clustering Coefficients in Multiplex Networks
021       Recent advances in the study of complex networked systems has highlighted that our interconnected world is made of networks that are coupled together through different layers that each stand for one type of interaction or system. 
020       Despite this situation, it is traditional to aggregate multiplex data into a single weighted network in order take advantage of existing tools. This is admittedly convenient, but it is also extremely problematic. In this paper, we generalize the concept of clustering coefficients for multiplex networks. We show how the layered structure of multiplex networks introduces a new degree of freedom that has a fundamental effect on transitivity. We compute our new multiplex clustering coefficients for several real multiplex networks and illustrate why generalizing monoplex concepts to multiplex networks must be done with great care.

010       Network Topologies of Financial Market During the Global Financial   Crisis
021       We consider the effects of the global financial crisis through a local Korean financial market around the 2008 crisis. 
020       We analyze 185 individual stock prices belonging to the KOSPI (Korea Composite Stock Price Index), cosidering three time periods: the time before, during, and after the crisis. The complex networks generate from the fully connected correlation network by using the cross-correlation coefficients among the stock price time series of the companies. We generate the threshold networks (TN), the minimal spanning tees (MST), and the hierarchical network (HN) from the fully connected cross-correlation networks. By assigning a threshold value of the cross-correlation coefficient, we obtain the threshold networks. We observe the power law of the degree distribution in the limited range of the threshold. The degree distribution of the largest cluster in the threshold networks during the crisis is fatter than other periods. The clustering coefficient of the threshold networks follows the power law in the scaling range. We also generate the minimal spanning trees from the fully connected correlation networks. The MST during the crisis period shrinks in comparison to the periods before and after the crisis. The cophenetic correlation coefficient increases during the crisis, indicating that the hierarchical structure increases during this period. When the crisis hit the market, the companies behave synchronously and their correlations become stronger than the normal period.

010       Some Perspectives on Network Modeling in Therapeutic Target Prediction
021       Drug target identification is of significant commercial interest to pharmaceutical companies, and there is a vast amount of research done related to the topic of therapeutic target identification. 
020       Interdisciplinary research in this area involves both the biological network community and the graph algorithms community. Key steps of a typical therapeutic target identification problem include synthesizing or inferring the complex network of interactions relevant to the disease, connecting this network to the disease-specific behavior, and predicting which components are key mediators of the behavior. All of these steps involve graph theoretical or graph algorithmic aspects. In this perspective, we provide modelling and algorithmic perspectives for therapeutic target identification and highlight a number of algorithmic advances, which have gotten relatively little attention so far, with the hope of strengthening the ties between these two research communities.

010       Towards realistic artificial benchmark for community detection   algorithms evaluation
021       Assessing the partitioning performance of community detection algorithms is one of the most important issues in complex network analysis. 
020       Artificially generated networks are often used as benchmarks for this purpose. However, previous studies showed their level of realism have a significant effect on the algorithms performance. In this study, we adopt a thorough experimental approach to tackle this problem and investigate this effect. To assess the level of realism, we use consensual network topological properties. Based on the LFR method, the most realistic generative method to date, we propose two alternative random models to replace the Configuration Model originally used in this algorithm, in order to increase its realism. Experimental results show both modifications allow generating collections of community-structured artificial networks whose topological properties are closer to those encountered in real-world networks. Moreover, the results obtained with eleven popular community identification algorithms on these benchmarks show their performance decrease on more realistic networks.

010       A Testing Based Extraction Algorithm for Identifying Significant   Communities in Networks
021       A common and important problem arising in the study of networks is how to divide the vertices of a given network into one or more groups, called communities, in such a way that vertices of the same community are more interconnected than vertices belonging to different ones. 
020       We propose and investigate a testing based community detection procedure called Extraction of Statistically Significant Communities (ESSC). The ESSC procedure is based on p-values for the strength of connection between a single vertex and a set of vertices under a reference distribution derived from a conditional configuration network model. The procedure automatically selects both the number of communities in the network, and their size. Moreover, ESSC can handle overlapping communities and, unlike the majority of existing methods, identifies "background" vertices that do not belong to a well-defined community. The method has only one parameter, which controls the stringency of the hypothesis tests. We investigate the performance and potential use of ESSC, and compare it with a number of existing methods, through a validation study using four real network datasets. In addition, we carry out a simulation study to assess the effectiveness of ESSC in networks with various types of community structure including networks with overlapping communities and those with background vertices. These results suggest that ESSC is an effective exploratory tool for the discovery of relevent community structure in complex network systems.

010       Clustering and Community Detection in Directed Networks: A Survey
021       Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. 
020       In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed - in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges non symmetric. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of applications. Therefore, naturally there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed graphs - with clustering being the primary method and tool for community detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth review of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results, demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future research directions.

010       Cooperation in changing environments: Irreversibility in the transition   to cooperation in networks
021       In the framework of the evolutionary dynamics of the Prisoner's Dilemma game on complex networks, we investigate the possibility that the average level of cooperation shows hysteresis under quasi-static variations of a model parameter (the "temptation to defect"). 
020       Under the "discrete replicator" strategy updating rule, for both Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert graphs we observe cooperation hysteresis cycles provided one reaches tipping point values of the parameter; otherwise, perfect reversibility is obtained. The selective fixation of cooperation at certain nodes and its organization in cooperator clusters, that are surrounded by fluctuating strategists, allows the rationalization of the "lagging behind" behavior observed.

010       Controllability Metrics, Limitations and Algorithms for Complex Networks
021       This paper studies the problem of controlling complex networks, that is, the joint problem of selecting a set of control nodes and of designing a control input to steer a network to a target state. 
020       For this problem (i) we propose a metric to quantify the difficulty of the control problem as a function of the required control energy, (ii) we derive bounds based on the system dynamics (network topology and weights) to characterize the tradeoff between the control energy and the number of control nodes, and (iii) we propose an open-loop control strategy with performance guarantees. In our strategy we select control nodes by relying on network partitioning, and we design the control input by leveraging optimal and distributed control techniques. Our findings show several control limitations and properties. For instance, for Schur stable and symmetric networks: (i) if the number of control nodes is constant, then the control energy increases exponentially with the number of network nodes, (ii) if the number of control nodes is a fixed fraction of the network nodes, then certain networks can be controlled with constant energy independently of the network dimension, and (iii) clustered networks may be easier to control because, for sufficiently many control nodes, the control energy depends only on the controllability properties of the clusters and on their coupling strength. We validate our results with examples from power networks, social networks, and epidemics spreading.

010       Topological Structure of Urban Street Networks from the Perspective of   Degree Correlations
021       Many complex networks demonstrate a phenomenon of striking degree correlations, i.e., a node tends to link to other nodes with similar (or dissimilar) degrees. 
020       From the perspective of degree correlations, this paper attempts to characterize topological structures of urban street networks. We adopted six urban street networks (three European and three North American), and converted them into network topologies in which nodes and edges respectively represent individual streets and street intersections, and compared the network topologies to three reference network topologies (biological, technological, and social). The urban street network topologies (with the exception of Manhattan) showed a consistent pattern that distinctly differs from the three reference networks. The topologies of urban street networks lack striking degree correlations in general. Through reshuffling the network topologies towards for example maximum or minimum degree correlations while retaining the initial degree distributions, we found that all the surrogate topologies of the urban street networks, as well as the reference ones, tended to deviate from small world properties. This implies that the initial degree correlations do not have any positive or negative effect on the networks' performance or functions. <br />Keywords: Scale free, small world, rewiring, rich club effect, reshuffle, and complex networks

010       The stability of a graph partition: A dynamics-based framework for   community detection
021       Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the analysis of complex networks, facilitated by the availability of relational data and the increasingly powerful computational resources that can be employed for their analysis. 
020       Naturally, the study of real-world systems leads to highly complex networks and a current challenge is to extract intelligible, simplified descriptions from the network in terms of relevant subgraphs, which can provide insight into the structure and function of the overall system. <br />Sparked by seminal work by Newman and Girvan, an interesting line of research has been devoted to investigating modular community structure in networks, revitalising the classic problem of graph partitioning. <br />However, modular or community structure in networks has notoriously evaded rigorous definition. The most accepted notion of community is perhaps that of a group of elements which exhibit a stronger level of interaction within themselves than with the elements outside the community. This concept has resulted in a plethora of computational methods and heuristics for community detection. Nevertheless a firm theoretical understanding of most of these methods, in terms of how they operate and what they are supposed to detect, is still lacking to date. <br />Here, we will develop a dynamical perspective towards community detection enabling us to define a measure named the stability of a graph partition. It will be shown that a number of previously ad-hoc defined heuristics for community detection can be seen as particular cases of our method providing us with a dynamic reinterpretation of those measures. Our dynamics-based approach thus serves as a unifying framework to gain a deeper understanding of different aspects and problems associated with community detection and allows us to propose new dynamically-inspired criteria for community structure.

010       Social distancing strategies against disease spreading
021       The recurrent infectious diseases and their increasing impact on the society has promoted the study of strategies to slow down the epidemic spreading. 
020       In this review we outline the applications of percolation theory to describe strategies against epidemic spreading on complex networks. We give a general outlook of the relation between link percolation and the susceptible-infected-recovered model, and introduce the node void percolation process to describe the dilution of the network composed by healthy individual, $i.e$, the network that sustain the functionality of a society. Then, we survey two strategies: the quenched disorder strategy where an heterogeneous distribution of contact intensities is induced in society, and the intermittent social distancing strategy where health individuals are persuaded to avoid contact with their neighbors for intermittent periods of time. Using percolation tools, we show that both strategies may halt the epidemic spreading. Finally, we discuss the role of the transmissibility, $i.e$, the effective probability to transmit a disease, on the performance of the strategies to slow down the epidemic spreading.

010       Structural Changes in Data Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks
021       Wireless sensor networks are an important technology for making distributed autonomous measures in hostile or inaccessible environments. 
020       Among the challenges they pose, the way data travel among them is a relevant issue since their structure is quite dynamic. The operational topology of such devices can often be described by complex networks. In this work, we assess the variation of measures commonly employed in the complex networks literature applied to wireless sensor networks. Four data communication strategies were considered: geometric, random, small-world, and scale-free models, along with the shortest path length measure. The sensitivity of this measure was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: insertion and removal of nodes in the geometric strategy; and insertion, removal and rewiring of links in the other models. The assessment was performed using the normalized Kullback-Leibler divergence and Hellinger distance quantifiers, both deriving from the Information Theory framework. The results reveal that the shortest path length is sensitive to perturbations.

010       Models of on-line social networks
021       We present a deterministic model for on-line social networks (OSNs) based on transitivity and local knowledge in social interactions. 
020       In the Iterated Local Transitivity (ILT) model, at each time-step and for every existing node $x$, a new node appears which joins to the closed neighbour set of $x.$ The ILT model provably satisfies a number of both local and global properties that were observed in OSNs and other real-world complex networks, such as a densification power law, decreasing average distance, and higher clustering than in random graphs with the same average degree. Experimental studies of social networks demonstrate poor expansion properties as a consequence of the existence of communities with low number of inter-community edges. Bounds on the spectral gap for both the adjacency and normalized Laplacian matrices are proved for graphs arising from the ILT model, indicating such bad expansion properties. The cop and domination number are shown to remain the same as the graph from the initial time-step $G_0$, and the automorphism group of $G_0$ is a subgroup of the automorphism group of graphs generated at all later time-steps. A randomized version of the ILT model is presented, which exhibits a tuneable densification power law exponent, and maintains several properties of the deterministic model.

010       Identification of hybrid node and link communities in complex networks
021       Identification of communities in complex networks has become an effective means to analysis of complex systems. 
020       It has broad applications in diverse areas such as social science, engineering, biology and medicine. Finding communities of nodes and finding communities of links are two popular schemes for network structure analysis. These schemes, however, have inherent drawbacks and are often inadequate to properly capture complex organizational structures in real networks. We introduce a new scheme and effective approach for identifying complex network structures using a mixture of node and link communities, called hybrid node-link communities. A central piece of our approach is a probabilistic model that accommodates node, link and hybrid node-link communities. Our extensive experiments on various real-world networks, including a large protein-protein interaction network and a large semantic association network of commonly used words, illustrated that the scheme for hybrid communities is superior in revealing network characteristics. Moreover, the new approach outperformed the existing methods for finding node or link communities separately.

010       A General Optimization Technique for High Quality Community Detection in   Complex Networks
021       Recent years have witnessed the development of a large body of algorithms for community detection in complex networks. 
020       Most of them are based upon the optimization of objective functions, among which modularity is the most common, though a number of alternatives have been suggested in the scientific literature. We present here an effective general search strategy for the optimization of various objective functions for community detection purposes. When applied to modularity, on both real-world and synthetic networks, our search strategy substantially outperforms the best existing algorithms in terms of final scores of the objective function; for description length, its performance is on par with the original Infomap algorithm. The execution time of our algorithm is on par with non-greedy alternatives present in literature, and networks of up to 10,000 nodes can be analyzed in time spans ranging from minutes to a few hours on average workstations, making our approach readily applicable to tasks which require the quality of partitioning to be as high as possible, and are not limited by strict time constraints. Finally, based on the most effective of the available optimization techniques, we compare the performance of modularity and code length as objective functions, in terms of the quality of the partitions one can achieve by optimizing them. To this end, we evaluated the ability of each objective function to reconstruct the underlying structure of a large set of synthetic and real-world networks.

010       Epidemic Spreading on Weighted Complex Networks
021       Nowadays, the emergence of online services provides various multi-relation information to support the comprehensive understanding of the epidemic spreading process. 
020       In this Letter, we consider the edge weights to represent such multi-role relations. In addition, we perform detailed analysis of two representative metrics, outbreak threshold and epidemic prevalence, on SIS and SIR models. Both theoretical and simulation results find good agreements with each other. Furthermore, experiments show that, on fully mixed networks, the weight distribution on edges would not affect the epidemic results once the average weight of whole network is fixed. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of epidemic spreading on multi-relation and weighted networks.

010       Climate Dynamics: A Network-Based Approach for the Analysis of Global   Precipitation
021       Precipitation is one of the most important meteorological variables for defining the climate dynamics, but the spatial patterns of precipitation have not been fully investigated yet. 
020       The complex network theory, which provides a robust tool to investigate the statistical interdependence of many interacting elements, is used here to analyze the spatial dynamics of annual precipitation over seventy years (1941-2010). <br />The precipitation network reveals significant spatial variability with barely connected regions, as Eastern China and Japan, and highly connected regions, such as the African Sahel, Eastern Australia and, to a lesser extent, Northern Europe. Sahel and Eastern Australia are remarkably dry regions, where low amounts of rainfall are uniformly distributed on continental scales and small-scale extreme events are rare. As a consequence, the precipitation gradient is low, making these regions well connected on a large spatial scale. On the contrary, the Asiatic South-East is often reached by extreme events such as monsoons, tropical cyclones and heat waves, which can all contribute to reduce the correlation to the short-range scale only. <br />Some patterns emerging between mid-latitude and tropical regions suggest a possible impact of the propagation of planetary waves on precipitation at a global scale. Other links can be qualitatively associated to the atmospheric and oceanic circulation. To analyze the sensitivity of the network to the physical closeness of the nodes, short-term connections are broken. The African Sahel, Eastern Australia and Northern Europe regions again appear as the supernodes of the network, confirming furthermore their long-range connection structure. Almost all North-American and Asian nodes vanish, revealing that extreme events can enhance high precipitation gradients, leading to a systematic absence of long-range patterns.

010       The Fractal Dimension of SAT Formulas
021       Modern SAT solvers have experienced a remarkable progress on solving industrial instances. 
020       Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental testing process. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of these formulas in terms of complex networks, with the long-term aim of explaining the success of these SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them. <br />We study the fractal dimension of SAT formulas, and show that most industrial families of formulas are self-similar, with a small fractal dimension. We also show that this dimension is not affected by the addition of learnt clauses. We explore how the dimension of a formula, together with other graph properties can be used to characterize SAT instances. Finally, we give empirical evidence that these graph properties can be used in state-of-the-art portfolios.

010       A network approach to analyzing highly recombinant malaria parasite   genes
021       The var genes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum present a challenge to population geneticists due to their extreme diversity, which is generated by high rates of recombination. 
020       These genes encode a primary antigen protein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are characterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional phylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary relationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions (HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a node and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant length. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have a uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce network communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We validate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers populations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy Binding Like-{\alpha} (DBL{\alpha}) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs whose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBL{\alpha} classifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational constraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These findings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent evolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite to retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our approach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary constraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more generally to any highly recombinant sequences.

010       Ashes 2013 - A network theory analysis of Cricket strategies
021       We demonstrate in this paper the use of tools of complex network theory to describe the strategy of Australia and England in the recently concluded Ashes 2013 Test series. 
020       Using partnership data made available by cricinfo during the Ashes 2013 Test series, we generate batting partnership network (BPN) for each team, in which nodes correspond to batsmen and links represent runs scored in partnerships between batsmen. The resulting network display a visual summary of the pattern of run-scoring by each team, which helps us in identifying potential weakness in a batting order. We use different centrality scores to quantify the performance, relative importance and effect of removing a player from the team. We observe that England is an extremely well connected team, in which lower order batsmen consistently contributed significantly to the team score. Contrary to this Australia showed dependence on their top order batsmen.

010       Approximate solution to the stochastic Kuramoto model
021       We study Kuramoto phase oscillators with temporal fluctuations in the frequencies. 
020       The infinite-dimensional system can be reduced in a Gaussian approximation to two first-order differential equations. This yields a solution for the \emph{time-dependent} order parameter, which characterizes the synchronization between the oscillators. The known critical coupling strength is exactly recovered by the Gaussian theory. Extensive numerical experiments further show that the analytical results are very accurate below and sufficiently above the critical value. We obtain the asymptotic order parameter \emph{in closed form}, which suggests a tighter upper bound for the corresponding scaling. As a last point, we elaborate the Gaussian approximation in complex networks with distributed degrees.

010       Measuring the dimension of partially embedded networks
021       Scaling phenomena have been intensively studied during the past decade in the context of complex networks. 
020       As part of these works, recently novel methods have appeared to measure the dimension of abstract and spatially embedded networks. In this paper we propose a new dimension measurement method for networks, which does not require global knowledge on the embedding of the nodes, instead it exploits link-wise information (link lengths, link delays or other physical quantities). Our method can be regarded as a generalization of the spectral dimension, that grasps the network's large-scale structure through local observations made by a random walker while traversing the links. We apply the presented method to synthetic and real-world networks, including road maps, the Internet infrastructure and the Gowalla geosocial network. We analyze the theoretically and empirically designated case when the length distribution of the links has the form P(r) ~ 1/r. We show that while previous dimension concepts are not applicable in this case, the new dimension measure still exhibits scaling with two distinct scaling regimes. Our observations suggest that the link length distribution is not sufficient in itself to entirely control the dimensionality of complex networks, and we show that the proposed measure provides information that complements other known measures.

010       Efficient community detection via sampling processes in complex networks
021       The identification of community structures is essential for characterizing real networks formed by a mesoscopic level of organization where clusters contain nodes with a high internal degree of connectivity. 
020       Many methods have been developed to unveil community structures, but only a few studies have probed their suitability in incomplete networks. Here we assess the accuracy of community detection techniques in incomplete networks generated in sampling processes. We show that the walktrap and fast greedy algorithms are highly accurate for detecting the modular structure of incomplete complex networks even if many of their nodes are removed. Furthermore, we implemented an approach that improved the time performance of the walktrap and fast greedy algorithms, while retaining the accuracy rate in identifying the community membership of nodes. Taken together our results show that this new approach can be applied to speed up virtually any community detection method, especially if the network under analysis is tightly connected.

We introduce a Hard-core Random Network model that generates maximally random networks with arbitrary degree distribution and arbitrary k-core structure. We then solve exactly the bond percolation problem on the HRN model and produce fast and precise analytical estimates for the corresponding real networks. Extensive comparison with selected databases reveals that our approach performs better than existing models, while requiring less input information.

010       Enhanced Flow in Small-World Networks
021       The small-world property is known to have a profound effect on the navigation efficiency of complex networks [J. 
020       M. Kleinberg, Nature 406, 845 (2000)]. Accordingly, the proper addition of shortcuts to a regular substrate can lead to the formation of a highly efficient structure for information propagation. Here we show that enhanced flow properties can also be observed in these complex topologies. Precisely, our model is a network built from an underlying regular lattice over which long-range connections are randomly added according to the probability, $P_{ij}\sim r_{ij}^{-\alpha}$, where $r_{ij}$ is the Manhattan distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, and the exponent $\alpha$ is a controlling parameter. The mean two-point global conductance of the system is computed by considering that each link has a local conductance given by $g_{ij}\propto r_{ij}^{-\delta}$, where $\delta$ determines the extent of the geographical limitations (costs) on the long-range connections. Our results show that the best flow conditions are obtained for $\delta=0$ with $\alpha=0$, while for $\delta \gg 1$ the overall conductance always increases with $\alpha$. For $\delta\approx 1$, $\alpha=d$ becomes the optimal exponent, where $d$ is the topological dimension of the substrate. Interestingly, this exponent is identical to the one obtained for optimal navigation in small-world networks using decentralized algorithms.

Under a proper definition of the thermodynamic limit (with the average degree of the agents kept fixed while increasing the network size), the model is found to display the empirical scaling discovered by Fortunato and Castellano (Phys Rev Lett 99(13):138701, 2007), while the vote distribution resembles roughly that observed in Brazilian elections.

020       In this paper, we consider what is called the global clustering coefficient of random graphs on the hyperbolic plane. This model of random graphs was introduced recently by Krioukov et al. as a mathematical model of complex networks, which naturally embeds the (tree-like) hierarchical structure of a complex network into a hyperbolic space. We give a rigorous analysis of clustering and characterize the global clustering coefficient in terms of the parameters of the model. We show that the global clustering coefficient can be tuned by such parameters and we give an explicit formula for this function.

010       Exactly scale-free scale-free networks
021       There is mounting evidence of the apparent ubiquity of scale-free networks among complex systems. 
020       Many natural and physical systems exhibit patterns of interconnection that conform, approximately, to the structure expected of a scale-free network. We propose an efficient algorithm to generate representative samples from the space of all networks defined by a particular (scale-free) degree distribution. Using this algorithm we are able to systematically explore that space with some surprising results: in particular, we find that preferential attachment growth models do not yield typical realizations and that there is a certain latent structure among such networks --- which we loosely term "hub-centric". We provide a method to generate or remove this latent hub-centric bias --- thereby demonstrating exactly which features of preferential attachment networks are atypical of the broader class of scale free networks. Based on these results we are also able to statistically determine whether experimentally observed networks are really typical realizations of a given degree distribution (scale-free degree being the example which we explore). In so doing we propose a surrogate generation method for complex networks, exactly analogous the the widely used surrogate tests of nonlinear time series analysis.

010       Electrical Structure-Based PMU Placement in Electric Power Systems
021       Recent work on complex networks compared the topological and electrical structures of the power grid, taking into account the underlying physical laws that govern the electrical connectivity between various components in the network. 
020       A distance metric, namely, resistance distance was introduced to provide a more comprehensive description of interconnections in power systems compared with the topological structure, which is based only on geographic connections between network components. Motivated by these studies, in this paper we revisit the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem by deriving the connectivity matrix of the network using resistance distances between buses in the grid, and use it in the integer program formulations for several standard IEEE bus systems. The main result of this paper is rather discouraging: more number of PMUs are required, compared with those obtained using the topological structure, to meet the desired objective of complete network observability without zero injection measurements. However, in light of recent advances in the electrical structure of the grid, our study provides a more realistic perspective of PMU placement in power systems. By further exploring the connectivity matrix derived using the electrical structure, we devise a procedure to solve the placement problem without resorting to linear programming.

010       Quantitative modeling of degree-degree correlation in complex networks
021       This paper presents an approach to the modeling of degree-degree correlation in complex networks. 
020       Thus, a simple function, \Delta(k', k), describing specific degree-to- degree correlations is considered. The function is well suited to graphically depict assortative and disassortative variations within networks. To quantify degree correlation variations, the joint probability distribution between nodes with arbitrary degrees, P(k', k), is used. Introduction of the end-degree probability function as a basic variable allows using group theory to derive mathematical models for P(k', k). In this form, an expression, representing a family of seven models, is constructed with the needed normalization conditions. Applied to \Delta(k', k), this expression predicts a nonuniform distribution of degree correlation in networks, organized in two assortative and two disassortative zones. This structure is actually observed in a set of four modeled, technological, social, and biological networks. A regression study performed on 15 actual networks shows that the model describes quantitatively degree-degree correlation variations.

010       Complex Network Structure of Flocks in the Standard Vicsek Model
021       In flocking models, the collective motion of self-driven individuals leads to the formation of complex spatiotemporal patterns. 
020       The Standard Vicsek Model (SVM) considers individuals that tend to adopt the direction of movement of their neighbors under the influence of noise. By performing an extensive complex network characterization of the structure of SVM flocks, we show that flocks are highly clustered, assortative, and non-hierarchical networks with short-tailed degree distributions. Moreover, we also find that the SVM dynamics leads to the formation of complex structures with an effective dimension higher than that of the space where the actual displacements take place. Furthermore, we show that these structures are capable of sustaining mean-field-like orientationally ordered states when the displacements are suppressed, thus suggesting a linkage between the onset of order and the enhanced dimensionality of SVM flocks.

010       The Cost of an Epidemic over a Complex Network: A Random Matrix Approach
021       In this paper we quantify the total economic impact of an epidemic over a complex network using tools from random matrix theory. 
020       Incorporating the direct and indirect costs of infection, we calculate the disease cost in the large graph limit for an SIS (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) infection process. We also give an upper bound on this cost for arbitrary finite graphs and illustrate both calculated costs using extensive simulations on random and real-world networks. We extend these calculations by considering the total social cost of an epidemic, accounting for both the immunization and disease costs for various immunization strategies and determining the optimal immunization. Our work focuses on the transient behavior of the epidemic, in contrast to previous research, which typically focuses on determining the steady-state system equilibrium.

010       Statistical Mechanics of Multi-Edge Networks
021       Statistical properties of binary complex networks are well understood and recently many attempts have been made to extend this knowledge to weighted ones. 
020       There is, however, a subtle difference between networks where weights are continuos variables and those where they account for discrete, distinguishable events, which we call multi-edge networks. In this work we face this problem introducing multi-edge networks as graphs where multiple (distinguishable) connections between nodes are considered. We develop a statistical mechanics framework where it is possible to get information about the most relevant observables given a large spectrum of linear and nonlinear constraints including those depending both on the number of multi-edges per link and their binary projection. The latter case is particularly interesting as we show that binary projections can be understood from multi-edge processes. The implications of these results are important as many real agent based problems mapped onto graphs require of this treatment for a proper characterization of its collective behavior.

010       Robustness of Network Measures to Link Errors
021       In various applications involving complex networks, network measures are employed to assess the relative importance of network nodes. 
020       However, the robustness of such measures in the presence of link inaccuracies has not been well characterized. Here we present two simple stochastic models of false and missing links and study the effect of link errors on three commonly used node centrality measures: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and dynamical importance. We perform numerical simulations to assess robustness of these three centrality measures. We also develop an analytical theory, which we compare with our simulations, obtaining very good agreement.

It is based on an approach developed to model complex networks, making it appropriate for use on large, complicated circuits. It is unique in that it is not an analytic method. It is based on experiment, yet the approach produces the same circuit equations obtained by more traditional means.

010       Characterizing and modeling an electoral campaign in the context of   Twitter: 2011 Spanish Presidential Election as a case study
021       Transmitting messages in the most efficient way as possible has always been one of politicians main concerns during electoral processes. 
020       Due to the rapidly growing number of users, online social networks have become ideal platforms for politicians to interact with their potential voters. Exploiting the available potential of these tools to maximize their influence over voters is one of politicians actual challenges. To step in this direction, we have analyzed the user activity in the online social network Twitter, during the 2011 Spanish Presidential electoral process, and found that such activity is correlated with the election results. We introduce a new measure to study political support in Twitter, which we call the Relative Support. We have also characterized user behavior by analyzing the structural and dynamical patterns of the complex networks emergent from the mention and retweet networks. Our results suggest that the collective attention is driven by a very small fraction of users. Furthermore we have analyzed the interactions taking place among politicians, observing a lack of debate. Finally we develop a network growth model to reproduce the interactions taking place among politicians.

010       Co-evolutionary dynamics in social networks: A case study of Twitter
021       Complex networks often exhibit co-evolutionary dynamics, meaning that the network topology and the state of nodes or links are coupled, affecting each other in overlapping time scales. 
020       We focus on the co-evolutionary dynamics of online social networks, and on Twitter in particular. Monitoring the activity of thousands of Twitter users in real-time, and tracking their followers and tweets/retweets, we propose a method to infer new retweet-driven follower relations. The formation of such relations is much more likely than the exogenous creation of new followers in the absence of any retweets. We identify the most significant factors (reciprocity and the number of retweets that a potential new follower receives) and propose a simple probabilistic model of this effect. We also discuss the implications of such co-evolutionary dynamics on the topology and function of a social network.

010       Kinetics of node splitting in evolving complex networks
021       We introduce a collection of complex networks generated by a combination of preferential attachment and a previously unexamined process of "splitting" nodes of degree $k$ into $k$ nodes of degree 1. 
020       Four networks are considered, each evolves at each time step by either preferential attachment, with probability $p$, or splitting with probability $1-p$. Two methods of attachment are considered; first, attachment of an edge between a newly created node and existing node in the network, and secondly by attachment of an edge between two existing nodes. Splitting is also considered in two separate ways; first by selecting each node with equal probability and secondly, selecting the node with probability proportional to its degree. Exact solutions for the degree distributions are found and scale-free structure is exhibited in those networks where the candidates for splitting are chosen with uniform probability, those that are chosen preferentially are distributed with a power law with exponential cut-off.

010       Symmetries, Cluster Synchronization, and Isolated Desynchronization in   Complex Networks
021       Synchronization is of central importance in power distribution, telecommunication, neuronal, and biological networks. 
020       Many networks are observed to produce patterns of synchronized clusters, but it has been difficult to predict these clusters or understand the conditions under which they form, except for in the simplest of networks. In this article, we shed light on the intimate connection between network symmetry and cluster synchronization. We introduce general techniques that use network symmetries to reveal the patterns of synchronized clusters and determine the conditions under which they persist. The connection between symmetry and cluster synchronization is experimentally explored using an electro-optic network. We experimentally observe and theoretically predict a surprising phenomenon in which some clusters lose synchrony while leaving others synchronized. The results could guide the design of new power grid systems or lead to new understanding of the dynamical behavior of networks ranging from neural to social.

010       Dynamic Structural Equation Models for Social Network Topology Inference
021       Many real-world processes evolve in cascades over complex networks, whose topologies are often unobservable and change over time. 
020       However, the so-termed adoption times when blogs mention popular news items, individuals in a community catch an infectious disease, or consumers adopt a trendy electronics product are typically known, and are implicitly dependent on the underlying network. To infer the network topology, a \textit{dynamic} structural equation model is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times and the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and leveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights are estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient iterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced computational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while accounting for external influences in the adoption times. Key events in the recent succession of political leadership in North Korea, explain connectivity changes observed in the associated network inferred from global cascades of online media.

010       Multifractals of central place systems: models, dimension spectrums, and   empirical analysis
021       Central place systems have been demonstrated to possess self-similar patterns in both the theoretical and empirical perspectives. 
020       A central place fractal can be treated as a monofractal with a single scaling process. However, in the real world, a system of human settlements is a complex network with multi-scaling processes. The simple fractal central place models are not enough to interpret the spatial patterns and evolutive processes of urban systems. It is necessary to construct multi-scaling fractal models of urban places. Based on the postulate of intermittent space filling, two typical multifractal models of central places are proposed in this paper. One model is put forward to reflect the process of spatial convergence (aggregation), and the generalized correlation dimension varies from 0.7306 to 1.3181; the other model is presented to describe the process of spatial divergence (diffusion), the generalized correlation dimension ranges from 1.6523 to 1.7118. As a case study, an analogy is drawn between the theoretical models and a system of cities and towns of Central Plains, China. A finding is that urban systems take on multifractal form, and can be modeled with multi-scaling fractals. This is a preliminary attempt to develop the theory of fractal central places, and the results are helpful for understanding the similarities and differences between the geographical process of spatial aggregation and that of spatial diffusion.

010       The failure tolerance of mechatronic software systems to random and   targeted attacks
021       This paper describes a complex networks approach to study the failure tolerance of mechatronic software systems under various types of hardware and/or software failures. 
020       We produce synthetic system architectures based on evidence of modular and hierarchical modular product architectures and known motifs for the interconnection of physical components to software. The system architectures are then subject to various forms of attack. The attacks simulate failure of critical hardware or software. Four types of attack are investigated: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and random attack. Failure tolerance of the system is measured by a 'robustness coefficient', a topological 'size' metric of the connectedness of the attacked network. We find that the betweenness centrality attack results in the most significant reduction in the robustness coefficient, confirming betweenness centrality, rather than the number of connections (i.e. degree), as the most conservative metric of component importance. A counter-intuitive finding is that "designed" system architectures, including a bus, ring, and star architecture, are not significantly more failure-tolerant than interconnections with no prescribed architecture, that is, a random architecture. Our research provides a data-driven approach to engineer the architecture of mechatronic software systems for failure tolerance.

010       Impact of order three cycles in complex network spectra
021       The asymptotic behaviour of dynamical processes in networks can be expressed as a function of spectral properties of the Adjacency and Laplacian matrices. 
020       Although many theoretical results are known for the spectra of traditional configuration models, networks generated through these models fail to describe many topological features of real-world networks, in particular non-null values for the clustering coefficient. Here we study the effects of cycles or order three (triangles) in network spectra. By using recent advances in random matrix theory, we determine the spectrum distribution of the network Adjacency matrix as a function of the average number of triangles attached to each node for networks without modular structure and degree-degree correlations. Furthermore we show that cycles of order three have a weak influence on the Laplacian eigenvalues, fact that explains the recent controversy on the dynamics of clustered networks. Our findings can shed light in the study of how particular kinds of subgraphs influence network dynamics.

010       Overlapping community detection in signed networks
021       Complex networks considering both positive and negative links have gained considerable attention during the past several years. 
020       Community detection is one of the main challenges for complex network analysis. Most of the existing algorithms for community detection in a signed network aim at providing a hard-partition of the network where any node should belong to a community or not. However, they cannot detect overlapping communities where a node is allowed to belong to multiple communities. The overlapping communities widely exist in many real world networks. In this paper, we propose a signed probabilistic mixture (SPM) model for overlapping community detection in signed networks. Compared with the existing models, the advantages of our methodology are (i) providing soft-partition solutions for signed networks; (ii) providing soft-memberships of nodes. Experiments on a number of signed networks show that our SPM model: (i) can identify assortative structures or disassortative structures as the same as other state-of-the-art models; (ii) can detect overlapping communities; (iii) outperform other state-of-the-art models at shedding light on the community detection in synthetic signed networks.

010       Opinion Dynamic with agents immigration
021       We propose a strategy for achieving maximum cooperation in evolutionary games on complex networks. 
020       Each individual is assigned a weight that is proportional to the power of its degree, where the exponent alpha is an adjustable parameter that controls the level of diversity among individuals in the network. During the evolution, every individual chooses one of its neighbors as a reference with a probability proportional to the weight of the neighbor, and updates its strategy depending on their payoff difference. It is found that there exists an optimal value of alpha, for which the level of cooperation reaches maximum. This phenomenon indicates that, although high-degree individuals play a prominent role in maintaining the cooperation, too strong influences from the hubs may counterintuitively inhibit the diffusion of cooperation. We provide a physical theory, aided by numerical computations, to explain the emergence of the optimal cooperation. Other pertinent quantities such as the payoff, the cooperator density as a function of the degree, and the payoff distribution, are also investigated. Our results suggest that, in order to achieve strong cooperation on a complex network, individuals should learn more frequently from neighbors with higher degrees, but only to certain extent.

010       Complexity of Word Collocation Networks: A Preliminary Structural   Analysis
021       In this paper, we explore complex network properties of word collocation networks (Ferret, 2002) from four different genres. 
020       Each document of a particular genre was converted into a network of words with word collocations as edges. We analyzed graphically and statistically how the global properties of these networks varied across different genres, and among different network types within the same genre. Our results indicate that the distributions of network properties are visually similar but statistically apart across different genres, and interesting variations emerge when we consider different network types within a single genre. We further investigate how the global properties change as we add more and more collocation edges to the graph of one particular genre, and observe that except for the number of vertices and the size of the largest connected component, network properties change in phases, via jumps and drops.

010       Disentangling different types of El Ni\~no episodes by evolving climate   network analysis
021       Complex network theory provides a powerful toolbox for studying the structure of statistical interrelationships between multiple time series in various scientific disciplines. 
020       In this work, we apply the recently proposed climate network approach for characterizing the evolving correlation structure of the Earth's climate system based on reanalysis data of surface air temperatures. We provide a detailed study on the temporal variability of several global climate network characteristics. Based on a simple conceptual view on red climate networks (i.e., networks with a comparably low number of edges), we give a thorough interpretation of our evolving climate network characteristics, which allows a functional discrimination between recently recognized different types of El Ni\~no episodes. Our analysis provides deep insights into the Earth's climate system, particularly its global response to strong volcanic eruptions and large-scale impacts of different phases of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

010       Architecture of the Florida Power Grid as a Complex Network
021       We study the Florida high-voltage power grid as a technological network embedded in space. 
020       Measurements of geographical lengths of transmission lines, the mixing of generators and loads, the weighted clustering coefficient, as well as the organization of edge conductance weights show a complex architecture quite different from random-graph models usually considered. In particular, we introduce a parametrized mixing matrix to characterize the mixing pattern of generators and loads in the Florida Grid, which is intermediate between the random mixing case and the semi-bipartite case where generator-generator transmission lines are forbidden. Our observations motivate an investigation of optimization (design) principles leading to the structural organization of power grids. We thus propose two network optimization models for the Florida Grid as a case study. Our results show that the Florida Grid is optimized not only by reducing the construction cost (measured by the total length of power lines), but also through reducing the total pairwise edge resistance in the grid, which increases the robustness of power transmission between generators and loads against random line failures. We then embed our models in spatial areas of different aspect ratios and study how this geometric factor affects the network structure, as well as the box-counting fractal dimension of the grids generated by our models.

010       Exact Controllability of Complex Networks
021       Controlling complex networks is of paramount importance in science and engineering. 
020       Despite the recent development of structural-controllability theory, we continue to lack a framework to control undirected complex networks, especially given link weights. Here we introduce an exact-controllability paradigm based on the maximum multiplicity to identify the minimum set of driver nodes required to achieve full control of networks with arbitrary structures and link-weight distributions. The framework reproduces the structural controllability of directed networks characterized by structural matrices. We explore the controllability of a large number of real and model networks, finding that dense networks with identical weights are difficult to be controlled. An efficient and accurate tool is offered to assess the controllability of large sparse and dense networks. The exact-controllability framework enables a comprehensive understanding of the impact of network properties on controllability, a fundamental problem towards our ultimate control of complex systems.

010       Cosmological networks
021       Networks often represent systems that do not have a long history of studies in traditional fields of physics, albeit there are some notable exceptions such as energy landscapes and quantum gravity. 
020       Here we consider networks that naturally arise in cosmology. Nodes in these networks are stationary observers uniformly distributed in an expanding open FLRW universe with any scale factor, and two observers are connected if one can causally influence the other. We show that these networks are growing Lorentz-invariant graphs with power-law distributions of node degrees. New links in these networks not only connect new nodes to existing ones, but also appear at a certain rate between existing nodes, as they do in many complex networks.

010       Quest-V: A Virtualized Multikernel for Safety-Critical Real-Time Systems
021       Modern processors are increasingly featuring multiple cores, as well as support for hardware virtualization. 
020       While these processors are common in desktop and server-class computing, they are less prevalent in embedded and real-time systems. However, smartphones and tablet PCs are starting to feature multicore processors with hardware virtualization. If the trend continues, it is possible that future real-time systems will feature more sophisticated processor architectures. Future automotive or avionics systems, for example, could replace complex networks of uniprocessors with consolidated services on a smaller number of multicore processors. Likewise, virtualization could be used to isolate services and increase the availability of a system even when failures occur. <br />This paper investigates whether advances in modern processor technologies offer new opportunities to rethink the design of real-time operating systems. We describe some of the design principles behind Quest-V, which is being used as an exploratory vehicle for real-time system design on multicore processors with hardware virtualization capabilities. While not all embedded systems should assume such features, a case can be made that more robust, safety-critical systems can be built to use hardware virtualization without incurring significant overheads.

010       Sparse Predictive Structure of Deconvolved Functional Brain Networks
021       The functional and structural representation of the brain as a complex network is marked by the fact that the comparison of noisy and intrinsically correlated high-dimensional structures between experimental conditions or groups shuns typical mass univariate methods. 
020       Furthermore most network estimation methods cannot distinguish between real and spurious correlation arising from the convolution due to nodes' interaction, which thus introduces additional noise in the data. We propose a machine learning pipeline aimed at identifying multivariate differences between brain networks associated to different experimental conditions. The pipeline (1) leverages the deconvolved individual contribution of each edge and (2) maps the task into a sparse classification problem in order to construct the associated "sparse deconvolved predictive network", i.e., a graph with the same nodes of those compared but whose edge weights are defined by their relevance for out of sample predictions in classification. We present an application of the proposed method by decoding the covert attention direction (left or right) based on the single-trial functional connectivity matrix extracted from high-frequency magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. Our results demonstrate how network deconvolution matched with sparse classification methods outperforms typical approaches for MEG decoding.

010       Community Detection in Quantum Complex Networks
021       Determining the community structure is a central topic in the study of complex networks, be it technological, social, biological or chemical, static or interacting systems. 
020       In this paper, we extend the concept of community detection from classical to quantum systems --- a crucial missing component of a theory of complex networks based on quantum mechanics. We demonstrate that certain quantum mechanical effects cannot be captured using current classical complex network tools, and thus we develop new tools. Our approaches are based on defining closeness measures between nodes, and then maximizing modularity with hierarchical clustering. Our closeness functions are based on quantum transport probability and state fidelity, two important quantities in quantum information theory. To illustrate the effectiveness our approach to detect community structure in quantum systems we provide many examples, including a naturally occurring light harvesting complex, LHCII. The prediction of our simplest algorithm, semi-classical in nature, mostly agrees with a supposed partitioning for the LHCII found in quantum chemistry literature, whereas our fully quantum algorithms uncover a new, consistent and appropriately quantum community structure. By merging concepts from quantum physics and complex network theory, our work provides a bidirectional bridge of relevant analysis tools to address networks in both disciplines.

021       We develop a biophysical model of neuro-sensory integration in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. 
020       Building on recent experimental findings of the neuron conductances and their resolved connectome, we posit the first full dynamic model of the neural voltage excitations that allows for a characterization of input stimuli to behavioral responses. Thus a clear connection between receptory cell inputs to downstream motor-responses is illustrated, showing that robust, low-dimensional bifurcation structures dominate neural pathways of activity. The underlying bifurcation structures discovered, i.e. an induced Hopf bifurcation, are critical in explaining behavioral responses such as swimming and crawling. More broadly, we demonstrate that complex dynamical networks can produce robust functionality from underlying low-dimensional bifurcations.

010       Anti-rumor dynamics and emergence of the timing threshold on complex   network
021       Anti-rumor dynamics is proposed on the basis of rumor dynamics and the characteristics of anti-rumor dynamics are explored by both mean-field equations and numerical simulations on complex network. 
020       The main metrics we study are the timing effect of combating rumor and the identification of influential nodes, which are what an efficient strategy against rumor may concern about. The results indicate that, there exists robust time dependence of anti-rumor dynamics and the timing threshold emerges as a consequence of launching the anti-rumor at deferent delay time after the beginning of rumor spreading. The timing threshold as a critical feature is further verified on a series of Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks (BA networks), where anti-rumor dynamics arises explicitly. The timing threshold is a network-dependent quantity and its value decreases as the average degree of the BA network increases until close to zero. Meanwhile, coreness also constitutes a better topological descriptor to identify hubs. Our results will hopefully be useful for the understanding of spreading behaviors of rumor and anti-rumor and suggest a possible avenue for further study of interplays of multiple pieces of information on complex network.

020       We develop a novel correspondence between the adjacencies in a general stochastic Kronecker graph and the action of a fixed Markov chain. Using this correspondence we are able to generalize the arguments of Horn and Radcliffe on the emergence of the giant component from the case where k = 2 to arbitrary k. We are also able to use this correspondence to completely analyze the connectivity of a general stochastic Kronecker graph.

020       We propose methods of analysing such directed acyclic graphs taking into account the constraints of causality and highlighting the causal structure. We illustrate our approach using citation networks formed from academic papers, patents, and US Supreme Court verdicts. We show how transitive reduction reveals fundamental differences in the citation practices of different areas, how it highlights particularly interesting work, and how it can correct for the effect that the age of a document has on its citation count. Finally, we transitively reduce null models of citation networks with similar degree distributions and show the difference in degree distributions after transitive reduction to illustrate the lack of causal structure in such models.

010       Duality between preferential attachment and static random networks on   hyperbolic spaces
021       There is a complex relation between the mechanism of preferential attachment, scale-free degree distributions and hyperbolicity in complex networks. 
020       In fact, both preferential attachment and hidden hyperbolic spaces often generate scale-free networks. We show that there is actually a duality between a class of growing spatial networks based on preferential attachment on the sphere and a class of static random networks on the hyperbolic plane. Both classes of networks have the same scale-free degree distribution as the Barabasi-Albert model. As a limit of this correspondence, the Barabasi-Albert model is equivalent to a static random network on an hyperbolic space with infinite curvature.

010       Topological-collaborative approach for disambiguating authors&#x27; names in   collaborative networks
021       Concepts and methods of complex networks have been employed to uncover patterns in a myriad of complex systems. 
020       Unfortunately, the relevance and significance of these patterns strongly depends on the reliability of the data sets. In the study of collaboration networks, for instance, unavoidable noise pervading author's collaboration datasets arises when authors share the same name. To address this problem, we derive a hybrid approach based on authors' collaboration patterns and on topological features of collaborative networks. Our results show that the combination of strategies, in most cases, performs better than the traditional approach which disregards topological features. We also show that the main factor for improving the discriminability of homonymous authors is the average distance between authors. Finally, we show that it is possible to predict the weighting associated to each strategy compounding the hybrid system by examining the discrimination obtained from the traditional analysis of collaboration patterns. Once the methodology devised here is generic, our approach is potentially useful to classify many other networked systems governed by complex interactions.

010       Heterogeneous Delays in Neural Networks
021       We investigate heterogeneous coupling delays in complex networks of excitable elements described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. 
020       The effects of discrete as well as of uni- and bimodal continuous distributions are studied with a focus on different topologies, i.e., regular, small-world, and random networks. In the case of two discrete delay times resonance effects play a major role: Depending on the ratio of the delay times, various characteristic spiking scenarios, such as coherent or asynchronous spiking, arise. For continuous delay distributions different dynamical patterns emerge depending on the width of the distribution. For small distribution widths, we find highly synchronized spiking, while for intermediate widths only spiking with low degree of synchrony persists, which is associated with traveling disruptions, partial amplitude death, or subnetwork synchronization, depending sensitively on the network topology. If the inhomogeneity of the coupling delays becomes too large, global amplitude death is induced.

010       Statistical validation of high-dimensional models of growing networks
021       The abundance of models of complex networks and the current insufficient validation standards make it difficult to judge which models are strongly supported by data and which are not. 
020       We focus here on likelihood maximization methods for models of growing networks with many parameters and compare their performance on artificial and real datasets. While high dimensionality of the parameter space harms the performance of direct likelihood maximization on artificial data, this can be improved by introducing a suitable penalization term. Likelihood maximization on real data shows that the presented approach is able to discriminate among available network models. To make large-scale datasets accessible to this kind of analysis, we propose a subset sampling technique and show that it yields substantial model evidence in a fraction of time necessary for the analysis of the complete data.

010       Betweenness Centrality -- Incremental and Faster
021       We consider the incremental computation of the betweenness centrality of all vertices in a large complex network modeled as a graph G = (V, E), directed or undirected, with positive real edge-weights. 
020       The current widely used algorithm to compute the betweenness centrality of all vertices in G is the Brandes algorithm that runs in O(mn + n^2 log n) time, where n = |V| and m = |E|. <br />We present an incremental algorithm that updates the betweenness centrality score of all vertices in G when a new edge is added to G, or the weight of an existing edge is reduced. Our incremental algorithm runs in O(m' n + n^2) time, where m' is the size of a certain subset of E*, the set of edges in G that lie on a shortest path. We achieve the same bound for the more general incremental update of a vertex v, where the edge update can be performed on any subset of edges incident to v. <br />Our incremental algorithm is the first algorithm that is asymptotically faster on sparse graphs than recomputing with the Brandes algorithm. Our algorithm is also likely to be much faster than the Brandes algorithm on dense graphs since m*, the size of E*, is often close to linear in n. <br />Our incremental algorithm is very simple and the only data structures it uses are arrays, lists, and stack. We give an efficient cache-oblivious implementation that incurs O(scan(n^2) + n sort(m')) cache misses, where scan and sort are well-known measures for efficient caching. We also give a static algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of all vertices that runs in time O(m* n + n^2 log n), which is faster than the Brandes algorithm on any graph with n log n = o(m) and m* = o(m).

010       The Infinite Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model
021       In Stochastic blockmodels, which are among the most prominent statistical models for cluster analysis of complex networks, clusters are defined as groups of nodes with statistically similar link probabilities within and between groups. 
020       A recent extension by Karrer and Newman incorporates a node degree correction to model degree heterogeneity within each group. Although this demonstrably leads to better performance on several networks it is not obvious whether modelling node degree is always appropriate or necessary. We formulate the degree corrected stochastic blockmodel as a non-parametric Bayesian model, incorporating a parameter to control the amount of degree correction which can then be inferred from data. Additionally, our formulation yields principled ways of inferring the number of groups as well as predicting missing links in the network which can be used to quantify the model's predictive performance. On synthetic data we demonstrate that including the degree correction yields better performance both on recovering the true group structure and predicting missing links when degree heterogeneity is present, whereas performance is on par for data with no degree heterogeneity within clusters. On seven real networks (with no ground truth group structure available) we show that predictive performance is about equal whether or not degree correction is included; however, for some networks significantly fewer clusters are discovered when correcting for degree indicating that the data can be more compactly explained by clusters of heterogenous degree nodes.

010       Authorship Attribution Using Word Network Features
021       In this paper, we explore a set of novel features for authorship attribution of documents. 
020       These features are derived from a word network representation of natural language text. As has been noted in previous studies, natural language tends to show complex network structure at word level, with low degrees of separation and scale-free (power law) degree distribution. There has also been work on authorship attribution that incorporates ideas from complex networks. The goal of our paper is to explore properties of these complex networks that are suitable as features for machine-learning-based authorship attribution of documents. We performed experiments on three different datasets, and obtained promising results.

010       A Fractal and Scale-free Model of Complex Networks with Hub Attraction   Behaviors
021       It is widely believed that fractality of complex networks origins from hub repulsion behaviors (anticorrelation or disassortativity), which means large degree nodes tend to connect with small degree nodes. 
020       This hypothesis was demonstrated by a dynamical growth model, which evolves as the inverse renormalization procedure proposed by Song et al. Now we find that the dynamical growth model is based on the assumption that all the cross-boxes links has the same probability e to link to the most connected nodes inside each box. Therefore, we modify the growth model by adopting the flexible probability e, which makes hubs have higher probability to connect with hubs than non-hubs. With this model, we find some fractal and scale-free networks have hub attraction behaviors (correlation or assortativity). The results are the counter-examples of former beliefs.

010       Distinguishing the effects of internal and forced atmospheric   variability in climate networks
021       The fact that the Earth climate is a highly complex dynamical system is well-known. 
020       In the last few decades a lot of effort has been focused on understanding how climate phenomena in one geographical region affects the climate of other regions. Complex networks are a powerful framework for identifying climate interdependencies. To further exploit the knowledge of the links uncovered via the network analysis (for, e.g., improvements in prediction), a good understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these links is required. Here we focus in understanding the role of atmospheric variability, and construct climate networks representing internal and forced variability. In the connectivity of these networks we assess the influence of two main indices, NINO3.4 and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), by calculating the networks from time-series where these indices were linearly removed. We find that the connectivity of the forced variability network is heavily affected by ``El Ni\~no'': removing the NINO3.4 index yields a general loss of connectivity; even teleconnections between regions far away from the equatorial Pacific ocean are lost, suggesting that these regions are not directly linked, but rather, are indirectly interconnected via ``El Ni\~no'', particularly on interannual time scales. On the contrary, in the internal variability network (independent of sea surface temperature forcing) we find that the links are significantly affected by NAO with a maximum in intra-annual time scales. While the strongest non-local links found are those forced by the ocean, we show that there are also strong teleconnections due to internal atmospheric variability.

010       The oral tolerance as a complex network phenomenon
021       The phenomenon of oral tolerance refers to a local and systemic state of tolerance, induced in the gut associated lymphoid tissues, after its exposure to innocuous antigens, such as food proteins. 
020       While recent findings shed light in the cellular and molecular basis of oral tolerance, the network of interactions between the components mediating oral tolerance has not been investigated yet. Our work brings a complex systems theory approach, aiming to identify the contribution of each element in an oral tolerance network. We also propose a model that allows dynamical plus topological quantifying which must encompass functional responses as the local host involved on the oral tolerance. To keep track of reality of our model, we test knockout (KO) of immunological components (i. e. silencing a vertex) and see how it diverges when the system is topologically health. The results from these simulated KO's are then compared to real molecular knock-outs. To infer from these processing we apply a new implementation of a random walk algorithm for directed graphs, which ultimately generate statistical quantities provided by the dynamical behaviour of the simulated KO's. It was observed that the a specifics KO caused the greatest impact on network standard flux. In a brief analysis, the results obtained correspond to biological data. Our model addresses both topological proprieties and dynamical relations. The construction of a qualitative dynamic model for oral tolerance could reflect empirical observations, through the standard flux results and relative error based on individual knockout.

010       A new information dimension of complex networks
021       The fractal and self-similarity properties are revealed in many real complex networks. 
020       However, the classical information dimension of complex networks is not practical for real complex networks. In this paper, a new information dimension to characterize the dimension of complex networks is proposed. The difference of information for each box in the box-covering algorithm of complex networks is considered by this measure. The proposed method is applied to calculate the fractal dimensions of some real networks. Our results show that the proposed method is efficient for fractal dimension of complex networks.

010       Distributed Computing on Complex Networks
021       This work considers the problem of finding analytical expressions for the expected values of dis- tributed computing performance metrics when the underlying communication network has a complex structure. 
020       Through active probing tests a real distributed computing environment is analysed. From the resulting network, ensembles of synthetic graphs with additional structure are used in Monte Carlo simulations to both validate analytical expressions and explore the performance metrics under different conditions. Computing paradigms with different hierarchical structures in computing ser- vices are gauged, fully decentralised (i.e., peer-to-peer) environments providing the best performance. Moreover, it is found that by implementing more intelligent computing services configurations (e.g., betweenness centrality based mappings) and task allocations strategies, significant improvements in the parallel efficiency can be achieved. We qualitatively reproduce results from previous works and provide closed-form solutions for the expected performance metrics linking topological, application structure and allocation parameters when job dependencies and a complex network structure are considered.

010       Temporal prediction of epidemic patterns in community networks
021       Most previous studies of epidemic dynamics on complex networks suppose that the disease will eventually stabilize at either a disease-free state or an endemic one. 
020       In reality, however, some epidemics always exhibit sporadic and recurrent behaviour in one region because of the invasion from an endemic population elsewhere. In this paper we address this issue and study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemiological model on a network consisting of two communities, where the disease is endemic in one community but alternates between outbreaks and extinctions in the other. We provide a detailed characterization of the temporal dynamics of epidemic patterns in the latter community. In particular, we investigate the time duration of both outbreak and extinction, and the time interval between two consecutive inter-community infections, as well as their frequency distributions. Based on the mean-field theory, we theoretically analyze these three timescales and their dependence on the average node degree of each community, the transmission parameters, and the number of intercommunity links, which are in good agreement with simulations, except when the probability of overlaps between successive outbreaks is too large. These findings aid us in better understanding the bursty nature of disease spreading in a local community, and thereby suggesting effective time-dependent control strategies.

010       ComReg: A Complex Network Approach to Prioritize Test Cases for   Regression Testing
021       Regression testing is a testing process that is performed to provide confidence that changes in a part of software do not affect other parts of the software. 
020       Execution of the all existing test cases is the best way to re-establish the confidence.However, regression testing is an expensive process; there might be insufficient resources (e.g., time, testers) to allow for the re-execution of all test cases. Regression test prioritization techniques attempt to re-order a regression test suite based on some criteria so that highest priority test cases are executed earlier. <br />This paper presents ComReg, a test case prioritization technique based on the dependency network of faults. We model a fault dependency network as a directed graph and identify leading faults to prioritize test cases for regression testing. We use a centrality aggregation technique which considers six network representative centrality metrics to identify leading faults in the fault dependency network. We also discuss the use of fault communities to select an arbitrary percentage of the test cases from a prioritized regression test suite. Finally, we present a case study which shows the use of the technique in a software development process.

010       Contour polygonal approximation using shortest path in networks
021       Contour polygonal approximation is a simplified representation of a contour by line segments, so that the main characteristics of the contour remain in a small number of line segments. 
020       This paper presents a novel method for polygonal approximation based on the Complex Networks theory. We convert each point of the contour into a vertex, so that we model a regular network. Then we transform this network into a Small-World Complex Network by applying some transformations over its edges. By analyzing of network properties, especially the geodesic path, we compute the polygonal approximation. The paper presents the main characteristics of the method, as well as its functionality. We evaluate the proposed method using benchmark contours, and compare its results with other polygonal approximation methods.

010       Anomalous Consistency in Mild Cognitive Impairment: a complex networks   approach
021       Increased variability in performance has been associated with the emergence of several neurological and psychiatric pathologies. 
020       However, whether and how consistency of neuronal activity may also be indicative of an underlying pathology is still poorly understood. Here we propose a novel method for evaluating consistency from non-invasive brain recordings. We evaluate the consistency of the cortical activity recorded with magnetoencephalography in a group of subjects diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a condition sometimes prodromal of dementia, during the execution of a memory task. We use metrics coming from nonlinear dynamics to evaluate the consistency of cortical regions. A representation known as (parenclitic networks) is constructed, where atypical features are endowed with a network structure, the topological properties of which can be studied at various scales. Pathological conditions correspond to strongly heterogeneous networks, whereas typical or normative conditions are characterized by sparsely connected networks with homogeneous nodes. The analysis of this kind of networks allows identifying the extent to which consistency is affecting the MCI group and the focal points where MCI is specially severe. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first attempt at evaluating the consistency of brain functional activity using complex networks theory.

010       Nucleation, condensation and lambda-transition on a real-life stock   market
021       We fill a void in merging empirical and phenomenological characterisation of the dynamical phase transitions in complex systems by identifying three of them on real-life financial markets. 
020       We extract and interpret the empirical, numerical, and semi-analytical evidences for the existence of these phase transitions, by considering the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE), as a typical example of a financial market of a medium size. Using the canonical object for the graph theory, i.e. the Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) network, we observe: (i) The initial phase transition from the equilibrium to non-equilibrium MST network in its nucleation phase, occurring at some critical time. Coalescence of edges on the FSE's transient leader is observed within the nucleation and is approximately characterized by the Lifsthiz-Slyozov growth exponent; (ii) The nucleation accelerates and transforms to the condensation process, in the second phase transition, forming a logarithmically diverging lambda-peak of short-range order parameters at the subsequent critical time - an analogon of such a transition in superfluidity; (iii) In the third phase transition, the peak logarithmically decreases over three quarters of the year, resulting in a few loosely connected sub-graphs. This peak is reminiscent of a non-equilibrium superstar-like superhub or a `dragon king' effect, abruptly accelerating the evolution of the leader company. All these phase transitions are caused by the few richest vertices, which drift towards the leader and provide the most of the edges increasing the leader's degree. Thus, we capture an amazing phenomenon, likely of a more universal character, where a peripheral vertex becomes the one which is over dominating the complex network during an exceptionally long period of time.

020       We observe a concave-like temporal evolution of characteristic path length and cluster coefficient indicative of a movement from a more random toward a more regular and then back toward a more random functional topology. Surprisingly, synchronizability was significantly decreased during the seizure state but increased already prior to seizure end. Our findings underline the high relevance of studying complex systems from the view point of complex networks, which may help to gain deeper insights into the complicated dynamics underlying epileptic seizures.

010       Strong ties promote the epidemic prevalence in   susceptible-infected-susceptible spreading dynamics
021       Understanding spreading dynamics will benefit society as a whole in better preventing and controlling diseases, as well as facilitating the socially responsible information while depressing destructive rumors. 
020       In network-based spreading dynamics, edges with different weights may play far different roles: a friend from afar usually brings novel stories, and an intimate relationship is highly risky for a flu epidemic. In this article, we propose a weighted susceptible-infected-susceptible model on complex networks, where the weight of an edge is defined by the topological proximity of the two associated nodes. Each infected individual is allowed to select limited number of neighbors to contact, and a tunable parameter is introduced to control the preference to contact through high-weight or low-weight edges. Experimental results on six real networks show that the epidemic prevalence can be largely promoted when strong ties are favored in the spreading process. By comparing with two statistical null models respectively with randomized topology and randomly redistributed weights, we show that the distribution pattern of weights, rather than the topology, mainly contributes to the experimental observations. Further analysis suggests that the weight-weight correlation strongly affects the results: high-weight edges are more significant in keeping high epidemic prevalence when the weight-weight correlation is present.

010       Communities, roles, and informational organigrams in directed networks:   the Twitter network of the UK riots
021       Directionality is a crucial ingredient in many complex networks, in which information, energy or influence are transmitted. 
020       We showcase a framework for flow-based analysis for directed networks through the study of a network of influential Twitter users during the 2011 riots in England. Our analysis extracts nuanced descriptions of the network in terms of a multiresolution structure of interest communities within which flows of information are contained and reinforced. Such communities identify groups according to location, profession, employer, and topic, and are largely undetected if edge directionality is ignored. The flow structure also allows us to generate an interest distance, affording a personalised view of the network from any given user. A complementary flow-based analysis leads to a classification of users into five roles beyond the standard leader-follower dichotomy. Integrating both viewpoints, we find that interest communities fall into distinct informational organigrams, which reflect their mix of users and the quality of dialogue. Our generic framework provides insight into how flows are generated, distributed, preserved and consumed in directed networks.

010       Complex networks are an emerging property of hierarchical preferential   attachment
021       Real complex systems are not rigidly structured; no clear rules or blueprints exist for their construction. 
020       Yet, amidst their apparent randomness, complex structural properties appear to universally emerge. We propose that an important class of complex systems can be modelled as a construction of potentially infinitely many levels of organization all following the same universal growth principle known as preferential attachment. We give examples of such hierarchy in real systems, for instance in the pyramid of production entities of the movie industry. More importantly, we show how real complex networks can be interpreted as a projection of our model, from which their scale independence, their clustering or modularity, their hierarchy, their fractality and their navigability naturally emerge. Our results suggest that complex networks, viewed as growing systems, can be quite simple, and that the apparent complexity of their structure is largely a reflection of the hierarchical nature of our world.

010       A Unifying Framework for the Electrical Structure-Based Approach to PMU   Placement in Electric Power Systems
021       The electrical structure of the power grid is utilized to address the phasor measurement unit (PMU) placement problem. 
020       First, we derive the connectivity matrix of the network using the resistance distance metric and employ it in the linear program formulation to obtain the optimal number of PMUs, for complete network observability without zero injection measurements. This approach was developed by the author in an earlier work, but the solution methodology to address the location problem did not fully utilize the electrical properties of the network, resulting in an ambiguity. In this paper, we settle this issue by exploiting the coupling structure of the grid derived using the singular value decomposition (SVD)-based analysis of the resistance distance matrix to solve the location problem. Our study, which is based on recent advances in complex networks that promote the electrical structure of the grid over its topological structure and the SVD analysis which throws light on the electrical coupling of the network, results in a unified framework for the electrical structure-based PMU placement. The proposed method is tested on IEEE bus systems, and the results uncover intriguing connections between the singular vectors and average resistance distance between buses in the network.

010       Generalized Statistical Mechanics at the Onset of Chaos
021       Transitions to chaos in archetypal low-dimensional nonlinear maps offer real and precise model systems in which to assess proposed generalizations of statistical mechanics. 
020       The known association of chaotic dynamics with the structure of Boltzmann--Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics has suggested the potential verification of these generalizations at the onset of chaos, when the only Lyapunov exponent vanishes and ergodic and mixing properties cease to hold. There are three well-known routes to chaos in these deterministic dissipative systems, period-doubling, quasi-periodicity and intermittency, which provide the setting in which to explore the limit of validity of the standard BG structure. It has been shown that there is a rich and intricate behavior for both the dynamics within and towards the attractors at the onset of chaos and that these two kinds of properties are linked via generalized statistical-mechanical expressions. Amongst the topics presented are: (i) permanently growing sensitivity fluctuations and their infinite family of generalized Pesin identities; (ii) the emergence of statistical-mechanical structures in the dynamics along the routes to chaos; (iii) dynamical hierarchies with modular organization; and (iv) limit distributions of sums of deterministic variables. The occurrence of generalized entropy properties in condensed-matter physical systems is illustrated by considering critical fluctuations, localization transition and glass formation. We complete our presentation with the description of the manifestations of the dynamics at the transitions to chaos in various kinds of complex systems, such as, frequency and size rank distributions and complex network images of time series. We discuss the results.

010       Universally Optimal Noisy Quantum Walks on Complex Networks
021       Transport properties play a crucial role in several fields of science, as biology, chemistry, sociology, information science, and physics. 
020       The behavior of many dynamical processes running over complex networks is known to be closely related to the geometry of the underlying topology, but this connection becomes even harder to understand when quantum effects come into play. Here, we exploit the Kossakoski-Lindblad formalism of quantum stochastic walks to investigate the capability to quickly and robustly transmit energy (or information) between two distant points in very large complex structures, remarkably assisted by external noise and quantum features as coherence. An optimal mixing of classical and quantum transport is, very surprisingly, quite universal for a large class of complex networks. This widespread behaviour turns out to be also extremely robust with respect to geometry changes. These results might pave the way for designing optimal bio-inspired geometries of efficient transport nanostructures that can be used for solar energy and also quantum information and communication technologies.

010       Optimal, robust geometries for coherent excitation transport
021       Coherent transport promises to be the basis for an emerging new technology. 
020       Notwithstanding, a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental principles behind optimal scattering media is still missing. Here, complex network analysis is applied for the characterization of geometries that result in optimal coherent transport. The approach is tailored towards the elucidation of the subtle relationship between transport and geometry. Investigating systems with a different number of elementary units allows us to identify classes of structures which are common to all system sizes and which possess distinct robustness features. In particular, we find that small groups of two or three sites closely packed together that do not carry excitation at any time are fundamental to realize efficient and robust excitation transport. Features identified in small systems recur also in larger systems, what suggests that such strategy can efficiently be used to construct close-to-optimal transport properties irrespective of the system size.

010       Distance Closures on Complex Networks
021       To expand the toolbox available to network science, we study the isomorphism between distance and Fuzzy (proximity or strength) graphs. 
020       Distinct transitive closures in Fuzzy graphs lead to closures of their isomorphic distance graphs with widely different structural properties. For instance, the All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem, based on the Dijkstra algorithm, is equivalent to a metric closure, which is only one of the possible ways to calculate shortest paths. Understanding and mapping this isomorphism is necessary to analyse models of complex networks based on weighted graphs. Any conclusions derived from such models should take into account the distortions imposed on graph topology when converting proximity/strength into distance graphs, to subsequently compute path length and shortest path measures. We characterise the isomorphism using the max-min and Dombi disjunction/conjunction pairs. This allows us to: (1) study alternative distance closures, such as those based on diffusion, metric, and ultra-metric distances; (2) identify the operators closest to the metric closure of distance graphs (the APSP), but which are logically consistent; and (3) propose a simple method to compute alternative distance closures using existing algorithms for the APSP. In particular, we show that a specific diffusion distance is promising for community detection in complex networks, and is based on desirable axioms for logical inference or approximate reasoning on networks; it also provides a simple algebraic means to compute diffusion processes on networks. Based on these results, we argue that choosing different distance closures can lead to different conclusions about indirect associations on network data, as well as the structure of complex networks, and are thus important to consider.

010       Identification de r\^oles communautaires dans des r\&#x27;eseaux orient\&#x27;es   appliqu\&#x27;ee \`a Twitter
021       The notion of community structure is particularly useful when analyzing complex networks, because it provides an intermediate level, compared to the more classic global (whole network) and local (node neighborhood) approaches. 
020       The concept of community role of a node was derived from this base, in order to describe the position of a node in a network depending on its connectivity at the community level. However, the existing approaches are restricted to undirected networks, use topological measures which do not consider all aspects of community-related connectivity, and their role identification methods are not generalizable to all networks. We tackle these limitations by generalizing and extending the measures, and using an unsupervised approach to determine the roles. We then illustrate the applicability of our method by analyzing a Twitter network.We show how our modifications allow discovering the fact some particular users called social capitalists occupy very specific roles in this system. <br />--- <br />La notion de structure de communaut\'es est particuli\`erement utile pour \'etudier les r\'eseaux complexes, car elle am\`ene un niveau d'analyse interm\'ediaire, par opposition aux plus classiques niveaux local (voisinage des noeuds) et global (r\'eseau entier). Le concept de r\^ole communautaire permet de d\'ecrire le positionnement d'un noeud en fonction de sa connectivit\'e communautaire. Cependant, les approches existantes sont restreintes aux r\'eseaux non-orient\'es, utilisent des mesures topologiques ne consid\'erant pas tous les aspects de la connectivit\'e communautaire, et des m\'ethodes d'identification des r\^oles non-g\'en\'eralisables \`a tous les r\'eseaux.

021       Many complex systems are modeled through complex networks whose analysis reveals typical topological properties. 
020       Amongst those, the community structure is one of the most studied. Many methods are proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic networks. A community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set, which must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. We propose a method to support such a characterization task. We define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then characterize communities using the most representative emerging sequential patterns of its nodes. This also allows detecting unusual behavior in a community. We describe an empirical study of a network of scientific collaborations.---De nombreux syst\`emes complexes sont \'etudi\'es via l'analyse de r\'eseaux dits complexes ayant des propri\'et\'es topologiques typiques.

010       Non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks
021       Modeling structure in complex networks using Bayesian non-parametrics makes it possible to specify flexible model structures and infer the adequate model complexity from the observed data. 
020       This paper provides a gentle introduction to non-parametric Bayesian modeling of complex networks: Using an infinite mixture model as running example we go through the steps of deriving the model as an infinite limit of a finite parametric model, inferring the model parameters by Markov chain Monte Carlo, and checking the model's fit and predictive performance. We explain how advanced non-parametric models for complex networks can be derived and point out relevant literature.

010       Spreading dynamics in complex networks
021       Searching for influential spreaders in complex networks is an issue of great significance for applications across various domains, ranging from the epidemic control, innovation diffusion, viral marketing, social movement to idea propagation. 
020       In this paper, we first display some of the most important theoretical models that describe spreading processes, and then discuss the problem of locating both the individual and multiple influential spreaders respectively. Recent approaches in these two topics are presented. For the identification of privileged single spreaders, we summarize several widely used centralities, such as degree, betweenness centrality, PageRank, k-shell, etc. We investigate the empirical diffusion data in a large scale online social community -- LiveJournal. With this extensive dataset, we find that various measures can convey very distinct information of nodes. Of all the users in LiveJournal social network, only a small fraction of them involve in spreading. For the spreading processes in LiveJournal, while degree can locate nodes participating in information diffusion with higher probability, k-shell is more effective in finding nodes with large influence. Our results should provide useful information for designing efficient spreading strategies in reality.

010       Structural Vulnerability Assessment of Electric Power Grids
021       Cascading failures are the typical reasons of black- outs in power grids. 
020       The grid topology plays an important role in determining the dynamics of cascading failures in power grids. Measures for vulnerability analysis are crucial to assure a higher level of robustness of power grids. Metrics from Complex Networks are widely used to investigate the grid vulnerability. Yet, these purely topological metrics fail to capture the real behaviour of power grids. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, as a vulnerability measure to de- termine the critical components in a power grid. Differently than the existing purely topological measures, the effective graph resistance accounts for the electrical properties of power grids such as power flow allocation according to Kirchoff laws. To demonstrate the applicability of the effective graph resistance, a quantitative vulnerability assessment of the IEEE 118 buses power system is performed. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the effective graph resistance to identify the critical transmission lines in a power grid.

010       Noise Enhanced Activity in a Complex Network
021       We consider the influence of local noise on a generalized network of populations having positive and negative feedbacks. 
020       The population dynamics at the nodes is nonlinear, typically chaotic, and allows cessation of activity if the population falls below a threshold value. We investigate the global stability of this large interactive system, as indicated by the average number of nodal populations that manage to remain active. Our central result is that the probability of obtaining active nodes in this network is significantly enhanced under fluctuations. Further, we find a sharp transition in the number of active nodes as noise strength is varied, along with clearly evident scaling behaviour near the critical noise strength. Lastly, we also observe noise induced temporal coherence in the active sub-network, namely, there is an enhancement in synchrony among the nodes at an intermediate noise strength.

010       Weighted Multiplex Networks
021       One of the most important challenges in network science is to quantify the information encoded in complex network structures. 
020       Disentangling randomness from organizational principles is even more demanding when networks have a multiplex nature. Multiplex networks are multilayer systems of $N$ nodes that can be linked in multiple interacting and co-evolving layers. In these networks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were analyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers fails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of complex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex co-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the American Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly correlated with multiplex structure, and provide empirical evidence in favor of the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as multistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio. Finally, we introduce a theoretical framework based on the entropy of multiplex ensembles to quantify the information stored in multiplex networks that would remain undetected if the single layers were analyzed in isolation.

010       Contagion spreading on complex networks with local deterministic   dynamics
021       Typically, contagion strength is modeled by a transmission rate $\lambda$, whereby all nodes in a network are treated uniformly in a mean-field approximation. 
020       However, local agents react differently to the same contagion based on their local characteristics. Following our recent work [EPL \textbf{99}, 58002 (2012)], we investigate contagion spreading models with local dynamics on complex networks. We therefore quantify contagions by their quality, $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, and follow their spreading as their transmission condition (fitness) is evaluated by local agents. We choose various deterministic local rules. Initial spreading with exponential quality-dependent time scales is followed by a stationary state with a prevalence depending on the quality of the contagion. We also observe various interesting phenomena, for example, high prevalence without the participation of the hubs. This is in sharp contrast with the general belief that hubs play a central role in a typical spreading process. We further study the role of network topology in various models and find that as long as small-world effect exists, the underlying topology does not contribute to the final stationary state but only affects the initial spreading velocity.

010       Choice-Driven Phase Transition in Complex Networks
021       We investigate choice-driven network growth. 
020       In this model, nodes are added one by one according to the following procedure: for each addition event a set of target nodes is selected, each according to linear preferential attachment, and a new node attaches to the target with the highest degree. Depending on precise details of the attachment rule, the resulting networks has three possible outcomes: (i) a non-universal power-law degree distribution; (ii) a single macroscopic hub (a node whose degree is of the order of N, the number of network nodes), while the remainder of the nodes comprises a non-universal power-law degree distribution; (iii) a degree distribution that decays as (k ln k)^{-2} at the transition between cases (i) and (ii). These properties are robust when attachment occurs to the highest-degree node from at least two targets. When attachment is made to a target whose degree is not the highest, the degree distribution has the ultra-narrow double-exponential form exp(-const. x e^k), from which the largest degree grows only as ln(ln N).

010       Mean field approximation for biased diffusion on Japanese inter-firm   trading network
021       By analysing the financial data of firms across Japan, a nonlinear power law with an exponent of 1.3 was observed between the number of business partners (i.e. 
020       the degree of the inter-firm trading network) and sales. In a previous study using numerical simulations, we found that this scaling can be explained by both the money-transport model, where a firm (i.e. customer) distributes money to its out-edges (suppliers) in proportion to the in-degree of destinations, and by the correlations among the Japanese inter-firm trading network. However, in this previous study, we could not specifically identify what types of structure properties (or correlations) of the network determine the 1.3 exponent. In the present study, we more clearly elucidate the relationship between this nonlinear scaling and the network structure by applying mean-field approximation of the diffusion in a complex network to this money-transport model. Using theoretical analysis, we obtained the mean-field solution of the model and found that, in the case of the Japanese firms, the scaling exponent of 1.3 can be determined from the power law of the average degree of the nearest neighbours of the network with an exponent of -0.7.

010       Traffic congestion in interconnected complex networks
021       Traffic congestion in isolated complex networks has been investigated extensively over the last decade. 
020       Coupled network models have recently been developed to facilitate further understanding of real complex systems. Analysis of traffic congestion in coupled complex networks, however, is still relatively unexplored. In this paper, we try to explore the effect of interconnections on traffic congestion in interconnected BA scale-free networks. We find that assortative coupling can alleviate traffic congestion more readily than disassortative and random coupling when the node processing capacity is allocated based on node usage probability. Furthermore, the optimal coupling probability can be found for assortative coupling. However, three types of coupling preferences achieve similar traffic performance if all nodes share the same processing capacity. We analyze interconnected Internet AS-level graphs of South Korea and Japan and obtain similar results. Some practical suggestions are presented to optimize such real-world interconnected networks accordingly.

021       Recent advances in neuroscience have motivated the study of network organization in spatially distributed dynamical systems from indirect measurements. 
020       However, the associated connectivity estimation, when combined with inverse modeling, is strongly affected by spatial leakage. We formulate this problem in a general framework and develop a new approach to model spatial leakage and limit its effects. It is analytically compared to existing regression-based methods used in electrophysiology, which are shown to yield biased estimates of amplitude and phase couplings.

010       Generalized friendship paradox in complex networks: The case of   scientific collaboration
021       The friendship paradox states that your friends have on average more friends than you have. 
020       Does the paradox "hold" for other individual characteristics like income or happiness? To address this question, we generalize the friendship paradox for arbitrary node characteristics in complex networks. By analyzing two coauthorship networks of Physical Review journals and Google Scholar profiles, we find that the generalized friendship paradox (GFP) holds at the individual and network levels for various characteristics, including the number of coauthors, the number of citations, and the number of publications. The origin of the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degree and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high characteristic nodes in large-scale networks. Our study on the GFP can shed lights on understanding the interplay between network structure and node characteristics in complex networks.

010       Small-world networks of optical fiber lattices
021       We use a simple dynamical model and explore coherent dynamics of wavepackets in complex networks of optical fibers. 
020       We start from a symmetric lattice and through the application of a Monte-Carlo criterion we introduce structural disorder and deform the lattice into a small-world network regime. We investigate in the latter both structural (correlation length) as well as dynamical (diffusion exponent) properties and find that both exhibit a rapid crossover from the ordered to the fully random regime. For a critical value of the structural disorder parameter $\rho \approx 0.25$ transport changes from ballistic to sub-diffusive due to the creation strongly connected local clusters and channels of preferential transport in the small world regime.

010       Communities of dense weighted networks: MicroRNA co-target network as an   example
021       Complex networks are intrinsically modular. 
020       Resolving small modules is particularly difficult when the network is densely connected; wide variation of link weights invites additional complexities. In this article we present an algorithm to detect community structure in densely connected weighted networks. First, modularity of the network is calculated by erasing the links having weights smaller than a cutoff $q.$ Then one takes all the disjoint components obtained at $q=q_c,$ where the modularity is maximum, and modularize the components individually using Newman Girvan's algorithm for weighted networks. We show, taking microRNA (miRNA) co-target network of Homo sapiens as an example, that this algorithm could reveal miRNA modules which are known to be relevant in biological context.

010       Embedding Graphs under Centrality Constraints for Network Visualization
021       Visual rendering of graphs is a key task in the mapping of complex network data. 
020       Although most graph drawing algorithms emphasize aesthetic appeal, certain applications such as travel-time maps place more importance on visualization of structural network properties. The present paper advocates two graph embedding approaches with centrality considerations to comply with node hierarchy. The problem is formulated first as one of constrained multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and it is solved via block coordinate descent iterations with successive approximations and guaranteed convergence to a KKT point. In addition, a regularization term enforcing graph smoothness is incorporated with the goal of reducing edge crossings. A second approach leverages the locally-linear embedding (LLE) algorithm which assumes that the graph encodes data sampled from a low-dimensional manifold. Closed-form solutions to the resulting centrality-constrained optimization problems are determined yielding meaningful embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both approaches, especially for visualizing large networks on the order of thousands of nodes.

010       YASCA: A collective intelligence approach for community detection in   complex networks
021       In this paper we present an original approach for community detection in complex networks. 
020       The approach belongs to the family of seed-centric algorithms. However, instead of expanding communities around selected seeds as most of existing approaches do, we explore here applying an ensemble clustering approach to different network partitions derived from ego-centered communities computed for each selected seed. Ego-centered communities are themselves computed applying a recently proposed ensemble ranking based approach that allow to efficiently combine various local modularities used to guide a greedy optimisation process. Results of first experiments on real world networks for which a ground truth decomposition into communities are known, argue for the validity of our approach.

010       Multiple Hybrid Phase Transition: Bootstrap Percolation on Complex   Networks with Communities
021       Bootstrap percolation is a well-known model to study the spreading of rumors, new products or innovations on social networks. 
020       The empirical studies show that community structure is ubiquitous among various social networks. Thus, studying the bootstrap percolation on the complex networks with communities can bring us new and important insights of the spreading dynamics on social networks. It attracts a lot of scientists' attentions recently. In this letter, we study the bootstrap percolation on Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks with communities and observed second order, hybrid (both second and first order) and multiple hybrid phase transitions, which is rare in natural system. Moreover, we have analytically solved this system and obtained the phase diagram, which is further justified well by the corresponding simulations.

010       Controllability of a swarm of topologically interacting autonomous   agents
021       Controllability of complex networks has been the focal point of many recent studies in the field of complexity. 
020       These landmark advances shed a new light on the dynamics of natural and technological complex systems. Here, we analyze the controllability of a swarm of autonomous self-propelled agents having a topological neighborhood of interactions, applying the analytical tools developed for the study of the controllability of arbitrary complex directed networks. To this aim we thoroughly investigate the structural properties of the swarm signaling network which is the information transfer channel underpinning the dynamics of agents in the physical space. Our results show that with 6 or 7 topological neighbors, every agent not only affects, but is also affected by all other agents within the group. More importantly, still with 6 or 7 topological neighbors, each agent is capable of full control over all other agents. This finding is yet another argument justifying the particular value of the number of topological neighbors observed in field observations with flocks of starlings.

010       Information content: assessing meso-scale structures in complex networks
021       We propose a novel measure to assess the presence of meso-scale structures in complex networks. 
020       This measure is based on the identification of regular patterns in the adjacency matrix of the network, and on the calculation of the quantity of information lost when pairs of nodes are iteratively merged. We show how this measure is able to quantify several meso-scale structures, like the presence of modularity, bipartite and core-periphery configurations, or motifs. Results corresponding to a large set of real networks are used to validate its ability to detect non-trivial topological patterns.

010       Early warning signs for saddle-escape transitions in complex networks
021       Many real world systems are at risk of undergoing critical transitions, leading to sudden qualitative and sometimes irreversible regime shifts \cite{Schefferetal,Lentonetal}. 
020       Because these transitions are often detrimental, the development of early warning signals is recognized as a major challenge \cite{BoettingerRossHastings}. Recent progress \cite{CarpenterBrock,KuehnCT1,AshwinWieczorekVitoloCox} builds on a mathematical framework in which the real-world system at hand is described by a low-dimensional equation system that captures the dynamics in terms of a small number of key variables. In this framework the critical transition often corresponds to a bifurcation. Here we show that in high-dimensional systems, containing many variables, we frequently encounter an additional non-bifurcative mechanism that can lead to critical transitions. We develop a simple and intuitive early warning sign and illustrate both, mechanism and warning sign, in a range of examples, including network models of epidemics \cite{GrossDLimaBlasius} and cooperation \cite{ZschalerTraulsenGross} and epidemiological data \cite{BjornstadFinkenstaedtGrenfell,GrenfellBjornstadFinkenstaedt}. This work thus establishes a connection between critical transitions and network science and provides an early warning sign for a new type of critical transition that could be relevant for many real world systems. In particular, in the light of the perspective to move to more complex models and utilize big data sources it can be anticipated that this new type of transition will be encountered frequently in the future.

010       Performance Rescaling of Complex Networks
021       Recent progress in network topology modeling [1], [2] has shown that it is possible to create smaller-scale replicas of large complex networks, like the Internet, while simultaneously preserving several important topological properties. 
020       However, the constructed replicas do not include notions of capacities and latencies, and the fundamental question of whether smaller networks can reproduce the performance of larger networks remains unanswered. We address this question in this letter, and show that it is possible to predict the performance of larger networks from smaller replicas, as long as the right link capacities and propagation delays are assigned to the replica's links. Our procedure is inspired by techniques introduced in [2] and combines a time-downscaling argument from [3]. We show that significant computational savings can be achieved when simulating smaller-scale replicas with TCP and UDP traffic, with simulation times being reduced by up to two orders of magnitude.

010       Double percolation phase transition in clustered complex networks
021       The internal organization of complex networks often has striking consequences on either their response to external perturbations or on their dynamical properties. 
020       In addition to small-world and scale-free properties, clustering is the most common topological characteristic observed in many real networked systems. In this paper, we report an extensive numerical study on the effects of clustering on the structural properties of complex networks. Strong clustering in heterogeneous networks induces the emergence of a core-periphery organization that has a critical effect on the percolation properties of the networks. We observe a novel double phase transition with an intermediate phase in which only the core of the network is percolated and a final phase in which the periphery percolates regardless of the core. This result implies breaking of the same symmetry at two different values of the control parameter, in stark contrast to the modern theory of continuous phase transitions. Inspired by this core-periphery organization, we introduce a simple model that allows us to analytically prove that such an anomalous phase transition is in fact possible.

010       Classifying Latent Infection States in Complex Networks
021       Algorithms for identifying the infection states of nodes in a network are crucial for understanding and containing infections. 
020       Often, however, only a relatively small set of nodes have a known infection state. Moreover, the length of time that each node has been infected is also unknown. This missing data -- infection state of most nodes and infection time of the unobserved infected nodes -- poses a challenge to the study of real-world cascades. <br />In this work, we develop techniques to identify the latent infected nodes in the presence of missing infection time-and-state data. Based on the likely epidemic paths predicted by the simple susceptible-infected epidemic model, we propose a measure (Infection Betweenness) for uncovering these unknown infection states. Our experimental results using machine learning algorithms show that Infection Betweenness is the most effective feature for identifying latent infected nodes.

020       They have been used in very different domains such as computer science, biology, sociology, management, etc. Authors have been trying to characterize them using various measures such as degree distribution, transitivity or average distance. Their goal is to detect certain properties such as the small-world or scale-free properties. Previous works have shown some of these properties are present in many different systems, while others are characteristic of certain types of systems only. However, each one of these studies generally focuses on a very small number of topological measures and networks. In this work, we aim at using a more systematic approach. We first constitute a dataset of 152 publicly available networks, spanning over 7 different domains. We then process 14 different topological measures to characterize them in the most possible complete way. Finally, we apply standard data mining tools to analyze these data. A cluster analysis reveals it is possible to obtain two significantly distinct clusters of networks, corresponding roughly to a bisection of the domains modeled by the networks. On these data, the most discriminant measures are density, modularity, average degree and transitivity, and at a lesser extent, closeness and edgebetweenness centralities.Abstract--Complex networks are a powerful modeling tool, allowing the study of countless real-world systems.

010       Scaling Concepts in Graph Thoery: Self-Avoiding Walk on Fractal Complex   Networks
021       It was discovered a few years ago that many networks in the real world exhibit self-similarity. 
020       A lot of researches on the structures and processes on real and artificial fractal complex networks have been done, drawing an analogy to critical phenomena. However, the non-Markovian dynamics on fractal networks has not been understood well yet. We here study the self-avoiding walk on complex fractal networks through the mapping of the self-avoiding walk to the n-vector model by a generating function formalism. First, we analytically calculate the critical exponent {\nu} and the effective coordination number (the connective constant) by a renormalization-group analysis in various fractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\nu} is equal to the exponent of displacement, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest distance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution, we present an example which supports the well-known conjecture that the universality class of the self-avoiding walk is not determined only by a fractal dimension. Our finding suggests that the scaling theory of polymers can be applied to graphs which lack the Euclidian distance as well. Furthermore, the self-avoiding walk has been exactly solved only on a few lattices embedded in the Euclidian space, but we show that consideration on general graphs can simplify analytic calculations and leads to a better understanding of critical phenomena. The scaling theory of the self-avoiding path will shed light on the relationship between path numeration problems in graph theory and statistical nature of paths.

010       Flows in Complex Networks: Theory, Algorithms, and Application to   Lennard-Jones Cluster Rearrangement
021       A set of analytical and computational tools based on transition path theory (TPT) is proposed to analyze flows in complex networks. 
020       Specifically, TPT is used to study the statistical properties of the reactive trajectories by which transitions occur between specific groups of nodes on the network. Sampling tools are built upon the outputs of TPT that allow to generate these reactive trajectories directly, or even transition paths that travel from one group of nodes to the other without making any detour and carry the same probability current as the reactive trajectories. These objects permit to characterize the mechanism of the transitions, for example by quantifying the width of the tubes by which these transitions occur, the location and distribution of their dynamical bottlenecks, etc. These tools are applied to a network modeling the dynamics of the Lennard-Jones cluster with 38 atoms (LJ38) and used to understand the mechanism by which this cluster rearranges itself between its two most likely states at various temperatures.

010       Robustness of complex many-body networks: Novel perspective in 2D   metal-insulator transition
021       We present a novel theoretical framework established by complex network analysis for understanding the phase transition beyond the Landau symmetry breaking paradigm. 
020       In this paper we take a two-dimensional metal-insulator transition driven by electron correlations for example. Passing through the transition point, we find a hidden symmetry broken in the network space, which is invisible in real space. This symmetry is nothing but a kind of robustness of the network to random failures. We then show that a network quantity, small-worldness, is capable of identifying the phase transition with/without any symmetry breaking in the real space and behaving as a new order parameter in the network space. We demonstrate that whether or not the symmetry is broken in real space a variety of phase transitions in condensed matters can be characterized by the hidden symmetry breaking in the weighted network, that is to say, a decline in network robustness.

010       Measuring and Understanding Throughput of Network Topologies
021       In settings varying from transport networks to communication networks, a fundamental goal of network design has been to achieve high throughput. 
020       While myriad network designs have been proposed, particularly in the data center and HPC networking communities, a consistent and accurate method of predicting a design's throughput performance and comparing it to past proposals is conspicuously absent. <br />In this work, we develop a framework to benchmark the throughput of network topologies and apply this methodology to reveal insights about network structure. First, we show that despite being commonly used, cut-based metrics such as bisection bandwidth are the wrong metrics: they yield incorrect conclusions about the throughput performance of networks. We therefore measure flow-based throughput directly and show how to evaluate topologies with nearly- worst-case traffic matrices. Next, we use these metrics to analyze the throughput performance of a variety of networks. We evaluate networks used in data centers and high performance computing, and find that random graphs outperform the carefully-structured networks. We also evaluate several real-world complex networks and observe that throughput varies widely, and is not captured by other graph metrics such as betweenness or clustering coefficient. Finally, we study whether proposed models of complex networks are able to capture the throughput of real networks. <br />We have made our evaluation framework freely available to facilitate future work on rigorously designing and evaluating networks, and reproducing results.

010       Tree-based Coarsening and Partitioning of Complex Networks
021       Many applications produce massive complex networks whose analysis would benefit from parallel processing. 
020       Parallel algorithms, in turn, often require a suitable network partition. For solving optimization tasks such as graph partitioning on large networks, multilevel methods are preferred in practice. Yet, complex networks pose challenges to established multilevel algorithms, in particular to their coarsening phase. <br />One way to specify a (recursive) coarsening of a graph is to rate its edges and then contract the edges as prioritized by the rating. In this paper we (i) define weights for the edges of a network that express the edges' importance for connectivity, (ii) compute a minimum weight spanning tree $T^m$ with respect to these weights, and (iii) rate the network edges based on the conductance values of $T^m$'s fundamental cuts. To this end, we also (iv) develop the first optimal linear-time algorithm to compute the conductance values of \emph{all} fundamental cuts of a given spanning tree. We integrate the new edge rating into a leading multilevel graph partitioner and equip the latter with a new greedy postprocessing for optimizing the maximum communication volume (MCV). Experiments on bipartitioning frequently used benchmark networks show that the postprocessing already reduces MCV by 11.3%. Our new edge rating further reduces MCV by 10.3% compared to the previously best rating with the postprocessing in place for both ratings. In total, with a modest increase in running time, our new approach reduces the MCV of complex network partitions by 20.4%.

010       Heterogeneous pair-approximation for the contact process on complex   networks
021       Recent works have shown that the contact process running on the top of highly heterogeneous random networks is described by the heterogeneous mean-field theory. 
020       However, some important aspects as the transition point and strong corrections to the finite-size scaling observed in simulations are not quantitatively reproduced in this theory. We develop a heterogeneous pair approximation, the simplest mean-field approach that takes into account dynamical correlations, for the contact process. The transition points obtained in this theory are in very good agreement with simulations. The proximity with a simple homogeneous pair-approximation is elicited showing that the transition point in successive homogeneous cluster approximations moves away from the simulation results. We show that the critical exponents of the heterogeneous pair-approximation in the infinite-size limit are the same as those of the one-vertex theory. However, excellent matches with simulations, for a wide range of network sizes, is obtained when sub-leading finite-size corrections given by the new theory are explicitly taken into account. The present approach can be suited to dynamical processes on networks in general providing a profitable strategy to analytically assess fine-tuning theoretical corrections.

010       Computing the Asymptotic Spectrum for Networks Representing Energy   Landscapes using the Minimal Spanning Tree
021       The concept of metastability has caused a lot of interest in recent years. 
020       The spectral decomposition of the generator matrix of a stochastic network exposes all of the transition processes in the system. The assumption of the existence of a low lying group of eigenvalues separated by a spectral gap, leading to factorization of the dynamics, has become a popular theme. We consider stochastic networks representing potential energy landscapes where the states and the edges correspond to local minima and transition states respectively, and the pairwise transition rates are given by the Arrhenuis formula. Using the minimal spanning tree, we construct the asymptotics for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the generator matrix starting from the low lying group. This construction gives rise to an efficient algorithm for computing the asymptotic spectrum suitable for large and complex networks. We apply it to Wales's Lennard-Jones-38 network with 71887 states and 119853 edges where the underlying potential energy landscape has a double-funnel structure. Our results demonstrate that the concept of metastability should be applied with care to this system. In particular, for the full network, there is no significant spectral gap separating the eigenvalue corresponding to the exit from the wider and shallower icosahedral funnel at any reasonable temperature range.

010       Local Optima Networks: A New Model of Combinatorial Fitness Landscapes
021       This chapter overviews a recently introduced network-based model of combinatorial landscapes: Local Optima Networks (LON). 
020       The model compresses the information given by the whole search space into a smaller mathematical object that is a graph having as vertices the local optima and as edges the possible weighted transitions between them. Two definitions of edges have been proposed: basin-transition and escape-edges, which capture relevant topological features of the underlying search spaces. This network model brings a new set of metrics to characterize the structure of combinatorial landscapes, those associated with the science of complex networks. These metrics are described, and results are presented of local optima network extraction and analysis for two selected combinatorial landscapes: NK landscapes and the quadratic assignment problem. Network features are found to correlate with and even predict the performance of heuristic search algorithms operating on these problems.

010       Partitioning Complex Networks via Size-constrained Clustering
021       The most commonly used method to tackle the graph partitioning problem in practice is the multilevel approach. 
020       During a coarsening phase, a multilevel graph partitioning algorithm reduces the graph size by iteratively contracting nodes and edges until the graph is small enough to be partitioned by some other algorithm. A partition of the input graph is then constructed by successively transferring the solution to the next finer graph and applying a local search algorithm to improve the current solution. <br />In this paper, we describe a novel approach to partition graphs effectively especially if the networks have a highly irregular structure. More precisely, our algorithm provides graph coarsening by iteratively contracting size-constrained clusterings that are computed using a label propagation algorithm. The same algorithm that provides the size-constrained clusterings can also be used during uncoarsening as a fast and simple local search algorithm. <br />Depending on the algorithm's configuration, we are able to compute partitions of very high quality outperforming all competitors, or partitions that are comparable to the best competitor in terms of quality, hMetis, while being nearly an order of magnitude faster on average. The fastest configuration partitions the largest graph available to us with 3.3 billion edges using a single machine in about ten minutes while cutting less than half of the edges than the fastest competitor, kMetis.

010       The complex architecture of primes and natural numbers
021       Natural numbers can be divided in two non-overlapping infinite sets, primes and composites, with composites factorizing into primes. 
020       Despite their apparent simplicity, the elucidation of the architecture of natural numbers with primes as building blocks remains elusive. Here, we propose a new approach to decoding the architecture of natural numbers based on complex networks and stochastic processes theory. We introduce a parameter-free non-Markovian dynamical model that naturally generates random primes and their relation with composite numbers with remarkable accuracy. Our model satisfies the prime number theorem as an emerging property and a refined version of Cram\'er's conjecture about the statistics of gaps between consecutive primes that seems closer to reality than the original Cram\'er's version. Regarding composites, the model helps us to derive the prime factors counting function, giving the probability of distinct prime factors for any integer. Probabilistic models like ours can help not only to conjecture but also to prove results about primes and the complex architecture of natural numbers.

010       Shock waves on complex networks
021       Power grids, road maps, and river streams are examples of infrastructural networks which are highly vulnerable to external perturbations. 
020       An abrupt local change of load (voltage, traffic density, or water level) might propagate in a cascading way and affect a significant fraction of the network. Almost discontinuous perturbations can be modeled by shock waves which can eventually interfere constructively and endanger the normal functionality of the infrastructure. We study their dynamics by solving the Burgers equation under random perturbations on several real and artificial directed graphs. Even for graphs with a narrow distribution of node properties (e.g., degree or betweenness), a steady state is reached exhibiting a heterogeneous load distribution, having a difference of one order of magnitude between the highest and average loads. Unexpectedly we find for the European power grid and for finite Watts-Strogatz networks a broad pronounced bimodal distribution for the loads. To identify the most vulnerable nodes, we introduce the concept of node-basin size, a purely topological property which we show to be strongly correlated to the average load of a node.

010       Fluctuations analysis in complex networks modeled by hidden variable   models. Necessity of a large cut-off in hidden-variable models
021       It is becoming more and more clear that complex networks present remarkable large fluctuations. 
020       These fluctuations may manifest differently according to the given model. In this paper we re-consider hidden variable models which turn out to be more analytically treatable and for which we have recently shown clear evidence of non-self averaging; the density of a motif being subject to possible uncontrollable fluctuations in the infinite size limit. Here we provide full detailed calculations and we show that large fluctuations are only due to the node hidden variables variability while, in ensembles where these are frozen, fluctuations are negligible in the thermodynamic limit, and equal the fluctuations of classical random graphs. A special attention is paid to the choice of the cut-off: we show that in hidden-variable models, only a cut-off growing as $N^\lambda$ with $\lambda\geq 1$ can reproduce the scaling of a power-law degree distribution. In turn, it is this large cut-off that generates non-self-averaging.

010       Mapping systemic risk: critical degree and failures distribution in   financial networks
021       The 2008 financial crisis illustrated the need for a thorough, functional understanding of systemic risk in strongly interconnected financial structures. 
020       Dynamic processes on complex networks being intrinsically difficult, most recent studies of this problem have relied on numerical simulations. Here we report analytical results in a network model of interbank lending based on directly relevant financial parameters, such as interest rates and leverage ratios. Using a mean-field approach, we obtain a closed-form formula for the "critical degree", viz. the number of creditors per bank below which an individual shock can propagate throughout the network. We relate the failures distribution (probability that a single shock induces $F$ failures) to the degree distribution (probability that a bank has $k$ creditors), showing in particular that the former is fat-tailed whenever the latter is. Our criterion for the onset of contagion turns out to be isomorphic to the condition for cooperation to evolve on graphs and social networks, as recently formulated in evolutionary game theory. This remarkable connection supports recent calls for a methodological rapprochement between finance and ecology.

010       Emergence of assortative mixing between clusters of cultured neurons
021       The analysis of the activity of neuronal cultures is considered to be a good proxy of the functional connectivity of in vivo neuronal tissues. 
020       Thus, the functional complex network inferred from activity patterns is a promising way to unravel the interplay between structure and functionality of neuronal systems. Here, we monitor the spontaneous self-sustained dynamics in neuronal clusters formed by interconnected aggregates of neurons. The analysis of the time delays between ignition sequences of the clusters allows the reconstruction of the directed functional connectivity of the network. We propose a method to statistically infer this connectivity and analyze the resulting properties of the associated complex networks. Surprisingly enough, in contrast to what has been reported for many biological networks, the clustered neuronal cultures present assortative mixing connectivity values, meaning that there is a preference for clusters to link to other clusters that share similar functional connectivity. These results point out that the grouping of neurons and the assortative connectivity between clusters are intrinsic survival mechanisms of the culture.

010       Analysis of cluster explosive synchronization in complex networks
021       Correlations between intrinsic dynamics and local topology have become a new trend in the study of synchronization in complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we investigate in this paradigm the influence of topology on dynamics of networks made up of second-order Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, based on mean-field calculations, we provide a detailed investigation of the recently reported phenomena of cluster explosive synchronization (CES)[Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 218701 (2013)], analysing the model in scale-free and small-world networks as a function of several topological properties. We show that, in contrast to scale-free networks, the transition to the synchronous state in small-world structures tends to be continuous as the probability of rewiring increases. These results complement the previous findings regarding CES and also fundamentally deepen the understanding of the interplay between topology and dynamics under the constraint of correlating natural frequencies and local structure.

010       Evaluation of node importance in complex networks
021       The assessment of node importance has been a fundamental issue in the research of complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we propose to use the Shannon-Parry measure (SPM) to evaluate the importance of a node quantitatively, because SPM is the stationary distribution of the most unprejudiced random walk on the network. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of SPM compared with several popular methods in the Zachary karate club network and three toy networks. We apply SPM to analyze the city importance of China Railways High-speed (CRH) network, and obtain reasonable results. Since SPM can be used effectively in weighted and directed network, we believe it is a relevant method to identify key nodes in networks.

010       On the influence of topological characteristics on robustness of complex   networks
021       In this paper, we explore the relationship between the topological characteristics of a complex network and its robustness to sustained targeted attacks. 
020       Using synthesised scale-free, small-world and random networks, we look at a number of network measures, including assortativity, modularity, average path length, clustering coefficient, rich club profiles and scale-free exponent (where applicable) of a network, and how each of these influence the robustness of a network under targeted attacks. We use an established robustness coefficient to measure topological robustness, and consider sustained targeted attacks by order of node degree. With respect to scale-free networks, we show that assortativity, modularity and average path length have a positive correlation with network robustness, whereas clustering coefficient has a negative correlation. We did not find any correlation between scale-free exponent and robustness, or rich-club profiles and robustness. The robustness of small-world networks on the other hand, show substantial positive correlations with assortativity, modularity, clustering coefficient and average path length. In comparison, the robustness of Erdos-Renyi random networks did not have any significant correlation with any of the network properties considered. A significant observation is that high clustering decreases topological robustness in scale-free networks, yet it increases topological robustness in small-world networks. Our results highlight the importance of topological characteristics in influencing network robustness, and illustrate design strategies network designers can use to increase the robustness of scale-free and small-world networks under sustained targeted attacks.

010       Multi-fractal analysis of weighted networks
021       In many real complex networks, the fractal and self-similarity properties have been found. 
020       The fractal dimension is a useful method to describe fractal property of complex networks. Fractal analysis is inadequate if only taking one fractal dimension to study complex networks. In this case, multifractal analysis of complex networks are concerned. However, multifractal dimension of weighted networks are less involved. In this paper, multifractal dimension of weighted networks is proposed based on box-covering algorithm for fractal dimension of weighted networks (BCANw). The proposed method is applied to calculate the fractal dimensions of some real networks. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed method is efficient for analysis fractal property of weighted networks.

We highlight its utility in two general problems: constrained frequency allocation and network design. In general, we find that synchronization is promoted by strong alignments between frequencies and the dominant Laplacian eigenvectors, as well as a matching between the heterogeneity of frequencies and network structure.

010       Universal Symmetry in Complex Network Control
021       Major advances have been made recently towards understanding how to control large networks by acting only on a small subset of their elements, illuminating the impact of a network's topology on its controllability. 
020       Yet, a detailed understanding of the synergies between network topology and intrinsic individual dynamics is still lacking. Here we offer a theoretical framework to evaluate the controllability of complex networked systems with particular interest in the diversity of dynamic units characterized by different types of individual dynamics. Surprisingly, we find a universal symmetry accounting for the invariance of controllability with respect to exchanging the densities of any two different types of dynamic units, irrespective of the network topology. The highest controllability arises at the global symmetry point, at which different types of dynamic units have the same density. These findings have important implications for devising effective and sparse controllers of complex networked systems in a wide range of fields.

010       Automatic structural regularities exploration in complex networks
021       Complex networks as a concise mathematical representation of complex systems have gained considerable attention during the past several years. 
020       Understanding the structure of these networks is one of the main challenges for complex network analysis. Most of the existing methods for network structure detection perform well on the condition of some prior knowledge, i.e. the structure type specifying what we are looking for or the structure numbers specifying how many components are composed of. However, in reality most of networks are unkown to us. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric mixture (BNPM) model for exploring structural regularities that nodes of the same group have similar patterns of connections to other groups. We show that it is possible to automatically explore a very broad range of types of structure as well as the number of structure in an unknown network. Experiments on a number of real and synthetic networks show that our BNPM model can: (i) explore structural regularities, including the structure types and structure numbers; (ii) detect overlapping communities; (iii) work well on both directed and undirected networks.

010       Chromatin loops as modulators of enhancer-promoter interactions in their   vicinity
021       The classic model of eukaryotic gene expression requires direct spatial contact between a distal enhancer and a proximal promoter. 
020       However, recent chromosome conformation capture studies (e.g. Hi-C) show that enhancer and promoters are embedded in a complex network of cell-type specific looping interactions. Here we investigate whether, and to what extent, looping interactions between elements in the vicinity of an enhancer- promoter pair can influence the frequency of enhancer-promoter contacts. Our polymer simulations show that a chromatin loop formed by elements flanking either an enhancer or a promoter suppresses enhancer-promoter interactions, working as a topological insulator. A loop formed by elements located in the region between an enhancer and a promoter, on the contrary, facilitates their interactions. We find that these two consequences of chromatin loops have different genomic extents, with facilitation being a local effect and insulation persisting over a large range of genomic distances. Overall, our results show that looping interactions which do not directly involve an enhancer-promoter contact can nevertheless significantly modulate their interactions. This illustrates the intricate effects that local chromatin organization can have on gene expression.

010       Critical phenomena of social complex network
021       We propose a multi-state spin model in order to describe equilibrial behavior of a society. 
020       Our physical spin system is inspired by the Axelrod model used in social network studies. In the framework of the statistical mechanics language, we analyze phase transitions of our model in which the spin interactions are interpreted as a mutual communication among individuals forming a society. The thermal fluctuations introduce a noise into the communication which suppresses long-range correlations. Below a certain phase transition point, large-scale groups of the individuals, who share a specific dominant property, are formed. The measure of the group sizes is an order parameter after the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism has occurred. By means of the Corner transfer matrix renormalization group algorithm, we treat our model in the thermodynamic limit and classify the phase transitions with respect to inherent degrees of freedom. Each individual is chosen to have two independent features and each feature has $q$ traits (e.g. interests). A single first order phase transition is detected in our model if $q&gt;2$, whereas two distinct continuous phase transitions are found if $q=2$. Evaluating the free energy, order parameters, specific heat, and the entanglement entropy, we classify the phase transitions in detail. The permanent existence of the ordered phase (the large-scale group formation) is conjectured below a non-zero transition point $T_t\approx0.5$ in the asymptotic regime $q\to\infty$.

010       NetworKit: An Interactive Tool Suite for High-Performance Network   Analysis
021       We introduce NetworKit, an open-source software package for high-performance analysis of large complex networks. 
020       Complex networks are equally attractive and challenging targets for data mining, and novel algorithmic solutions as well as parallelization are required to handle data sets containing billions of connections. Our goal for NetworKit is to package results of our algorithm engineering efforts and put them into the hands of domain experts. NetworKit is a hybrid combining the performance of kernels written in C++ with a convenient interactive interface written in Python. The package supports shared-memory parallelism and scales from notebooks to compute servers. In comparison with related software, we propose NetworKit as a package geared towards large networks and satisfying three important criteria: High performance, interactive workflows and integration into an ecosystem of tested tools for data analysis and scientific computation. The current feature set includes analytics kernels such as degree distribution, connected components, clustering coefficients, community detection, k-core decomposition, degree assortativity and multiple centrality indices. Moreover, NetworKit comes with a collection of graph generators. With the current release, we present and open up the project to a community of both algorithm engineers and domain experts

010       Coloring Large Complex Networks
021       Given a large social or information network, how can we partition the vertices into sets (i.e., colors) such that no two vertices linked by an edge are in the same set while minimizing the number of sets used. 
020       Despite the obvious practical importance of graph coloring, existing work has not systematically investigated or designed methods for large complex networks. In this work, we develop a unified framework for coloring large complex networks that consists of two main coloring variants that effectively balances the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency. Using this framework as a fundamental basis, we propose coloring methods designed for the scale and structure of complex networks. In particular, the methods leverage triangles, triangle-cores, and other egonet properties and their combinations. We systematically compare the proposed methods across a wide range of networks (e.g., social, web, biological networks) and find a significant improvement over previous approaches in nearly all cases. Additionally, the solutions obtained are nearly optimal and sometimes provably optimal for certain classes of graphs (e.g., collaboration networks). The coloring is also shown to be extremely effective for detecting graph outliers as well as graph classification (i.e., predicting the type of a graph). We also propose a parallel algorithm for the problem of coloring neighborhood subgraphs and make several key observations. Overall, the coloring methods are shown to be (i) accurate with solutions close to optimal, (ii) fast and scalable for large networks, and (iii) flexible for use in a variety of applications.

010       Symmetry in Critical Random Boolean Network Dynamics
021       Using Boolean networks as prototypical examples, the role of symmetry in the dynamics of heterogeneous complex systems is explored. 
020       We show that symmetry of the dynamics, especially in critical states, is a controlling feature that can be used both to greatly simplify analysis and to characterize different types of dynamics. Symmetry in Boolean networks is found by determining the frequency at which the various Boolean output functions occur. There are classes of functions that consist of Boolean functions that behave similarly. These classes are orbits of the controlling symmetry group. We find that the symmetry that controls the critical random Boolean networks is expressed through the frequency by which output functions are utilized by nodes that remain active on dynamical attractors. This symmetry preserves canalization, a form of network robustness. We compare it to a different symmetry known to control the dynamics of an evolutionary process that allows Boolean networks to organize into a critical state. Our results demonstrate the usefulness and power of using the symmetry of the behavior of the nodes to characterize complex network dynamics, and introduce a novel approach to the analysis of heterogeneous complex systems.

010       Topological properties and fractal analysis of recurrence network   constructed from fractional Brownian motions
021       Many studies have shown that we can gain additional information on time series by investigating their accompanying complex networks. 
020       In this work, we investigate the fundamental topological and fractal properties of recurrence networks constructed from fractional Brownian motions (FBMs). First, our results indicate that the constructed recurrence networks have exponential degree distributions; the relationship between $H$ and $&lt;\lambda&gt;$ can be represented by a cubic polynomial function. We next focus on the motif rank distribution of recurrence networks, so that we can better understand networks at the local structure level. We find the interesting superfamily phenomenon, i.e. the recurrence networks with the same motif rank pattern being grouped into two superfamilies. Last, we numerically analyze the fractal and multifractal properties of recurrence networks. We find that the average fractal dimension $&lt;d_{B}&gt;$ of recurrence networks decreases with the Hurst index $H$ of the associated FBMs, and their dependence approximately satisfies the linear formula $&lt;d_{B}&gt; \approx 2 - H$. Moreover, our numerical results of multifractal analysis show that the multifractality exists in these recurrence networks, and the multifractality of these networks becomes stronger at first and then weaker when the Hurst index of the associated time series becomes larger from 0.4 to 0.95. In particular, the recurrence network with the Hurst index $H=0.5$ possess the strongest multifractality. In addition, the dependence relationships of the average information dimension $&lt;D(1)&gt;$ and the average correlation dimension $&lt;D(2)&gt;$ on the Hurst index $H$ can also be fitted well with linear functions. Our results strongly suggest that the recurrence network inherits the basic characteristic and the fractal nature of the associated FBM series.

010       Multifractal and complex network analyses of protein molecular dynamics
021       Based on protein molecular dynamics, we analyze fractal properties of energy, pressure and volume time series using the multifractal detrended fluctuations analysis (MF-DFA); and investigate the topological and multifractal properties of their visibility graph (complex network) representations. 
020       The energy terms of proteins we considered are bonded potential, angle potential, dihedral potential, improper potential, kinetic energy, Van der Waals potential, electrostatic potential, total energy and potential energy. Results of MF-DFA show that these time series are multifractal. The numerical values of the exponent $h(2)$ of MF-DFA which is related to Hurst exponent $H$ show that the series of total energy and potential energy are non-stationary and anti-persistent; other kinds of time series are stationary and persistent apart from series of pressure which has the weakest memorability with $H\approx 0.5$. Results of complex networks analysis based on visibility graph algorithm show that these visibility graphs are exponential. Our numerical results of multifractal analysis of the visibility graphs show that multifractality exists in these networks. We also found that after taking average over all proteins, there is a linear relationship between $&lt;h(2)&gt;$ (from MF-DFA on time series) and $&lt;D(0)&gt;$ of the constructed visibility graphs for different energy, pressure and volume.

010       Synergy and redundancy in the Granger causal analysis of dynamical   networks
021       We analyze by means of Granger causality the effect of synergy and redundancy in the inference (from time series data) of the information flow between subsystems of a complex network. 
020       Whilst we show that fully multivariate Granger causality is not affected by synergy, the pairwise analysis fails to put in evidence synergetic effects. <br />In cases when the number of samples is low, thus making the fully conditioned approach unfeasible, we show that partially conditioned Granger causality is an effective approach if the set of conditioning variables is properly chosen. We consider here these two different strategies (based either on informational content for the candidate driver or on pruning of the pairwise links) for partially conditioned Granger causality and show that depending on the data structure either one or the other might be equally valid. On the other hand, we observe that fully conditioned approaches do not work well in presence of redundancy, thus suggesting the strategy of separating the pairwise links in two subsets: those corresponding to indirect connections of the fully conditioned Granger causality (and thus needed to be eliminated) and those links elsewhere. These latter are ascribed to redundancy effects and must be given a further consideration. We finally apply these methods to two different datasets of real data. First, regarding epileptic electrophysiological data, we show that synergetic effects are dominant in the pre-ictal condition (just before seizure occurrences). Second, our analysis applied to genetic information from the HeLa culture showed that the underlying gene regulatory networks are characterized by both redundancy and synergy.

021       Low-dimensional behavior of large systems of globally coupled oscillators has been intensively investigated since the introduction of the Ott-Antonsen ansatz. 
020       In this report, we generalize the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to second-order Kuramoto models in complex networks. With an additional inertia term, we find a low-dimensional behavior similar to the first-order Kuramoto model, derive a self-consistent equation and seek the time-dependent derivation of the order parameter. Numerical simulations are also conducted to verify our analytical results.

010       Ground state energy of $q$-state Potts model: the minimum modularity
021       A wide range of interacting systems can be described by complex networks. 
020       A common feature of such networks is that they consist of several communities or modules, the degree of which may quantified as the \emph{modularity}. However, even a random uncorrelated network, which has no obvious modular structure, has a finite modularity due to the quenched disorder. For this reason, the modularity of a given network is meaningful only when it is compared with that of a randomized network with the same degree distribution. In this context, it is important to calculate the modularity of a random uncorrelated network with an arbitrary degree distribution. The modularity of a random network has been calculated [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{76}, 015102 (2007)]; however, this was limited to the case whereby the network was assumed to have only two communities, and it is evident that the modularity should be calculated in general with $q(\geq 2)$ communities. Here, we calculate the modularity for $q$ communities by evaluating the ground state energy of the $q$-state Potts Hamiltonian, based on replica symmetric solutions assuming that the mean degree is large. We found that the modularity is proportional to $\langle \sqrt{k} \rangle / \langle k \rangle$ regardless of $q$ and that only the coefficient depends on $q$. In particular, when the degree distribution follows a power law, the modularity is proportional to $\langle k \rangle^{-1/2}$. Our analytical results are confirmed by comparison with numerical simulations. Therefore, our results can be used as reference values for real-world networks.

010       Submodularity of Energy Related Controllability Metrics
021       The quantification of controllability and observability has recently received new interest in the context of large, complex networks of dynamical systems. 
020       A fundamental but computationally difficult problem is the placement or selection of actuators and sensors that optimize real-valued controllability and observability metrics of the network. We show that several classes of energy related metrics associated with the controllability Gramian in linear dynamical systems have a strong structural property, called submodularity. This property allows for an approximation guarantee by using a simple greedy heuristic for their maximization. The results are illustrated for randomly generated systems and for placement of power electronic actuators in a model of the European power grid.

010       Hub-activated signal transmission in complex networks
021       A wide range of networked systems exhibit highly connected nodes (hubs) as prominent structural elements. 
020       The functional roles of hubs in the collective nonlinear dynamics of many such networks, however, are not well understood. Here we propose that hubs in neural circuits may activate local signal transmission along sequences of specific subnetworks. Intriguingly, in contrast to previous suggestions of the functional roles of hubs, here not the hubs themselves, but non-hub subnetworks transfer the signals. The core mechanism relies on hubs and non-hubs providing activating feedback to each other. It may thus induce the propagation of specific pulse and rate signals in neuronal and other communication networks.

010       Multiple phase transitions of the susceptible-infected-susceptible   epidemic model on complex networks
021       We show that the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic dynamics running on the top of networks with a power law degree distribution can exhibit multiple phase transitions. 
020       Three main transitions involving different mechanisms responsible by sustaining the epidemics are identified: A short-term epidemics concentrated around the most connected vertex; a long-term (asymptotically stable) localized epidemics with a vanishing threshold; and an endemic phase occurring at a finite threshold. The different transitions are suited through different mean-field approaches. We finally show that the multiple transitions are due to the activations of different domains of the network that are observed in rapid (singular) variations of both stationary density of infected vertices and the participation ratio against the infection rate.

010       Fast Algorithm for Relaxation Processes in Big-data Systems
021       Relaxation processes driven by the Laplacian matrix in complex networks can be found in many real-world big-data systems, for example, search engines on web pages and dynamic load balancing protocols in mesh networks. 
020       To numerically implement such processes, a fast-running algorithm for the calculation of the inverse of the Laplacian matrix is needed. Yet, such algorithms have not been developed in complex networks, in which the fast-Fourier acceleration method cannot be used. Here, we introduce a fast-running algorithm that computes the pseudo inverse of a given Laplacian matrix using the renormalization method of the Gaussian integral. Through this method, the inverse of the Laplacian matrices of real-world networks containing millions of nodes can be obtained within reasonable computing times. Thus, this proposed algorithm could be used very widely in analyzing the relaxation processes occurring on large-scale networked systems.

As the most frequently used model for interacting agent-based systems, a brief description of the statistical mechanics of the classical Ising model on regular lattices, together with recent extensions of the same model on small-world Watts-Strogatz and scale-free Albert-Barabasi complex networks is included. Other sections of the chapter are devoted to applications of complex networks to economics, finance, spreading of innovations, and regional trade and developments. The chapter also reviews results involving applications of complex networks to other relevant socioeconomic issues, including results for opinion and citation networks. Finally, some avenues for future research are introduced before summarizing the main conclusions of the chapter.

010       Downlink Analysis for a Heterogeneous Cellular Network
021       In this paper, a comprehensive study of the the downlink performance in a heterogeneous cellular network (or hetnet) is conducted. 
020       A general hetnet model is considered consisting of an arbitrary number of open-access and closed-access tier of base stations (BSs) arranged according to independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. The BSs of each tier have a constant transmission power, random fading coefficient with an arbitrary distribution and arbitrary path-loss exponent of the power-law path-loss model. For such a system, analytical characterizations for the coverage probability and average rate at an arbitrary mobile-station (MS), and average per-tier load are derived for both the max-SINR connectivity and nearest-BS connectivity models. Using stochastic ordering, interesting properties and simplifications for the hetnet downlink performance are derived by relating these two connectivity models to the maximum instantaneous received power (MIRP) connectivity model and the maximum biased received power (MBRP) connectivity models, respectively, providing good insights about the hetnets and the downlink performance in these complex networks. Furthermore, the results also demonstrate the effectiveness and analytical tractability of the stochastic geometric approach to study the hetnet performance.

010       The Frustration effect on the explosive synchronization
021       This paper deals with the emergence of explosive synchronization in scale-free networks by considering the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. 
020       The natural frequencies of oscillators are assumed to be correlated with their degrees, and the frustration effect is included in the system. This assumption allows enhancing and delaying the explosive transition to reach a synchronous state, the desynchronization effect is found and the continuity of phase transition is changed. We provide an analytical treatment developed in a star graph, which reproduces results obtained in scale-free networks, a self consistant approach is proposed to explain desynchronization Our findings have important implications in controlling synchronization in complex networks since the frustration is a controllable parameter in experiment, and a discontinuous abrupt in engineering is always dangerous.

010       Modelling the Self-similarity in Complex Networks Based on Coulomb&#x27;s Law
021       Recently, self-similarity of complex networks have attracted much attention. 
020       Fractal dimension of complex network is an open issue. Hub repulsion plays an important role in fractal topologies. This paper models the repulsion among the nodes in the complex networks in calculation of the fractal dimension of the networks. The Coulomb's law is adopted to represent the repulse between two nodes of the network quantitatively. A new method to calculate the fractal dimension of complex networks is proposed. The Sierpinski triangle network and some real complex networks are investigated. The results are illustrated to show that the new model of self-similarity of complex networks is reasonable and efficient.

010       Gaussian Networks Generated by Random Walks
021       We propose a random walks based model to generate complex networks. 
020       Many authors studied and developed different methods and tools to analyze complex networks by random walk processes. Just to cite a few, random walks have been adopted to perform community detection, exploration tasks and to study temporal networks. Moreover, they have been used also to generate scale-free networks. In this work, we define a random walker that plays the role of "edges-generator". In particular, the random walker generates new connections and uses these ones to visit each node of a network. As result, the proposed model allows to achieve networks provided with a Gaussian degree distribution, and moreover, some features as the clustering coefficient and the assortativity show a critical behavior. Finally, we performed numerical simulations to study the behavior and the properties of the cited model.

010       Polish and English wordnets -- statistical analysis of interconnected   networks
021       Wordnets are semantic networks containing nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs organized according to linguistic principles, by means of semantic relations. 
020       In this work, we adopt a complex network perspective to perform a comparative analysis of the English and Polish wordnets. We determine their similarities and show that the networks exhibit some of the typical characteristics observed in other real-world networks. We analyse interlingual relations between both wordnets and deliberate over the problem of mapping the Polish lexicon onto the English one.

010       Synchronization in a stochastic Hebbian network of phase oscillators
021       We investigate a generalized Kuramoto phase-oscillator model with Hebb-like couplings that evolve according to a stochastic differential equation on various topologies. 
020       Numerical simulations show that even with identical oscillators, there is a regime in the nearest-neighbor coupling topologies and a complex network topology where oscillators move between an in phase and anti-phase state. Phase diagrams show the transition probabilities as a function of the noise strength and rate of evolution of network coupling. A minimal theoretical model allows us to understand these transitions.

010       Robustness surfaces of complex networks
021       Despite the robustness of complex networks has been under extensive study in the last decade, a unifying framework able to embrace all the proposed metrics is still lacking. 
020       There are two open issues related with this gap in the literature: (a) how to dimension several metrics to allow their summation and (b) how to weight each of the metrics. In this work we propose a solution for the two aforementioned problems by defining the $R^*$-value and introducing the concept of \emph{robustness surface} ($\Omega$). The rationale of our proposal is to make use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We firstly adjust to 1 the initial robustness of a network. Secondly, we find the most informative robustness metric under a specific failure scenario. Then, we repeat the process for several percentage of failures and combinatorial configurations. Lastly, we join these values to form the robustness surface, which allows the visual assessment of network robustness variability. Results show that a network presents different robustness surfaces (i.e., dissimilar shapes) depending on the failure scenario and the set of metrics. In addition, the robustness surface allows to compare the robustness of different networks.

010       A k-deformed Model of Growing Complex Networks with Fitness
021       The Barab\'asi-Bianconi (BB) fitness model can be solved by a mapping between the original network growth model to an idealized bosonic gas. 
020       The well-known transition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the emergence of "super-hubs" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation of the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we generalize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the nonextensive Kaniadakis k-distribution. Through numerical simulation and mean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not compromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the critical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the nonextensive parameter k.

010       The effect of fixing node strengths on multi-edge networks
021       Complex networks grow subject to structural constraints which affect their measurable properties. 
020       Assessing the effect that such constraints impose on their observables is thus a crucial aspect to be taken into account in their analysis. To this end,we examine the effect of fixing the strength sequence in multi-edge networks on several network observables such as degrees, disparity, average neighbor properties and weight distribution using an ensemble approach. We provide a general method to calculate any desired weighted network metric and we show that several features detected in real data could be explained solely by structural constraints. We thus justify the need of analytical null models to be used as basis to assess the relevance of features found in real data represented in weighted network form.

010       The role of centrality for the identification of influential spreaders   in complex networks
021       The identification of the most influential spreaders in networks is important to control and understand the spreading capabilities of the system as well as to ensure an efficient information diffusion such as in rumor-like dynamics. 
020       Recent works have suggested that the identification of influential spreaders is not independent of the dynamics being studied. For instance, the key disease spreaders might not necessarily be so when it comes to analyze social contagion or rumor propagation. Additionally, it has been shown that different metrics (degree, coreness, etc) might identify different influential nodes even for the same dynamical processes with diverse degree of accuracy. In this paper, we investigate how nine centrality measures correlate with the disease and rumor spreading capabilities of the nodes that made up different synthetic and real-world (both spatial and non-spatial) networks. We also propose a generalization of the random walk accessibility as a new centrality measure and derive analytical expressions for the latter measure for simple network configurations. Our results show that for non-spatial networks, the $k$-core and degree centralities are most correlated to epidemic spreading, whereas the average neighborhood degree, the closeness centrality and accessibility are most related to rumor dynamics. On the contrary, for spatial networks, the accessibility measure outperforms the rest of centrality metrics in almost all cases regardless of the kind of dynamics considered. Therefore, an important consequence of our analysis is that previous studies performed in synthetic random networks cannot be generalized to the case of spatial networks.

010       Collective computation in a network with distributed information
021       We analyze a distributed information network in which each node has access to the information contained in a limited set of nodes (its neighborhood) at a given time. 
020       A collective computation is carried out in which each node calculates a value that implies all information contained in the network (in our case, the average value of a variable that can take different values in each network node). The neighborhoods can change dynamically by exchanging neighbors with other nodes. The results of this collective calculation show rapid convergence and good scalability with the network size. These results are compared with those of a fixed network arranged as a square lattice, in which the number of rounds to achieve a given accuracy is very high when the size of the network increases. The results for the evolving networks are interpreted in light of the properties of complex networks and are directly relevant to the diameter and characteristic path length of the networks, which seem to express "small world" properties.

010       Resilience of modular complex networks
021       Complex networks often have a modular structure, where a number of tightly- connected groups of nodes (modules) have relatively few interconnections. 
020       Modularity had been shown to have an important effect on the evolution and stability of biological networks, on the scalability and efficiency of large-scale infrastructure, and the development of economic and social systems. An analytical framework for understanding modularity and its effects on network vulnerability is still missing. Through recent advances in the understanding of multilayer networks, however, it is now possible to develop a theoretical framework to systematically study this critical issue. Here we study, analytically and numerically, the resilience of modular networks under attacks on interconnected nodes, which exhibit high betweenness values and are often more exposed to failure. Our model provides new understandings into the feedback between structure and function in real world systems, and consequently has important implications as diverse as developing efficient immunization strategies, designing robust large-scale infrastructure, and understanding brain function.

010       Parallel Graph Partitioning for Complex Networks
021       Processing large complex networks like social networks or web graphs has recently attracted considerable interest. 
020       In order to do this in parallel, we need to partition them into pieces of about equal size. Unfortunately, previous parallel graph partitioners originally developed for more regular mesh-like networks do not work well for these networks. This paper addresses this problem by parallelizing and adapting the label propagation technique originally developed for graph clustering. By introducing size constraints, label propagation becomes applicable for both the coarsening and the refinement phase of multilevel graph partitioning. We obtain very high quality by applying a highly parallel evolutionary algorithm to the coarsened graph. The resulting system is both more scalable and achieves higher quality than state-of-the-art systems like ParMetis or PT-Scotch. For large complex networks the performance differences are very big. For example, our algorithm can partition a web graph with 3.3 billion edges in less than sixteen seconds using 512 cores of a high performance cluster while producing a high quality partition -- none of the competing systems can handle this graph on our system.

010       (Semi-)External Algorithms for Graph Partitioning and Clustering
021       In this paper, we develop semi-external and external memory algorithms for graph partitioning and clustering problems. 
020       Graph partitioning and clustering are key tools for processing and analyzing large complex networks. We address both problems in the (semi-)external model by adapting the size-constrained label propagation technique. Our (semi-)external size-constrained label propagation algorithm can be used to compute graph clusterings and is a prerequisite for the (semi-)external graph partitioning algorithm. The algorithm is then used for both the coarsening and the refinement phase of a multilevel algorithm to compute graph partitions. Our algorithm is able to partition and cluster huge complex networks with billions of edges on cheap commodity machines. Experiments demonstrate that the semi-external graph partitioning algorithm can compute high quality partitions in time no more than a factor 4 of an efficient internal memory implementation.

010       The Rise of China in the International Trade Network: A Community Core   Detection Approach
021       Theory of complex networks proved successful in the description of a variety of static networks ranging from biology to computer and social sciences and to economics and finance. 
020       Here we use network models to describe the evolution of a particular economic system, namely the International Trade Network (ITN). Previous studies often assume that globalization and regionalization in international trade are contradictory to each other. We re-examine the relationship between globalization and regionalization by viewing the international trade system as an interdependent complex network. We use the modularity optimization method to detect communities and community cores in the ITN during the years 1995-2011. We find rich dynamics over time both inter- and intra-communities. Most importantly, we have a multilevel description of the evolution where the global dynamics (i.e., communities disappear or reemerge) tend to be correlated with the regional dynamics (i.e., community core changes between community members). In particular, the Asia-Oceania community disappeared and reemerged over time along with a switch in leadership from Japan to China. Moreover, simulation results show that the global dynamics can be generated by a preferential attachment mechanism both inter- and intra-communities.

010       On Submodularity and Controllability in Complex Dynamical Networks
021       Controllability and observability have long been recognized as fundamental structural properties of dynamical systems, but have recently seen renewed interest in the context of large, complex networks of dynamical systems. 
020       A basic problem is sensor and actuator placement: choose a subset from a finite set of possible placements to optimize some real-valued controllability and observability metrics of the network. Surprisingly little is known about the structure of such combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we show that several important classes of metrics based on the controllability and observability Gramians have a strong structural property that allows for either efficient global optimization or an approximation guarantee by using a simple greedy heuristic for their maximization. In particular, the mapping from possible placements to several scalar functions of the associated Gramian is either a modular or submodular set function. The results are illustrated on randomly generated systems and on a problem of power electronic actuator placement in a model of the European power grid.

010       Epidemic and Cascading Survivability of Complex Networks
021       Our society nowadays is governed by complex networks, examples being the power grids, telecommunication networks, biological networks, and social networks. 
020       It has become of paramount importance to understand and characterize the dynamic events (e.g. failures) that might happen in these complex networks. For this reason, in this paper, we propose two measures to evaluate the vulnerability of complex networks in two different dynamic multiple failure scenarios: epidemic-like and cascading failures. Firstly, we present \emph{epidemic survivability} ($ES$), a new network measure that describes the vulnerability of each node of a network under a specific epidemic intensity. Secondly, we propose \emph{cascading survivability} ($CS$), which characterizes how potentially injurious a node is according to a cascading failure scenario. Then, we show that by using the distribution of values obtained from $ES$ and $CS$ it is possible to describe the vulnerability of a given network. We consider a set of 17 different complex networks to illustrate the suitability of our proposals. Lastly, results reveal that distinct types of complex networks might react differently under the same multiple failure scenario.

010       Turing instability in Reaction-Diffusion models on complex networks
021       In this paper, the Turing instability in reaction-diffusion models defined on complex networks is studied. 
020       Here, we focus on three types of models which generate complex networks, i.e. the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz and the threshold network models. From analysis of the Laplacian matrices of graphs generated by these models, we reveal that the stable-unstable regions of a spatially homogeneous solution completely differ, depending on network structures. In particular, we approximately argue the existence of the stable-unstable regions in the cases of regular enhanced ring lattices which include regular circles, and networks generated by the threshold network model when the number of vertices is large enough.

010       Fence-sitters Protect Cooperation in Complex Networks
021       Evolutionary game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific disciplines from science to engineering. 
020       In complex networks, because of the difficulty of formulating the replicator dynamics, most of previous studies are confined to a numerical level. In this paper, we introduce a vectorial formulation to derive three classes of individuals' payoff analytically. The three classes are pure cooperators, pure defectors, and fence-sitters. Here, fence-sitters are the individuals who change their strategies at least once in the strategy evolutionary process. As a general approach, our vectorial formalization can be applied to all the two-strategies games. To clarify the function of the fence-sitters, we define a parameter, payoff memory, as the number of rounds that the individuals' payoffs are aggregated. We observe that the payoff memory can control the fence-sitters' effects and the level of cooperation efficiently. Our results indicate that the fence-sitters' role is nontrivial in the complex topologies, which protects cooperation in an indirect way. Our results may provide a better understanding of the composition of cooperators in a circumstance where the temptation to defect is larger.

010       Emergence of Cooperation in Non-scale-free Networks
021       Evolutionary game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific disciplines from science to engineering. 
020       Previous studies proposed a strategy updating mechanism, which successfully demonstrated that the scale-free network can provide a framework for the emergence of cooperation. Instead, individuals in random graphs and small-world networks do not favor cooperation under this updating rule. However, a recent empirical result shows the heterogeneous networks do not promote cooperation when humans play a Prisoner's Dilemma. In this paper, we propose a strategy updating rule with payoff memory. We observe that the random graphs and small-world networks can provide even better frameworks for cooperation than the scale-free networks in this scenario. Our observations suggest that the degree heterogeneity may be neither a sufficient condition nor a necessary condition for the widespread cooperation in complex networks. Also, the topological structures are not sufficed to determine the level of cooperation in complex networks.

010       Generalized friendship paradox in networks with tunable degree-attribute   correlation
021       One of interesting phenomena due to topological heterogeneities in complex networks is the friendship paradox: Your friends have on average more friends than you do. 
020       Recently, this paradox has been generalized for arbitrary node attributes, called generalized friendship paradox (GFP). The origin of GFP at the network level has been shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degrees and attributes. However, how the GFP holds for individual nodes needs to be understood in more detail. For this, we first analyze a solvable model to characterize the paradox holding probability of nodes for the uncorrelated case. Then we numerically study the correlated model of networks with tunable degree-degree and degree-attribute correlations. In contrast to the network level, we find at the individual level that the relevance of degree-attribute correlation to the paradox holding probability may depend on whether the network is assortative or dissortative. These findings help us to understand the interplay between topological structure and node attributes in complex networks.

010       k-Core percolation on multiplex networks
021       We generalize the theory of k-core percolation on complex networks to k-core percolation on multiplex networks, where k=(k_a, k_b, ...). 
020       Multiplex networks can be defined as networks with a set of vertices but different types of edges, a, b, ..., representing different types of interactions. For such networks, the k-core is defined as the largest sub-graph in which each vertex has at least k_i edges of each type, i = a, b, ... . We derive self-consistency equations to obtain the birth points of the k-cores and their relative sizes for uncorrelated multiplex networks with an arbitrary degree distribution. To clarify our general results, we consider in detail multiplex networks with edges of two types, a and b, and solve the equations in the particular case of ER and scale-free multiplex networks. We find hybrid phase transitions at the emergence points of k-cores except the (1,1)-core for which the transition is continuous. We apply the k-core decomposition algorithm to air-transportation multiplex networks, composed of two layers, and obtain the size of (k_a, k_b)-cores.

010       General analytical solutions for DC/AC circuit network analysis
021       In this work, we present novel general analytical solutions for the currents that are developed in the edges of network-like circuits when some nodes of the network act as sources/sinks of DC or AC current. 
020       We assume that Ohm's law is valid at every edge and that charge at every node is conserved (with the exception of the source/sink nodes). The resistive, capacitive, and/or inductive properties of the lines in the circuit define a complex network structure with given impedances for each edge. Our solution for the currents at each edge is derived in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the network defined from the impedances. This derivation also allows us to compute the equivalent impedance between any two nodes of the circuit and relate it to currents in a closed circuit which has a single voltage generator instead of many input/output source/sink nodes. Contrary to solving Kirchhoff's equations, our derivation allows to easily calculate the redistribution of currents that occurs when the location of sources and sinks changes within the network. Finally, we show that our solutions are identical to the ones found from Circuit Theory node analysis.

010       Dynamic Behavior of Interacting between Epidemics and Cascades on   Heterogeneous Networks
021       Epidemic spreading and cascading failure are two important dynamical processes over complex networks. 
020       They have been investigated separately for a long history. But in the real world, these two dynamics sometimes may interact with each other. In this paper, we explore a model combined with SIR epidemic spreading model and local loads sharing cascading failure model. There exists a critical value of tolerance parameter that whether the epidemic with high infection probability can spread out and infect a fraction of the network in this model. When the tolerance parameter is smaller than the critical value, cascading failure cuts off abundant of paths and blocks the spreading of epidemic locally. While the tolerance parameter is larger than the critical value, epidemic spreads out and infects a fraction of the network. A method for estimating the critical value is proposed. In simulation, we verify the effectiveness of this method in Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) networks.

010       Complex Networks Measures for Differentiation between Normal and   Shuffled Croatian Texts
021       This paper studies the properties of the Croatian texts via complex networks. 
020       We present network properties of normal and shuffled Croatian texts for different shuffling principles: on the sentence level and on the text level. In both experiments we preserved the vocabulary size, word and sentence frequency distributions. Additionally, in the first shuffling approach we preserved the sentence structure of the text and the number of words per sentence. Obtained results showed that degree rank distributions exhibit no substantial deviation in shuffled networks, and strength rank distributions are preserved due to the same word frequencies. Therefore, standard approach to study the structure of linguistic co-occurrence networks showed no clear difference among the topologies of normal and shuffled texts. Finally, we showed that the in- and out- selectivity values from shuffled texts are constantly below selectivity values calculated from normal texts. Our results corroborate that the node selectivity measure can capture structural differences between original and shuffled Croatian texts.

010       Analysis of the hierarchical structure of the B. subtilis   transcriptional regulatory network
021       The transcriptional regulation of gene expression is orchestrated by complex networks of interacting genes. 
020       Increasing evidence indicates that these transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) in bacteria have an inherently hierarchical architecture, although the design principles and the specific advantages offered by this type of organization have not yet been fully elucidated. In this study, we focussed on the hierarchical structure of the TRN of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and performed a comparative analysis with the TRN of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we organized the transcription factors (TFs) and sigma-factors in the TRNs of B. subtilis and E. coli into three hierarchical levels (Top, Middle and Bottom) and studied several structural and functional properties across them. In addition to many similarities, we found also specific differences, explaining the majority of them with variations in the distribution of sigma-factors across the hierarchical levels in the two organisms. We then investigated the control of target metabolic genes by transcriptional regulators to characterize the differential regulation of three distinct metabolic subsystems (catabolism, anabolism and central energy metabolism). These results suggest that the hierarchical architecture that we observed in B. subtilis represents an effective organization of its TRN to achieve flexibility in the response to diverse stimuli.

010       A preliminary study of Croatian Language Syllable Networks
021       This paper presents preliminary results of Croatian syllable networks analysis. 
020       Syllable network is a network in which nodes are syllables and links between them are constructed according to their connections within words. In this paper we analyze networks of syllables generated from texts collected from the Croatian Wikipedia and Blogs. As a main tool we use complex network analysis methods which provide mechanisms that can reveal new patterns in a language structure. We aim to show that syllable networks have much higher clustering coefficient in comparison to Erd\"os-Renyi random networks. The results indicate that Croatian syllable networks exhibit certain properties of a small world networks. Furthermore, we compared Croatian syllable networks with Portuguese and Chinese syllable networks and we showed that they have similar properties.

010       Networks of superconducting nano-puddles in 1/8 doped YBa2Cu3O6.5+y   controlled by thermal manipulation
021       While it is known that the nature and the arrangement of defects in complex oxides have an impact on the material functionalities little is known on control of superconductivity by oxygen interstitial organization in cuprates. 
020       Here we report direct compelling evidence for the control of Tc, by manipulation of the superconducting granular networks of nanoscale puddles, made of ordered oxygen stripes, in a single crystal of YBa2Cu3O6.5+y with average formal hole doping p close to 1/8. Upon thermal treatments we were able to switch from a first network of oxygen defects striped puddles with OVIII modulation (qOVIII(a*)=(h+3/8,k,0) and qOVIII(a*)=(h+5/8,k,0)), to second network characterized by OXVI modulation (qOXVI(a*)=(h+7/16,k,0) and qOXVI(a*)=(h+9/16,k,0)), and finally to a third network with puddles of OV periodicity (qOV(a*)=(4/10,1,0) and qOV(a*)=(6/10,1,0)). We map the microscopic spatial evolution of the out of plane OVIII, OXVI and OV puddles nano-size distribution via scanning micro-diffraction measurements. In particular, we calculated the number of oxygen chains (n) and the charge density (holes concentration p) inside each puddle, analyzing areas of 160x80 {\mu}m2, and recording 12800 diffraction patterns to reconstruct each spatial map. The high spatial inhomogeneity shown by all the reconstructed spatial maps reflects the intrinsic granular structure that characterizes cuprates and iron-chalcogenides, disclosing the presence of several complex networks of coexisting superconducting domains with different lattice modulations, charge density and different gaps like in the proposed multi-gaps scenario called superstripes.

021       Topological properties of networks are widely applied to study the link-prediction problem recently. 
020       Common Neighbors, for example, is a natural yet efficient framework. Many variants of Common Neighbors have been thus proposed to further boost the discriminative resolution of candidate links. In this paper, we reexamine the role of network topology in predicting missing links from the perspective of information theory, and present a practical approach based on the mutual information of network structures. It not only can improve the prediction accuracy substantially, but also experiences reasonable computing complexity.

010       Competing spreading processes on multiplex networks: awareness and   epidemics
021       Epidemic-like spreading processes on top of multilayered interconnected complex networks reveal a rich phase diagram of intertwined competition effects. 
020       A recent study by the authors [Granell et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 128701 (2013)] presented the analysis of the interrelation between two processes accounting for the spreading of an epidemics, and the spreading of information awareness to prevent its infection, on top of multiplex networks. The results in the case in which awareness implies total immunization to the disease, revealed the existence of a metacritical point at which the critical onset of the epidemics starts depending on the reaching of the awareness process. Here we present a full analysis of these critical properties in the more general scenario where the awareness spreading does not imply total immunization, and where infection does not imply immediate awareness of it. We find the critical relation between both competing processes for a wide spectrum of parameters representing the interaction between them. We also analyze the consequences of a massive broadcast of awareness (mass media) on the final outcome of the epidemic incidence. Importantly enough, the mass media makes the metacritical point to disappear. The results reveal that the main finding i.e. existence of a metacritical point, is rooted on the competition principle and holds for a large set of scenarios.

010       Competitive Dynamics on Complex Networks
021       We consider a dynamical network model in which two competitors have fixed and different states, and each normal agent adjusts its state according to a distributed consensus protocol. 
020       The state of each normal agent converges to a steady value which is a convex combination of the competitors' states, and is independent of the initial states of agents. This implies that the competition result is fully determined by the network structure and positions of competitors in the network. We compute an Influence Matrix (IM) in which each element characterizing the influence of an agent on another agent in the network. We use the IM to predict the bias of each normal agent and thus predict which competitor will win. Furthermore, we compare the IM criterion with seven node centrality measures to predict the winner. We find that the competitor with higher Katz Centrality in an undirected network or higher PageRank in a directed network is much more likely to be the winner. These findings may shed new light on the role of network structure in competition and to what extent could competitors adjust network structure so as to win the competition.

010       Design of Efficient Sampling Methods on Hybrid Social-Affiliation   Networks
021       Graph sampling via crawling has become increasingly popular and important in the study of measuring various characteristics of large scale complex networks. 
020       While powerful, it is known to be challenging when the graph is loosely connected or disconnected which slows down the convergence of random walks and can cause poor estimation accuracy. <br />In this work, we observe that the graph under study, or called target graph, usually does not exist in isolation. In many situations, the target graph is related to an auxiliary graph and an affiliation graph, and the target graph becomes well connected when we view it from the perspective of these three graphs together, or called a hybrid social-affiliation graph in this paper. When directly sampling the target graph is difficult or inefficient, we can indirectly sample it efficiently with the assistances of the other two graphs. We design three sampling methods on such a hybrid social-affiliation network. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

010       Towards Cost-efficient Sampling Methods
021       The sampling method has been paid much attention in the field of complex network in general and statistical physics in particular. 
020       This paper presents two new sampling methods based on the perspective that a small part of vertices with high node degree can possess the most structure information of a network. The two proposed sampling methods are efficient in sampling the nodes with high degree. The first new sampling method is improved on the basis of the stratified random sampling method and selects the high degree nodes with higher probability by classifying the nodes according to their degree distribution. The second sampling method improves the existing snowball sampling method so that it enables to sample the targeted nodes selectively in every sampling step. Besides, the two proposed sampling methods not only sample the nodes but also pick the edges directly connected to these nodes. In order to demonstrate the two methods' availability and accuracy, we compare them with the existing sampling methods in three commonly used simulation networks that are scale-free network, random network, small-world network, and two real networks. The experimental results show that the two proposed sampling methods perform much better than the compared existing sampling methods in terms of sampling cost and obtaining the true network structural characteristics.

020       We construct three different directed networks of increasing complexity, defining nodes as local patterns on plaquettes of increasing sizes, and links as actual successions of these patterns in databases of real games. We discuss the peculiarities of these networks compared to other types of networks. We explore the ranking vectors and community structure of the networks and show that this approach enables to extract groups of moves with common strategic properties. We also investigate different networks built from games with players of different levels or from different phases of the game. We discuss how the study of the community structure of these networks may help to improve the computer simulations of the game. More generally, we believe such studies may help to improve the understanding of human decision process.

010       A Measurement Framework for Directed Networks
021       Partially-observed network data collected by link-tracing based sampling methods is often being studied to obtain the characteristics of a large complex network. 
020       However, little attention has been paid to sampling from directed networks such as WWW and Peer-to-Peer networks. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step (sampling/estimation) framework to measure nodal characteristics which can be defined by an average target function in an arbitrary directed network. To this end, we propose a personalized PageRank-based algorithm to visit and sample nodes. This algorithm only uses already visited nodes as local information without any prior knowledge about the latent structure of the network. Moreover, we introduce a new estimator based on the approximate importance sampling to estimate average target functions. The proposed estimator utilizes calculated PageRank value of each sampled node as an approximation for the exact visiting probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on correcting the bias of a sampling method by re-weighting of measured values that considers the effect of approximation of visiting probabilities. Comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the estimator demonstrate that it is asymptotically unbiased even in situations where stationary distribution of PageRank is poorly approximated.

010       Longest-path attacks on complex networks
021       We investigate the longest-path attacks on complex networks. 
020       Specifically, we remove approximately the longest simple path from a network iteratively until there are no paths left in the network. We propose two algorithms, the random augmenting approach (RPA) and the Hamilton-path based approach (HPA), for finding the approximately longest simple path in a network. Results demonstrate that steps of longest-path attacks increase with network density linearly for random networks, while exponentially increasing for scale-free networks. The more homogeneous the degree distribution is, the more fragile the network, which is totally different from the previous results of node or edge attacks. HPA is generally more efficient than RPA in the longest-path attacks of complex networks. These findings further help us understand the vulnerability of complex systems, better protect complex systems, and design more tolerant complex systems.

010       Analyzing complex networks through correlations in centrality   measurements
021       Many real world systems can be expressed as complex networks of interconnected nodes. 
020       It is frequently important to be able to quantify the relative importance of the various nodes in the network, a task accomplished by defining some centrality measures, with different centrality definitions stressing different aspects of the network. It is interesting to know to what extent these different centrality definitions are related for different networks. In this work, we study the correlation between pairs of a set of centrality measures for different real world networks and two network models. We show that the centralities are in general correlated, but with stronger correlations for network models than for real networks. We also show that the strength of the correlation of each pair of centralities varies from network to network. Taking this fact into account, we propose the use of a centrality correlation profile, consisting of the values of the correlation coefficients between all pairs of centralities of interest, as a way to characterize networks. Using the yeast protein interaction network as an example we show also that the centrality correlation profile can be used to assess the adequacy of a network model as a representation of a given real network.

010       Entropic determination of the phase transition in a coevolving   opinion-formation model
021       We study an opinion formation model by the means of a co-evolving complex network where the vertices represent the individuals, characterised by their evolving opinions, and the edges represent the interactions among them. 
020       The network adapts to the spreading of opinions in two ways: not only connected agents interact and eventually change their thinking but an agent may also rewire one of its links to a neighborhood holding the same opinion as his. The dynamics depends on an external parameter {\Phi}, which controls the plasticity of the network. We show how the information entropy associated to the distribution of group sizes, allows to locate the phase transition between full consensus and a society where different opinions coexist. We also determine the minimum size of the most informative sampling. At the transition the distribution of the sizes of groups holding the same opinion is scale free.

010       An improved vulnerability index of complex networks based on fractal   dimension
021       With an increasing emphasis on network security, much more attention has been attracted to the vulnerability of complex networks. 
020       The multi-scale evaluation of vulnerability is widely used since it makes use of combined powers of the links' betweenness and has an effective evaluation to vulnerability. However, how to determine the coefficient in existing multi-scale evaluation model to measure the vulnerability of different networks is still an open issue. In this paper, an improved model based on the fractal dimension of complex networks is proposed to obtain a more reasonable evaluation of vulnerability with more physical significance. Not only the structure and basic physical properties of networks is characterized, but also the covering ability of networks, which is related to the vulnerability of the network, is taken into consideration in our proposed method. The numerical examples and real applications are used to illustrate the efficiency of our proposed method.

Yet previous work addressing the impacts of partial network data is surprisingly limited, focuses primarily on missing nodes, and suggests that network statistics derived from subsampled data are not suitable estimators for the same network statistics describing the overall network topology. Our aim here is to generate scaling methods to predict true network statistics from only partial knowledge of nodes, links, or weights. We validate analytical results on four simulated network classes and empirical data sets of various sizes. We perform subsampling experiments by varying proportions of sampled data and demonstrate that our scaling methods can provide very good estimates of true network statistics while acknowledging limits. Lastly, we apply our techniques to a set of rich and evolving large-scale social networks, Twitter reply networks. Based on 100 million tweets, we use our scaling techniques to propose a statistical characterization of the Twitter Interactome from September 2008 to February 2009. Our treatment allows us to find support for Dunbar's hypothesis in detecting an upper threshold for the number of active social contacts that individuals maintain over the course of one week.

010       Tsallis information dimension of complex networks
021       The fractal and self-similarity properties are revealed in many complex networks. 
020       In order to show the influence of different part in the complex networks to the information dimension, we have proposed a new information dimension based on Tsallis entropy namely Tsallis information dimension. The Tsallis information dimension can show the fractal property from different perspective by set different value of q.

010       Local degree blocking model for missing link prediction in complex   networks
021       Recovering and reconstructing incomplete networks by accurately identifying missing links is a vital task in the domain of network analysis and mining. 
020       In this article, by studying a specific local structure, namely a degree block having a node and its all immediate neighbors, we find it contains important statistical features of link formation in complex networks. We therefore propose a local blocking (LB) predictor to quantitatively identify missing links in given networks via local link density calculations. The promising experimental results performed on six real-world networks suggest that the new index can substantially outperform other traditional local similarity-based methods. After further analyzing the correlations between the LB scores and those given by two other methods, we find that the features of LB index are analogous to those of both PA index and short path based index, which empirically verify that the two aspects simultaneously captured by the LB index are jointly driving link formation in complex networks.

010       Efficiency of message transmission using biased random walks in complex   networks in the presence of traps
021       We study the problem of a particle/message that travels as a biased random walk towards a target node in a network in the presence of traps. 
020       The bias is represented as the probability $p$ of the particle to travel along the shortest path to the target node. The efficiency of the transmission process is expressed through the fraction $f_g$ of particles that succeed to reach the target without being trapped. By relating $f_g$ with the number $S$ of nodes visited before reaching the target, we firstly show that, for the unbiased random walk, $f_g$ is inversely proportional to both the concentration $c$ of traps and the size $N$ of the network. For the case of biased walks, a simple approximation of $S$ provides an analytical solution that describes well the behavior of $f_g$, especially for $p&gt;0.5$. Also, it is shown that for a given value of the bias $p$, when the concentration of traps is less than a threshold value equal to the inverse of the Mean First Passage Time (MFPT) between two randomly chosen nodes of the network, the efficiency of transmission is unaffected by the presence of traps and almost all the particles arrive at the target. As a consequence, for a given concentration of traps, we can estimate the minimum bias that is needed to have unaffected transmission, especially in the case of Random Regular (RR), Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks, where an exact expression (RR and ER) or an upper bound (SF) of the MFPT is known analytically. We also study analytically and numerically, the fraction $f_g$ of particles that reach the target on SF networks, where a single trap is placed on the highest degree node. For the unbiased random walk, we find that $f_g \sim N^{-1/(\gamma-1)}$, where $\gamma$ is the power law exponent of the SF network.

010       A Generalized and Adaptive Method for Community Detection
021       Complex networks represent interactions between entities. 
020       They appear in various contexts such as sociology, biology, etc., and they generally contain highly connected subgroups called communities. Community detection is a well-studied problem and most of the algorithms aim to maximize the Newman-Girvan modularity function, the most popular being the Louvain method (it is well-suited on very large graphs). However, the classical modularity has many drawbacks: we can find partitions of high quality in graphs without community structure, e.g., on random graphs; it promotes large communities. Then, we have adapted the Louvain method to other quality functions. In this paper, we describe a generic version of the Louvain method. In particular, we give a sufficient condition to plug a quality function into it. We also show that global performance of this new version is similar to the classical Louvain algorithm, that promotes it to the best rank of the community detection algorithms.

010       A Flexible Fitness Function for Community Detection in Complex Networks
021       Most community detection algorithms from the literature work as optimization tools that minimize a given \textit{fitness function}, while assuming that each node belongs to a single community. 
020       Since there is no hard concept of what a community is, most proposed fitness functions focus on a particular definition. As such, these functions do not always lead to partitions that correspond to those observed in practice. This paper proposes a new flexible fitness function that allows the identification of communities with distinct characteristics. Such flexibility was evaluated through the adoption of an immune-inspired optimization algorithm, named cob-aiNet[C], to identify both disjoint and overlapping communities in a set of benchmark networks. The results have shown that the obtained partitions are much closer to the ground-truth than those obtained by the optimization of the modularity function.

020       Then we develop new network analysis algorithms that exploit this bounded-expansion structure: fast induced-subgraph and homomorphism counting, and fast computation of several centrality measures in all neighborhoods of constant radius. Together, these results show the power of structural graph theory and algorithms for analyzing and understanding complex/social networks.

010       Synchronization-Desynchronization Transitions in Complex Networks: An   Interplay of Distributed Time Delay and Inhibitory Nodes
021       We investigate the combined effects of distributed delay and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory nodes on the stability of synchronous oscillations in a network of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. 
020       To this end a network model is proposed for which the stability can be investigated analytically. It is found that beyond a critical inhibition ratio synchronization tends to be unstable. However, increasing distributional widths can counteract this trend leading to multiple resynchronization transitions at relatively high inhibition ratios. All studies are performed on two distribution types, a uniform distribution and a Gamma distribution.

010       Mean first-passage time for maximal-entropy random walks in complex   networks
021       We perform an in-depth study for mean first-passage time (MFPT)---a primary quantity for random walks with numerous applications---of maximal-entropy random walks (MERW) performed in complex networks. 
020       For MERW in a general network, we derive an explicit expression of MFPT in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix associated with the network. For MERW in uncorrelated networks, we also provide a theoretical formula of MFPT at the mean-field level, based on which we further evaluate the dominant scalings of MFPT to different targets for MERW in uncorrelated scale-free networks, and compare the results with those corresponding to traditional unbiased random walks (TURW). We show that the MFPT to a hub node is much lower for MERW than for TURW. However, when the destination is a node with the least degree or a uniformly chosen node, the MFPT is higher for MERW than for TURW. Since MFPT to a uniformly chosen node measures real efficiency of search in networks, our work provides insight into general searching process in complex networks.

010       Functional brain networks: great expectations, hard times, and the big   leap forward
021       Many physical and biological systems can be studied using complex network theory, a new statistical physics understanding of graph theory. 
020       The recent application of complex network theory to the study of functional brain networks generated great enthusiasm as it allows addressing hitherto non-standard issues in the field, such as efficiency of brain functioning or vulnerability to damage. However, in spite of its high degree of generality, the theory was originally designed to describe systems profoundly different from the brain. We discuss some important caveats in the wholesale application of existing tools and concepts to a field they were not originally designed to describe. At the same time, we argue that complex network theory has not yet been taken full advantage of, as many of its important aspects are yet to make their appearance in the neuroscience literature. Finally, we propose that, rather than simply borrowing from an existing theory, functional neural networks can inspire a fundamental reformulation of complex network theory, to account for its exquisitely complex functioning mode.

010       Extracting information from S-curves of language change
021       It is well accepted that adoption of innovations are described by S-curves (slow start, accelerating period, and slow end). 
020       In this paper, we analyze how much information on the dynamics of innovation spreading can be obtained from a quantitative description of S-curves. We focus on the adoption of linguistic innovations for which detailed databases of written texts from the last 200 years allow for an unprecedent statistical precision. Combining data analysis with simulations of simple models (e.g., the Bass dynamics on complex networks) we identify signatures of endogenous and exogenous factors in the adoption curves. We propose a measure to quantify the strength of these factors and three different methods to estimate it from S-curves. We obtain cases in which the exogenous factors are dominant (in the adoption of German orthographic reforms and of one irregular verb) and cases in which endogenous factors are dominant (in the adoption of conventions for romanization of Russian names and in the regularization of most studied verbs). These results show that the shape of S-curve is not universal and contains information on the adoption mechanism.

010       Uncovering Randomness and Success in Society
021       An understanding of how individuals shape and impact the evolution of society is vastly limited due to the unavailability of large-scale reliable datasets that can simultaneously capture information regarding individual movements and social interactions. 
020       We believe that the popular Indian film industry, 'Bollywood', can provide a social network apt for such a study. Bollywood provides massive amounts of real, unbiased data that spans more than 100 years, and hence this network has been used as a model for the present paper. The nodes which maintain a moderate degree or widely cooperate with the other nodes of the network tend to be more fit (measured as the success of the node in the industry) in comparison to the other nodes. The analysis carried forth in the current work, using a conjoined framework of complex network theory and random matrix theory, aims to quantify the elements that determine the fitness of an individual node and the factors that contribute to the robustness of a network. The authors of this paper believe that the method of study used in the current paper can be extended to study various other industries and organizations.

We demonstrate that the refinement of network construction together with the study of prevalence of different motifs allows a full explosion of the evolving period doubling cascade route to chaos in both discrete and continuous dynamical systems. Further, this links the phase space time series topologies to the corresponding network topologies, and thus helps to understand the empirical "superfamily" phenomenon, as shown by Xu.

010       Modeling and Measuring Graph Similarity: The Case for Centrality   Distance
021       The study of the topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for several decades, and today we have a fairly good understanding of the types and reoccurring characteristics of many different complex networks. 
020       However, surprisingly little is known today about models to compare complex graphs, and quantitatively measure their similarity. This paper proposes a natural similarity measure for complex networks: centrality distance, the difference between two graphs with respect to a given node centrality. Centrality distances allow to take into account the specific roles of the different nodes in the network, and have many interesting applications. As a case study, we consider the closeness centrality in more detail, and show that closeness centrality distance can be used to effectively distinguish between randomly generated and actual evolutionary paths of two dynamic social networks.

010       Parallel Algorithms for Counting Triangles in Networks with Large   Degrees
021       Finding the number of triangles in a network is an important problem in the analysis of complex networks. 
020       The number of triangles also has important applications in data mining. Existing distributed memory parallel algorithms for counting triangles are either Map-Reduce based or message passing interface (MPI) based and work with overlapping partitions of the given network. These algorithms are designed for very sparse networks and do not work well when the degrees of the nodes are relatively larger. For networks with larger degrees, Map-Reduce based algorithm generates prohibitively large intermediate data, and in MPI based algorithms with overlapping partitions, each partition can grow as large as the original network, wiping out the benefit of partitioning the network. <br />In this paper, we present two efficient MPI-based parallel algorithms for counting triangles in massive networks with large degrees. The first algorithm is a space-efficient algorithm for networks that do not fit in the main memory of a single compute node. This algorithm divides the network into non-overlapping partitions. The second algorithm is for the case where the main memory of each node is large enough to contain the entire network. We observe that for such a case, computation load can be balanced dynamically and present a dynamic load balancing scheme which improves the performance significantly. Both of our algorithms scale well to large networks and to a large number of processors.

020       First, we analytically calculate the critical exponent {\nu} and the connective constant by a renormalization-group analysis in arbitrary fractal dimensions. We find that the exponent {\nu} is equal to the displacement exponent, which describes the speed of diffusion in terms of the shortest distance. Second, by obtaining an exact solution for the (u,u)-flower, we provide an example which supports the conjecture that the universality class of the self-avoiding walk on graphs is not determined only by the fractal dimension.

010       A Method for Characterizing Communities in Dynamic Attributed Complex   Networks
021       Many methods have been proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic complex networks. 
020       In its simplest form, a community structure takes the form of a partition of the node set. From the modeling point of view, to be of some utility, this partition must then be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. However, if most of the existing works focus on defining methods for the detection of communities, only very few try to tackle this interpretation problem. Moreover, the existing approaches are limited either in the type of data they handle, or by the nature of the results they output. In this work, we propose a method to efficiently support such a characterization task. We first define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then describe how to identify the most emerging sequential patterns of this dataset, and use them to characterize the communities. We also show how to detect unusual behavior in a community, and highlight outliers. Finally, as an illustration, we apply our method to a network of scientific collaborations.

020       The following question then arises: what is the optimal layout to fulfill best all the demands? Here we present a general solution for this problem with scale-free networks, like the Internet and airline networks. Precisely, we disclose a way to systematically construct networks which are 100$\%$ robust against random failures as well as to malicious attacks. Furthermore, as the sizes of these networks increase, their shortest paths become asymptotically invariant and densities of links go to zero, making them ultra-small worlds and highly sparse, respectively. The first property is ideal for communication and navigation purposes, while the second is interesting economically.

010       Dynamical Immunization Strategy for Seasonal Epidemics
021       The topic of finding effective strategy to halt virus in complex network is of current interest. 
020       We propose an immunization strategy for seasonal epidemics that occur periodically. Based on the local information of the infection status from the previous epidemic season, the selection of vaccinated nodes is optimized gradually. The evolution of vaccinated nodes during iterations demonstrates that the immunization tends to locate in both global hubs and local hubs. We analyze the epidemic prevalence by a heterogeneous mean-field method and present numerical simulations of our model. This immunization performs superiorly to some other previously known strategies. Our work points out a new direction in immunization of seasonal epidemics.

010       A betweenness structure entropy of complex networks
021       The structure entropy is an important index to illuminate the structure property of the complex network. 
020       Most of the existing structure entropies are based on the degree distribution of the complex network. But the structure entropy based on the degree can not illustrate the structure property of the weighted networks. In order to study the structure property of the weighted networks, a new structure entropy of the complex networks based on the betweenness is proposed in this paper. Comparing with the existing structure entropy, the proposed method is more reasonable to describe the structure property of the complex weighted networks.

010       Solving the inverse problem of noise-driven dynamic networks
021       Nowadays massive amount of data are available for analysis in natural and social systems. 
020       Inferring system structures from the data, i.e., the inverse problem, has become one of the central issues in many disciplines and interdisciplinary studies. In this Letter, we study the inverse problem of stochastic dynamic complex networks. We derive analytically a simple and universal inference formula called double correlation matrix (DCM) method. Numerical simulations confirm that the DCM method can accurately depict both network structures and noise correlations by using available kinetic data only. This inference performance was never regarded possible by theoretical derivation, numerical computation and experimental design.

010       Concentric Network Symmetry
021       Quantification of symmetries in complex networks is typically done globally in terms of automorphisms. 
020       Extending previous methods to locally assess the symmetry of nodes is not straightforward. Here we present a new framework to quantify the symmetries around nodes, which we call connectivity patterns. We develop two topological transformations that allow a concise characterization of the different types of symmetry appearing on networks and apply these concepts to six network models, namely the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Barab\'asi-Albert, random geometric graph, Waxman, Voronoi and rewired Voronoi. Real-world networks, namely the scientific areas of Wikipedia, the world-wide airport network and the street networks of Oldenburg and San Joaquin, are also analyzed in terms of the proposed symmetry measurements. Several interesting results emerge from this analysis, including the high symmetry exhibited by the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. Additionally, we found that the proposed measurements present low correlation with other traditional metrics, such as node degree and betweenness centrality. Principal component analysis is used to combine all the results, revealing that the concepts presented here have substantial potential to also characterize networks at a global scale.

010       Epidemic spreading on complex networks with general degree and weight   distributions
021       The spread of disease on complex networks has attracted widely attention in the physics community. 
020       Recent works have demonstrated that heterogeneous degree and weight distributions have a significant influence on the epidemic dynamics. In this study, a novel edge-weight based compartmental approach is developed to estimate the epidemic threshold and epidemic size (final infected density) on networks with general degree and weight distributions, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained. Even in complex network with the strong heterogeneous degree and weight distributions, this approach is worked. We then propose an edge-weight based removal strategy with different biases, and find that such a strategy can effectively control the spread of epidemic when the highly weighted edges are preferentially removed, especially when the weight distribution of a network is extremely heterogenous. The theoretical results from the suggested method can accurately predict the above removal effectiveness.

010       Voting Behavior, Coalitions and Government Strength through a Complex   Network Analysis
021       We analyze the network of relations between parliament members according to their voting behavior. 
020       In particular, we examine the emergent community structure with respect to political coalitions and government alliances. We rely on tools developed in the Complex Network literature to explore the core of these communities and use their topological features to develop new metrics for party polarization, internal coalition cohesiveness and government strength. As a case study, we focus on the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Parliament, for which we are able to characterize the heterogeneity of the ruling coalition as well as parties specific contributions to the stability of the government over time. We find sharp contrast in the political debate which surprisingly does not imply a relevant structure based on establised parties. We take a closer look to changes in the community structure after parties split up and their effect on the position of single deputies within communities. Finally, we introduce a way to track the stability of the government coalition over time that is able to discern the contribution of each member along with the impact of its possible defection. While our case study relies on the Italian parliament, whose relevance has come into the international spotlight in the present economic downturn, the methods developed here are entirely general and can therefore be applied to a multitude of other scenarios.

010       Triadic closure as a basic generating mechanism of communities in   complex networks
021       Most of the complex social, technological and biological networks have a significant community structure. 
020       Therefore the community structure of complex networks has to be considered as a universal property, together with the much explored small-world and scale-free properties of these networks. Despite the large interest in characterizing the community structures of real networks, not enough attention has been devoted to the detection of universal mechanisms able to spontaneously generate networks with communities. Triadic closure is a natural mechanism to make new connections, especially in social networks. Here we show that models of network growth based on simple triadic closure naturally lead to the emergence of community structure, together with fat-tailed distributions of node degree, high clustering coefficients. Communities emerge from the initial stochastic heterogeneity in the concentration of links, followed by a cycle of growth and fragmentation. Communities are the more pronounced, the sparser the graph, and disappear for high values of link density and randomness in the attachment procedure. By introducing a fitness-based link attractivity for the nodes, we find a novel phase transition, where communities disappear for high heterogeneity of the fitness distribution, but a new mesoscopic organization of the nodes emerges, with groups of nodes being shared between just a few superhubs, which attract most of the links of the system.

010       A Thirty Kiloparsec Chain of &quot;Beads on a String&quot; Star Formation Between   Two Merging Early Type Galaxies in the Core of a Strong-Lensing Galaxy   Cluster
021       New Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet and optical imaging of the strong-lensing galaxy cluster SDSS J1531+3414 (z=0.335) reveals two centrally dominant elliptical galaxies participating in an ongoing major merger. 
020       The interaction is at least somewhat rich in cool gas, as the merger is associated with a complex network of nineteen massive superclusters of young stars (or small tidal dwarf galaxies) separated by ~1 kpc in projection from one another, combining to an estimated total star formation rate of ~5 solar masses per year. The resolved young stellar superclusters are threaded by narrow H-alpha, [O II], and blue excess filaments arranged in a network spanning ~27 kpc across the two merging galaxies. This morphology is strongly reminiscent of the well-known "beads on a string" mode of star formation observed on kpc-scales in the arms of spiral galaxies, resonance rings, and in tidal tails between interacting galaxies. Nevertheless, the arrangement of this star formation relative to the nuclei of the two galaxies is difficult to interpret in a dynamical sense, as no known "beads on a string" systems associated with kpc-scale tidal interactions exhibit such lopsided morphology relative to the merger participants. In this Letter we present the images and follow-up spectroscopy, and discuss possible physical interpretations for the unique arrangement of the young stellar clusters. While we suggest that this morphology is likely to be dynamically short-lived, a more quantitative understanding awaits necessary multiwavelength follow-up, including optical integral field spectroscopy, ALMA sub-mm interferometry, and Chandra X-ray imaging.

010       Brand effect versus competitiveness in hypernetworks
021       A few of evolving models in hypernetworks have been proposed based on uniform growth. 
020       In order to better depict the growth mechanism and competitive aspect of real hypernetworks, we propose a model in term of the non-uniform growth. Besides hyperdegrees, the other two important factors are introduced to underlie preferential attachment. One dimension is the brand effect and the other is the competitiveness. Our model can accurately describe the evolution of real hypernetworks. The paper analyzes the model and calculates the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of the hypernetwork by using Poisson process theory and a continuous technique. We also address the limit in which this model has a condensation. The theoretical analyses agree with numerical simulations. Our model is universal, in that the standard preferential attachment, the fitness model in complex networks and scale-free model in hypernetworks can all be seen as degenerate cases of the model.

The theoretical framework consists of a four-layer multiplex network. Regarding the treatment of ties, our approach allows to define a tie between two values when they are close {\em enough}, depending on a threshold. We show an application using data from the Spanish Stock Market; we analyse the series of rankings defined by $25$ companies that have contributed to the IBEX-35 return and volatility values over the period 2003 to 2013.

010       Feature Extraction from Degree Distribution for Comparison and Analysis   of Complex Networks
021       The degree distribution is an important characteristic of complex networks. 
020       In many data analysis applications, the networks should be represented as fixed-length feature vectors and therefore the feature extraction from the degree distribution is a necessary step. Moreover, many applications need a similarity function for comparison of complex networks based on their degree distributions. Such a similarity measure has many applications including classification and clustering of network instances, evaluation of network sampling methods, anomaly detection, and study of epidemic dynamics. The existing methods are unable to effectively capture the similarity of degree distributions, particularly when the corresponding networks have different sizes. Based on our observations about the structure of the degree distributions in networks over time, we propose a feature extraction and a similarity function for the degree distributions in complex networks. We propose to calculate the feature values based on the mean and standard deviation of the node degrees in order to decrease the effect of the network size on the extracted features. The proposed method is evaluated using different artificial and real network datasets, and it outperforms the state of the art methods with respect to the accuracy of the distance function and the effectiveness of the extracted features.

010       Critical Phase in Complex Networks: a Numerical Study
021       We compare phase transition and critical phenomena of bond percolation on Euclidean lattices, nonamenable graphs, and complex networks. 
020       On a Euclidean lattice, percolation shows a phase transition between the nonpercolating phase and percolating phase at the critical point. The critical point is stretched to a finite region, called the critical phase, on nonamenable graphs. To investigate the critical phase, we introduce a fractal exponent, which characterizes a subextensive order of the system. We perform the Monte Carlo simulations for percolation on two nonamenable graphs - the binary tree and the enhanced binary tree. The former shows the nonpercolating phase and the critical phase, whereas the latter shows all three phases. We also examine the possibility of critical phase in complex networks. Our conjecture is that networks with a growth mechanism have only the critical phase and the percolating phase. We study percolation on a stochastically growing network with and without a preferential attachment mechanism, and a deterministically growing network, called the decorated flower, to show that the critical phase appears in those models. We provide a finite-size scaling by using the fractal exponent, which would be a powerful method for numerical analysis of the phase transition involving the critical phase.

020       Texts, collected from different web sources (portals, forums), are represented as directed and weighted co-occurrence complex networks of words. Words are nodes and links are established between two nodes if they are directly co-occurring within the sentence. We test different centrality measures for ranking nodes - keyword candidates. The promising results are achieved using the selectivity measure. Then we propose an approach which enables extracting word pairs according to the values of the in/out selectivity and weight measures combined with filtering.

010       Reconstructing propagation networks with natural diversity and   identifying hidden sources
021       Our ability to uncover complex network structure and dynamics from data is fundamental to understanding and controlling collective dynamics in complex systems. 
020       Despite recent progress in this area, reconstructing networks with stochastic dynamical processes from limited time series remains to be an outstanding problem. Here we develop a framework based on compressed sensing to reconstruct complex networks on which stochastic spreading dynamics take place. We apply the methodology to a large number of model and real networks, finding that a full reconstruction of inhomogeneous interactions can be achieved from small amounts of polarized (binary) data, a virtue of compressed sensing. Further, we demonstrate that a hidden source that triggers the spreading process but is externally inaccessible can be ascertained and located with high confidence in the absence of direct routes of propagation from it. Our approach thus establishes a paradigm for tracing and controlling epidemic invasion and information diffusion in complex networked systems.

010       Toward Selectivity Based Keyword Extraction for Croatian News
021       Preliminary report on network based keyword extraction for Croatian is an unsupervised method for keyword extraction from the complex network. 
020       We build our approach with a new network measure the node selectivity, motivated by the research of the graph based centrality approaches. The node selectivity is defined as the average weight distribution on the links of the single node. We extract nodes (keyword candidates) based on the selectivity value. Furthermore, we expand extracted nodes to word-tuples ranked with the highest in/out selectivity values. Selectivity based extraction does not require linguistic knowledge while it is purely derived from statistical and structural information en-compassed in the source text which is reflected into the structure of the network. Obtained sets are evaluated on a manually annotated keywords: for the set of extracted keyword candidates average F1 score is 24,63%, and average F2 score is 21,19%; for the exacted words-tuples candidates average F1 score is 25,9% and average F2 score is 24,47%.

010       Detection of construction biases in biological databases: the case of   miRBase
021       Biological databases can be analysed as a complex network which may reveal some its underlying biological mechanisms. 
020       Frequently, such databases are identified as scale-free networks or as hierarchical networks depending on connectivity distributions or clustering coefficients. Since these databases do grow over time, one would expect that their network topology may undergo some changes. Here, we analysed the historical versions of miRBase, a database of microRNAs where we performed an alignment of all mature and precursor miRNAs and calculated a pairwise similarity index. We found that the clustering coefficient shows important changes during the growth of this database. For two consecutive versions of the year 2009 we found a strong modification of the network topology which we were able to associate to a technological change in miRNA discovery. To evaluate if these changes could have happened by chance, we performed a set of simulations of the database growth by sampling the final version of miRBase and creating several alternative histories of miRBase. None of the simulations were close to the actual historical evolution of this database, which we understand as a clear indication of a very strong construction bias.

010       Reengineering observatory operations for the time domain
021       Observatories are complex scientific and technical institutions serving diverse users and purposes. 
020       Their telescopes, instruments, software, and human resources engage in interwoven workflows over a broad range of timescales. These workflows have been tuned to be responsive to concepts of observatory operations that were applicable when various assets were commissioned, years or decades in the past. The astronomical community is entering an era of rapid change increasingly characterized by large time domain surveys, robotic telescopes and automated infrastructures, and - most significantly - of operating modes and scientific consortia that span our individual facilities, joining them into complex network entities. <br />Observatories must adapt and numerous initiatives are in progress that focus on redesigning individual components out of the astronomical toolkit. New instrumentation is both more capable and more complex than ever, and even simple instruments may have powerful observation scripting capabilities. Remote and queue observing modes are now widespread. Data archives are becoming ubiquitous. Virtual observatory standards and protocols and astroinformatics data-mining techniques layered on these are areas of active development. Indeed, new large-aperture ground-based telescopes may be as expensive as space missions and have similarly formal project management processes and large data management requirements. <br />This piecewise approach is not enough. Whatever challenges of funding or politics facing the national and international astronomical communities it will be more efficient - scientifically as well as in the usual figures of merit of cost, schedule, performance, and risks - to explicitly address the systems engineering of the astronomical community as a whole.

010       Supersymmetric multiplex networks described by coupled Bose and Fermi   statistics
021       Until now, no simple symmetries have been detected in complex networks. 
020       Here we show that, in growing multiplex networks the symmetries of multilayer structures can be exploited by their dynamical rules, forming supersymmetric multiplex networks described by coupled Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics. The supersymmetric multiplex is formed by layers which are scale-free networks and can display a Bose-Einstein condensation of the links. To characterize the complexity of the supersymmetric multiplex using quantum information tools, we extend the definition of the network entanglement entropy to the layers of multiplex networks. Interestingly we observe a very simple relation between the entanglement entropies of the layers of the supersymmetric multiplex network and the entropy rate of the same multiplex network. This relation therefore connects the classical non equilibrium growing dynamics of the supersymmetric multiplex network with its quantum information static characteristics.

020       In this paper we introduce and study a network model that is based on a latent attribute structure: each node is characterized by a number of features and the probability of the existence of an edge between two nodes depends on the features they share. Features are chosen according to a process of Indian-Buffet type but with an additional random "fitness" parameter attached to each node, that determines its ability to transmit its own features to other nodes. As a consequence, a node's connectivity does not depend on its age alone, so also "young" nodes are able to compete and succeed in acquiring links. One of the advantages of our model for the latent bipartite "node-attribute" network is that it depends on few parameters with a straightforward interpretation. We provide some theoretical, as well experimental, results regarding the power-law behaviour of the model and the estimation of the parameters. By experimental data, we also show how the proposed model for the attribute structure naturally captures most local and global properties (e.g., degree distributions, connectivity and distance distributions) real networks exhibit. keyword: Complex network, social network, attribute matrix, Indian Buffet process

010       Time delay enhanced synchronization in a star network of second order   Kuramoto oscillators
021       We examine the onset of synchronization transition in a star network of Kuramoto phase oscillators in the presence of inertia and a time delay in the coupling. 
020       A direct correlation between the natural frequencies of the oscillators and their degrees is assumed. The presence of time delay is seen to enhance the onset of first order synchronization. The star network also exhibits different synchronization transitions depending on the value of time delay. An analytical prediction to observe the effect of the time delay is provided and further supported by simulation results. Our findings may help provide valuable insights into the understanding of mechanisms that lead to synchronization on complex networks.

010       Variability Analysis of Complex Networks Measures based on Stochastic   Distances
021       Complex networks can model the structure and dynamics of different types of systems. 
020       It has been shown that they are characterized by a set of measures. In this work, we evaluate the variability of complex networks measures face to perturbations and, for this purpose, we impose controlled perturbations and quantify their effect. We analyze theoretical models (random, small-world and scale-free) and real networks (a collaboration network and a metabolic networks) along with the shortest path length, vertex degree, local cluster coefficient and betweenness centrality measures. In such analysis, we propose the use of three stochastic quantifiers: the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Jensen-Shannon and Hellinger distances. The sensitivity of these measures was analyzed with respect to the following perturbations: edge addition, edge removal, edge rewiring and node removal, all of them applied at different intensities. The results reveal that the evaluated measures are influenced by these perturbations. Additionally, hypotheses tests were performed to verify the behavior of the degree distribution to identify the intensity of the perturbations that leads to break this property.

010       Epidemic spreading driven by biased random walks
021       Random walk is one of the basic mechanisms found in many network applications. 
020       We study the epidemic spreading dynamics driven by biased random walks on complex networks. In our epidemic model, each time infected nodes constantly spread some infected packets by biased random walks to their neighbor nodes causing the infection of the susceptible nodes that receive the packets. An infected node get recovered from infection with a fixed probability. Simulation and analytical results on model and real-world networks show that the epidemic spreading becomes intense and wide with the increase of delivery capacity of infected nodes, average node degree, homogeneity of node degree distribution. Furthermore, there are corresponding optimal parameters such that the infected nodes have instantaneously the largest population, and the epidemic spreading process covers the largest part of a network.

010       On MultiAspect Graphs
021       Different graph generalizations have been recently used in an ad-hoc manner to represent multilayer networks, i.e. 
020       systems formed by distinct layers where each layer can be seen as a network. Similar constructions have also been used to represent time-varying networks. We introduce the concept of MultiAspect Graph (MAG) as a graph generalization that we prove to be isomorphic to a directed graph, and also capable of representing all these previous generalizations. In our proposal, the set of vertices, layers, time instants, or any other independent feature is considered as an aspect of the MAG. For instance, a MAG is able to represent multilayer or time-varying networks, while both concepts can also be combined to represent a multilayer time-varying network. Since the MAG structure admits an arbitrary (finite) number of aspects, it hence introduces a powerful modelling abstraction for networked complex systems. This paper formalizes the concept of MAG and then derives theoretical results that can be useful in the analysis of complex networked systems modelled using the proposed MAG abstraction.

010       Network Robustness: Detecting Topological Quantum Phases
021       Can the topology of a network that consists of many particles interacting with each other change in complexity when a phase transition occurs? The answer to this question is particularly interesting to understand the nature of phase transitions if the distinct phases do not break any symmetry, such as topological phase transitions. 
020       Here we present a novel theoretical framework established by complex network analysis for demonstrating that across a transition point of the topological superconductors, the network space experiences a homogeneous-heterogeneous transition invisible in real space. This transition is nothing but related to the robustness of a network to random failures. We suggest that the idea of the network robustness can be applied to characterizing various phase transitions whether or not the symmetry is broken.

010       Optimal search strategies on complex networks
021       Complex networks are ubiquitous in nature and play a role of paramount importance in many contexts. 
020       Internet and the cyberworld, which permeate our everyday life, are self-organized hierarchical graphs. Urban traffic flows on intricate road networks, which impact both transportation design and epidemic control. In the brain, neurons are cabled through heterogeneous connections, which support the propagation of electric signals. In all these cases, the true challenge is to unveil the mechanisms through which specific dynamical features are modulated by the underlying topology of the network. Here, we consider agents randomly hopping along the links of a graph, with the additional possibility of performing long-range hops to randomly chosen disconnected nodes with a given probability. We show that an optimal combination of the two jump rules exists that maximises the efficiency of target search, the optimum reflecting the topology of the network.

010       Epidemic processes in complex networks
021       In recent years the research community has accumulated overwhelming evidence for the emergence of complex and heterogeneous connectivity patterns in a wide range of biological and socio-technical systems. 
020       The complex properties of real world networks have a profound impact on the behavior of equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena occurring in various systems, and the study of epidemic spreading is central to our understanding of the unfolding of dynamical processes in complex networks. The theoretical analysis of epidemic spreading in heterogeneous networks requires the development of novel analytical frameworks, and it has produced results of conceptual and practical relevance. Here we present a coherent and comprehensive review of the vast research activity concerning epidemic processes, detailing the successful theoretical approaches as well as making their limits and assumptions clear. Physicists, epidemiologists, computer and social scientists share a common interest in studying epidemic spreading and rely on very similar models for the description of the diffusion of pathogens, knowledge, and innovation. For this reason, while we focus on the main results and the paradigmatic models in infectious disease modeling, we also present the major results concerning generalized social contagion processes. Finally we outline the research activity at the forefront in the study of epidemic spreading in co-evolving and time-varying networks.

021       What can we learn from the collective dynamics of a complex network about its interaction topology? Taking the perspective from nonlinear dynamics, we briefly review recent progress on how to infer structural connectivity (direct interactions) from accessing the dynamics of the units. 
020       Potential applications range from interaction networks in physics, to chemical and metabolic reactions, protein and gene regulatory networks as well as neural circuits in biology and electric power grids or wireless sensor networks in engineering. Moreover, we briefly mention some standard ways of inferring effective or functional connectivity.

010       Fermionic Networks: Modeling Adaptive Complex Networks with Fermionic   Gases
021       We study the structure of Fermionic networks, i.e., a model of networks based on the behavior of fermionic gases, and we analyze dynamical processes over them. 
020       In this model, particle dynamics have been mapped to the domain of networks, hence a parameter representing the temperature controls the evolution of the system. In doing so, it is possible to generate adaptive networks, i.e., networks whose structure varies over time. As shown in previous works, networks generated by quantum statistics can undergo critical phenomena as phase transitions and, moreover, they can be considered as thermodynamic systems. In this study, we analyze Fermionic networks and opinion dynamics processes over them, framing this network model as a computational model useful to represent complex and adaptive systems. Results highlight that a strong relation holds between the gas temperature and the structure of the achieved networks. Notably, both the degree distribution and the assortativity vary as the temperature varies, hence we can state that fermionic networks behave as adaptive networks. On the other hand, it is worth to highlight that we did not find relation between outcomes of opinion dynamics processes and the gas temperature. Therefore, although the latter plays a fundamental role in gas dynamics, on the network domain its importance is related only to structural properties of fermionic networks.

010       Local rewiring rules for evolving complex networks
021       The effects of link rewiring are considered for the class of directed networks where each node has the same fixed out-degree. 
020       We model a network generated by three mechanisms that are present in various networked systems; growth, global rewiring and local rewiring. During a rewiring phase a node is randomly selected, one of its out-going edges is detached from its destination then re-attached to the network in one of two possible ways; either globally to a randomly selected node, or locally to a descendant of a descendant of the originally selected node. Although the probability of attachment to a node increases with its connectivity, the probability of detachment also increases, the result is an exponential degree distribution with a small number of outlying nodes that have extremely large degree. We explain these outliers by identifying the circumstances for which a set of nodes can grow to very high degree.

010       Determination of multifractal dimensions of complex networks by means of   the sandbox algorithm
021       Complex networks have attracted much attention in diverse areas of science and technology. 
020       Multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. In this paper, we employ the sandbox (SB) algorithm proposed by T\'{e}l et al. (Physica A, 159 (1989) 155-166), for MFA of complex networks. First we compare the SB algorithm with two existing algorithms of MFA for complex networks: the compact-box-burning (CBB) algorithm proposed by Furuya and Yakubo (Phys. Rev. E, 84 (2011) 036118), and the improved box-counting (BC) algorithm proposed by Li et al. (J. Stat. Mech.: Theor. Exp., 2014 (2014) P02020) by calculating the mass exponents tau(q) of some deterministic model networks. We make a detailed comparison between the numerical and theoretical results of these model networks. The comparison results show that the SB algorithm is the most effective and feasible algorithm to calculate the mass exponents tau(q) and to explore the multifractal behavior of complex networks. Then we apply the SB algorithm to study the multifractal property of some classic model networks, such as scale-free networks, small-world networks, and random networks. Our results show that multifractality exists in scale-free networks, that of small-world networks is not obvious, and it almost does not exist in random networks.

010       Weighted Hypernetworks
021       Complex network theory has been used to study complex systems. 
020       However, many real life systems involve multiple kinds of objects . They can't be described by simple graphs. In order to provide complete information of these systems, we extend the concept of evolving models of complex networks to hypernetworks. In this work, we firstly propose a non-uniform hypernetwork model with attractiveness, and obtain the stationary average hyperdegree distribution of the non-uniform hypernetwork. Furthermore, we develop a model for weighted hypernetworks that couples the establishment of new hyperedges and nodes and the weights' dynamical evolution. We obtain the stationary average hyperdegree and hyperstrength distribution by using the hyperdegree distribution of the hypernetwork model with attractiveness, respectively. In particular, the model yields a nontrivial time evolution of nodes' properties and scale-free behavior for the hyperdegree and hyperstrength distribution. It is expected that our work may give help to the study of the hypernetworks in real-world systems.

021       Small-world networks---complex networks characterized by a combination of high clustering and short path lengths---are widely studied using the paradigmatic model of Watts and Strogatz (WS). 
020       Although the WS model is already quite minimal and intuitive, we describe an alternative formulation of the WS model in terms of a distance-dependent probability of connection that further simplifies, both practically and theoretically, the generation of directed and undirected WS-type small-world networks. In addition to highlighting an essential feature of the WS model that has previously been overlooked, this alternative formulation makes it possible to derive exact expressions for quantities such as the degree and motif distributions and global clustering coefficient for both directed and undirected networks in terms of model parameters.

021       Identifying the node spreading influence in networks is an important task to optimally use the network structure and ensure the more efficient spreading in information. 
020       In this paper, by taking into account the shortest distance between a target node and the node set with the highest $k$-core value, we present an improved method to generate the ranking list to evaluate the node spreading influence. Comparing with the epidemic process results for four real networks and the Barab\'{a}si-Albert network, the parameterless method could identify the node spreading influence more accurately than the ones generated by the degree $k$, closeness centrality, $k$-shell and mixed degree decomposition methods. This work would be helpful for deeply understanding the node importance of a network.

010       Community structure revealed by phase locking
021       Community structure can naturally emerge in paths to synchronization, and scratching it from the paths is a tough issue that accounts for the diverse dynamics of synchronization. 
020       In this paper, with assumption that the synchronization on complex networks is made up of local and collective processes, we proposed a scheme to lock the local synchronization (phase locking) at a stable state meanwhile suppress the collective synchronization based on Kuramoto model. Through this scheme, the network dynamics only contains the local synchronization, which suggests that the nodes in the same community synchronize together and these synchronization clusters well reveal the community structure of network. Furthermore, by analyzing the paths to synchronization, the relations or overlaps among different communities are also obtained. Thus, the community detection based on the scheme is performed on five real networks and the observed community structures are much more apparent than modularity-based fast algorithm. Our results not only provide a deep insight to understand the synchronization dynamics on complex network but also enlarge the research scope of community detection.

010       Whether Information Network Supplements Friendship Network
021       Homophily is a significant mechanism for link prediction in complex network, of which principle describes that people with similar profiles or experiences tend to tie with each other. 
020       In a multi-relationship network, friendship among people has been utilized to reinforce similarity of taste for recommendation system whose basic idea is similar to homophily, yet how the taste inversely affects friendship prediction is little discussed. This paper contributes to address the issue by analyzing two benchmark datasets both including user's behavioral information of taste and friendship based on the principle of homophily. It can be found that the creation of friendship tightly associates with personal taste. Especially, the behavioral information of taste involving with popular objects is much more effective to improve the performance of friendship prediction. However, this result seems to be contradictory to the finding in [Q.M. Zhang, et al., PLoS ONE 8(2013)e62624] that the behavior information of taste involving with popular objects is redundant in recommendation system. We thus discuss this inconformity to comprehensively understand the correlation between them.

010       A general method for identifying node spreading influence via the   adjacent matrix and spreading rate
021       With great theoretical and practical significance, identifying the node spreading influence of complex network is one of the most promising domains. 
020       So far, various topology-based centrality measures have been proposed to identify the node spreading influence in a network. However, the node spreading influence is a result of the interplay between the network topology structure and spreading dynamics. In this paper, we build up the systematic method by combining the network structure and spreading dynamics to identify the node spreading influence. By combining the adjacent matrix $A$ and spreading parameter $\beta$, we theoretical give the node spreading influence with the eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Comparing with the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model epidemic results for four real networks, our method could identify the node spreading influence more accurately than the ones generated by the degree, K-shell and eigenvector centrality.

010       Google matrix analysis of directed networks
021       In past ten years, modern societies developed enormous communication and social networks. 
020       Their classification and information retrieval processing become a formidable task for the society. Due to the rapid growth of World Wide Web, social and communication networks, new mathematical methods have been invented to characterize the properties of these networks on a more detailed and precise level. Various search engines are essentially using such methods. It is highly important to develop new tools to classify and rank enormous amount of network information in a way adapted to internal network structures and characteristics. This review describes the Google matrix analysis of directed complex networks demonstrating its efficiency on various examples including World Wide Web, Wikipedia, software architecture, world trade, social and citation networks, brain neural networks, DNA sequences and Ulam networks. The analytical and numerical matrix methods used in this analysis originate from the fields of Markov chains, quantum chaos and Random Matrix theory.

010       Perturbation Detection Through Modeling of Gene Expression on a Latent   Biological Pathway Network: A Bayesian hierarchical approach
021       Cellular response to a perturbation is the result of a dynamic system of biological variables linked in a complex network. 
020       A major challenge in drug and disease studies is identifying the key factors of a biological network that are essential in determining the cell's fate. <br />Here our goal is the identification of perturbed pathways from high-throughput gene expression data. We develop a three-level hierarchical model, where (i) the first level captures the relationship between gene expression and biological pathways using confirmatory factor analysis, (ii) the second level models the behavior within an underlying network of pathways induced by an unknown perturbation using a conditional autoregressive model, and (iii) the third level is a spike-and-slab prior on the perturbations. We then identify perturbations through posterior-based variable selection. <br />We illustrate our approach using gene transcription drug perturbation profiles from the DREAM7 drug sensitivity predication challenge data set. Our proposed method identified regulatory pathways that are known to play a causative role and that were not readily resolved using gene set enrichment analysis or exploratory factor models. Simulation results are presented assessing the performance of this model relative to a network-free variant and its robustness to inaccuracies in biological databases.

010       Dynamics of stress p53: Nitric oxide induced transition of states and   synchronization
021       We study the temporal and the synchronous behaviours in p53-Mdm2 regulatory network due to the interaction of its complex network components with the nitric oxide molecule. 
020       In single cell process, increase in nitric oxide concentration gives rise the transition to various p53 temporal behaviours, namely fixed point oscillation, damped oscillation and sustain oscillation indicating stability, weakly activated and strongly activated states. The noise in stochastic system is found to help to reach these states much faster as compared to deterministic case which is evident from permutation entropy dynamics. In coupled system with nitric oxide as diffusively coupling molecule, we found nitric oxide as strong coupling molecule within a certain range of coupling strength \epsilon beyond which it become weak synchronizing agent. We study these effects by using correlation like synchronization indicator \gamma obtained from permutation entropies of the coupled system, and found five important regimes in (\epsilon-\gamma) phase diagram, indicating desynchronized, transition, strongly synchronized, moderately synchronized and weakly synchronized regimes respectively. We claim that there is the competition between the toxicity and the synchronizing role of nitric oxide that lead the cell in different stressed conditions.

010       Building complex networks through classical and Bayesian statistics - a   comparison
021       This research is about studying and comparing two different ways of building complex networks. 
020       The main goal of our study is to find an effective way to build networks, particularly when we have fewer observations than variables. We construct networks estimating the partial correlation coefficient on Classic Statistics (Inverse Method) and on Bayesian Statistics (Normal - Inverse Wishart conjugate prior). In this current work, in order to solve the problem of having less observations than variables, we propose a new methodology called local partial correlation, which consists of selecting, for each pair of variables, the other variables most correlated to the pair.We applied these methods on simulated data and compared them through ROC curves. The most attractive result is that, even though it has high computational costs, to use Bayesian inference on trees is better when we have less observations than variables. In other cases, both approaches present satisfactory results.

010       Complex Network Approach to Number Theory
021       In this short paper, following the most recent advances in complex network theory, a new approach to number theory with potential applications to other fields is proposed. 
020       The model by Garcia-Perez, Serrano and Boguna, introduces an algorithm which allows to create a bipartite graph of integers (with primes and composites) statistically very close to the real one. Since the algorithm is defined a priori, we can have a description of the simulated prime number distribution in terms of a known differential equation, which in general can be treated more easily. The so determined properties of the simulated distribution can give useful hints about the behavior of the real prime number distribution. In principle it could be also possible to demonstrate open questions in number theory, proven the total equivalence of the simulated and real distributions.

010       Fractional calculus ties the microscopic and macroscopic scales of   complex network dynamics
021       A two-state master equation based decision making model has been shown to generate phase transitions, to be topologically complex and to manifest temporal complexity through an inverse power-law probability distribution function in the switching times between the two critical states of consensus. 
020       These properties are entailed by the fundamental assumption that the network elements in the decision making model imperfectly imitate one another. The process of subordination establishes that a single network element can be described by a fractional master equation whose analytic solution yields the observed inverse power-law probability distribution obtained by numerical integration of the two-state master equation to a high degree of accuracy.

010       Limitations and tradeoff in synchronization of large-scale stochastic   networks
021       We study synchronization in scalar nonlinear systems connected over a linear network with stochastic uncertainty in their interactions. 
020       We provide a sufficient condition for the synchronization of such network systems expressed in terms of the parameters of the nonlinear scalar dynamics, the second and largest eigenvalues of the mean interconnection Laplacian, and the variance of the stochastic uncertainty. The sufficient condition is independent of network size thereby making it attractive for verification of synchronization in a large size network. The main contribution of this paper is to provide analytical characterization for the interplay of roles played by the internal dynamics of the nonlinear system, network topology, and uncertainty statistics in network synchronization. We show there exist important tradeoffs between these various network parameters necessary to achieve synchronization. We show for nearest neighbor networks with stochastic uncertainty in interactions there exists an optimal number of neighbors with maximum margin for synchronization. This proves in the presence of interaction uncertainty, too many connections among network components is just as harmful for synchronization as the lack of connection. We provide an analytical formula for the optimal gain required to achieve maximum synchronization margin thereby allowing us to compare various complex network topology for their synchronization property.

010       Quantum Google Algorithm: Construction and Application to Complex   Networks

The algorithm has been shown to identify unambiguously the underlying topology of the network and to be capable of clearly highlighting the structure of secondary hubs of networks. Furthermore, it can resolve the degeneracy in importance of the low-lying part of the list of rankings. Examples of applications include real-world instances from the WWW, which typically display a scale-free network structure and models of hierarchical networks. The quantum algorithm has been shown to display an increased stability with respect to a variation of the damping parameter, present in the Google algorithm, and a more clearly pronounced power-law behaviour in the distribution of importance among the nodes, as compared to the classical algorithm.

010       An Information-Theoretic Formalism for Multiscale Structure in Complex   Systems
021       We develop a general formalism for representing and understanding structure in complex systems. 
020       In our view, structure is the totality of relationships among a system's components, and these relationships can be quantified using information theory. In the interest of flexibility we allow information to be quantified using any function, including Shannon entropy and Kolmogorov complexity, that satisfies certain fundamental axioms. Using these axioms, we formalize the notion of a dependency among components, and show how a system's structure is revealed in the amount of information assigned to each dependency. We explore quantitative indices that summarize system structure, providing a new formal basis for the complexity profile and introducing a new index, the "marginal utility of information". Using simple examples, we show how these indices capture intuitive ideas about structure in a quantitative way. Our formalism also sheds light on a longstanding mystery: that the mutual information of three or more variables can be negative. We discuss applications to complex networks, gene regulation, the kinetic theory of fluids and multiscale cybernetic thermodynamics.

010       Core-like groups resulting in invalidation of k-shell decomposition   analysis
021       Identifying the most influential spreaders is an important issue in understanding and controlling spreading processes on complex networks. 
020       Recent studies showed that nodes located in the core of a network as identified by the k-shell decomposition are the most influential spreaders. However, through a great deal of numerical simulations, we observe that not in all real networks do nodes in high shells are very influential: in some networks the core nodes are the most influential which we call true core, while in others nodes in high shells, even the innermost core, are not good spreaders which we call core-like group. By analyzing the k-core structure of the networks, we find that the true core of a network links diversely to the shells of the network, while the core-like group links very locally within the group. For nodes in the core-like group, the k-shell index cannot reflect their location importance in the network. We further introduce a measure based on the link diversity of shells to effectively distinguish the true core and core-like group, and identify core-like groups throughout the networks. Our findings help to better understand the structural features of real networks and influential nodes.

010       Multiplexity versus correlation: the role of local constraints in real   multiplexes
021       Several real-world systems can be represented as multi-layer complex networks, i.e. 
020       in terms of a superposition of various graphs, each related to a different mode of connection between nodes. Hence, the definition of proper mathematical quantities aiming at capturing the level of complexity of those systems is required. Various attempts have been made to measure the empirical dependencies between the layers of a multiplex, for both binary and weighted networks. In the simplest case, such dependencies are measured via correlation-based metrics: we show that this is equivalent to the use of completely homogeneous benchmarks specifying only global constraints, such as the total number of links in each layer. However, these approaches do not take into account the heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions, which are instead a fundamental feature of real-world multiplexes. In this work, we compare the observed dependencies between layers with the expected values obtained from reference models that appropriately control for the observed heterogeneity in the degree and strength distributions. This leads to novel multiplexity measures that we test on different datasets, i.e. the International Trade Network (ITN) and the European Airport Network (EAN). Our findings confirm that the use of homogeneous benchmarks can lead to misleading results, and furthermore highlight the important role played by the distribution of hubs across layers.

021       In this work, we study properties of texts from the perspective of complex network theory. 
020       Words in given texts are linked by co-occurrence and transformed into networks, and we observe that these display topological properties common to other complex systems. However, there are some properties that seem to be exclusive to texts; many of these properties depend on the frequency of words in the text, while others seem to be strictly determined by the grammar. Precisely, these properties allow for a categorization of texts as either with a sense and others encoded or senseless.

010       Overlapping Communities in Complex Networks
021       Communities are subsets of a network that are densely connected inside and share only few connections to the rest of the network. 
020       The aim of this research is the development and evaluation of an efficient algorithm for detection of overlapping, fuzzy communities. The algorithm gets as input some members of each community that we aim to discover. We call these members seed nodes. The algorithm then propagates this information by using random walks that start at non-seed nodes and end as they reach a seed node. The probability that a random walk starting at a non-seed node $v$ ends at a seed node $s$ is then equated with the probability that $v$ belongs to the communities of $s$. The algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(l \cdot m \cdot \log n)$, where $l$ is the number of communities to detect, $m$ is the number of edges, $n$ is the number of nodes. The $\tilde{O}$-notation hides a factor of at most $(\log \log n)^2$. The LFR benchmark proposed by Lancichinetti et al.\ is used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. We found that, given a good set of seed nodes, it is able to reconstruct the communities of a network in a meaningful manner.

021       In this paper, we propose a novelty-based metric for quantitative characterization of the controllability of complex networks. 
020       This inherently bounded metric describes the average angular separation of an input with respect to the past input history. We use this metric to find the minimally novel input that drives a linear network to a desired state using unit average energy. Specifically, the minimally novel input is defined as the solution of a continuous time, non-convex optimal control problem based on the introduced metric. We provide conditions for existence and uniqueness, and an explicit, closed-form expression for the solution. We support our theoretical results by characterizing the minimally novel inputs for an example of a recurrent neuronal network.

010       Building Damage-Resilient Dominating Sets in Complex Networks against   Random and Targeted Attacks
021       We study the vulnerability of dominating sets against random and targeted node removals in complex networks. 
020       While small, cost-efficient dominating sets play a significant role in controllability and observability of these networks, a fixed and intact network structure is always implicitly assumed. We find that cost-efficiency of dominating sets optimized for small size alone comes at a price of being vulnerable to damage; domination in the remaining network can be severely disrupted, even if a small fraction of dominator nodes are lost. We develop two new methods for finding flexible dominating sets, allowing either adjustable overall resilience, or dominating set size, while maximizing the dominated fraction of the remaining network after the attack. We analyze the efficiency of each method on synthetic scale-free networks, as well as real complex networks.

010       Complexity, Selectivity and Asymmetry in the Conformation of the Power   Phenomenon. Analysis of Chilean Society
021       In this work we analyzed the relationships between powerful politicians and businessmen of Chile in order to study the phenomenon of social power. 
020       We developed our study according to Complex Network Theory but also using traditional sociological theories of Power and Elites. Our analyses suggest that the studied network displays common properties of Complex Networks, such as scaling in connectivity distribution, properties of small-world networks, and modular structure, among others. We also observed that social power (a proposed metric is presented in this work) is also distributed inhomogeneously. However, the most interesting observation is that this inhomogeneous power and connectivity distribution, among other observed properties, may be the result of a dynamic and unregulated process of network growth in which powerful people tend to link to similar others. The compatibility between people, increasingly selective as the network grows, could generate the presence of extremely powerful people, but also a constant inequality of power where the difference between the most powerful is the same as among the least powerful. Our results are also in accordance with sociological theories.

010       A unified data representation theory for network visualization, ordering   and coarse-graining
021       Representation of large data sets became a key question of many scientific disciplines in the last decade. 
020       Several approaches for network visualization, data ordering and coarse-graining accomplished this goal. However, there was no underlying theoretical framework linking these problems. Here we show an elegant, information theoretic data representation approach as a unified solution of network visualization, data ordering and coarse-graining. The optimal representation is the hardest to distinguish from the original data matrix, measured by the relative entropy. The representation of network nodes as probability distributions provides an efficient visualization method and, in one dimension, an ordering of network nodes and edges. Coarse-grained representations of the input network enable both efficient data compression and hierarchical visualization to achieve high quality representations of larger data sets. Our unified data representation theory will help the analysis of extensive data sets, by revealing the large-scale structure of complex networks in a comprehensible form.

010       Identification of Dynamic functional brain network states Through Tensor   Decomposition
021       With the advances in high resolution neuroimaging, there has been a growing interest in the detection of functional brain connectivity. 
020       Complex network theory has been proposed as an attractive mathematical representation of functional brain networks. However, most of the current studies of functional brain networks have focused on the computation of graph theoretic indices for static networks, i.e. long-time averages of connectivity networks. It is well-known that functional connectivity is a dynamic process and the construction and reorganization of the networks is key to understanding human cognition. Therefore, there is a growing need to track dynamic functional brain networks and identify time intervals over which the network is quasi-stationary. In this paper, we present a tensor decomposition based method to identify temporally invariant 'network states' and find a common topographic representation for each state. The proposed methods are applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) data during the study of error-related negativity (ERN).

020       However, there has been less effort towards comparing between different networks. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to rank alternative complex networks based on their performances. We consider this as a ranking problem in decision analysis based on occurring positive/negative frequent events as criteria, and using the TOPSIS method to rank alternatives. In order to assign a score to the networks for each criterion, a statistical method that estimates the expected value of positive/negative frequent events on a random node is presented. The proposed technique is efficient in terms of algorithm complexity and is capable of discriminating events occurring between important nodes over those between less significant nodes. The experiments, conducted on several synthetic networks, demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the ranking methodology.

010       Mediated attachment as a mechanism for growth of complex networks
021       Connection topologies of many networked systems like human brain, biological cell, world wide web, power grids, human society and ecological food webs markedly deviate from that of completely random networks indicating the presence of organizing principles behind their evolution. 
020       The five important features that characterize such networks are scale-free topology, small average path length, high clustering, hierarchical community structure and assortative mixing. Till now the generic mechanisms underlying the existence of these properties are not well understood. Here we show that potentially a single mechanism, which we call "mediated attachment", where two nodes get connected through a mediator or common neighbor, could be responsible for the emergence of all important properties of real networks. The mediated attachment naturally unifies scale-free topology, high clustering, small world nature, hierarchical community structure and dissortative nature of networks. Further, with additional mixing by age, this can also explain the assortative structure of social networks. The mechanism of mediated attachment seems to be directly present in acquaintance networks, co-authorships, World Wide Web, metabolic networks, co-citations and linguistics. We anticipate that this mechanism will shed new light on percolation and robustness properties of real world networks as well as would give new insights in processes like epidemics spreading and emergent dynamics taking place on them.

010       Identifying effective multiple spreaders by coloring complex networks
021       How to identify influential nodes in social networks is of theoretical significance, which relates to how to prevent epidemic spreading or cascading failure, how to accelerate information diffusion, and so on. 
020       In this Letter, we make an attempt to find \emph{effective multiple spreaders} in complex networks by generalizing the idea of the coloring problem in graph theory to complex networks. In our method, each node in a network is colored by one kind of color and nodes with the same color are sorted into an independent set. Then, for a given centrality index, the nodes with the highest centrality in an independent set are chosen as multiple spreaders. Comparing this approach with the traditional method, in which nodes with the highest centrality from the \emph{entire} network perspective are chosen, we find that our method is more effective in accelerating the spreading process and maximizing the spreading coverage than the traditional method, no matter in network models or in real social networks. Meanwhile, the low computational complexity of the coloring algorithm guarantees the potential applications of our method.

010       Reconstructing topological properties of complex networks using the   fitness model
021       A major problem in the study of complex socioeconomic systems is represented by privacy issues$-$that can put severe limitations on the amount of accessible information, forcing to build models on the basis of incomplete knowledge. 
020       In this paper we investigate a novel method to reconstruct global topological properties of a complex network starting from limited information. This method uses the knowledge of an intrinsic property of the nodes (indicated as fitness), and the number of connections of only a limited subset of nodes, in order to generate an ensemble of exponential random graphs that are representative of the real systems and that can be used to estimate its topological properties. Here we focus in particular on reconstructing the most basic properties that are commonly used to describe a network: density of links, assortativity, clustering. We test the method on both benchmark synthetic networks and real economic and financial systems, finding a remarkable robustness with respect to the number of nodes used for calibration. The method thus represents a valuable tool for gaining insights on privacy-protected systems.

010       On Dynamically Generating Relevant Elementary Flux Modes in a Metabolic   Network using Optimization
021       Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are pathways through a metabolic reaction network that connect external substrates to products. 
020       Using EFMs, a metabolic network can be transformed into its macroscopic counterpart, in which the internal metabolites have been eliminated and only external metabolites remain. In EFMs-based metabolic flux analysis (MFA) experimentally determined external fluxes are used to estimate the flux of each EFM. It is in general prohibitive to enumerate all EFMs for complex networks, since the number of EFMs increases rapidly with network complexity. In this work we present an optimization-based method that dynamically generates a subset of EFMs and solves the EFMs-based MFA problem simultaneously. The obtained subset contains EFMs that contribute to the optimal solution of the EFMs-based MFA problem. The usefulness of our method was examined in a case-study using data from a Chinese hamster ovary cell culture and two networks of varied complexity. It was demonstrated that the EFMs-based MFA problem could be solved at a low computational cost, even for the more complex network. Additionally, only a fraction of the total number of EFMs was needed to compute the optimal solution.

010       Structurally Robust Control of Complex Networks
021       Robust control theory has been successfully applied to numerous real-world problems using a small set of devices called {\it controllers}. 
020       However, the real systems represented by networks contain unreliable components and modern robust control engineering has not addressed the problem of structural changes on a large network. Here, we introduce the concept of structurally robust control of complex networks and provide a concrete example using an algorithmic framework that is widely applied in engineering. The developed analytical tools, computer simulations and real network analyses lead herein to the discovery that robust control can be achieved in scale-free networks with exactly the same order of controllers required in a standard non-robust configuration by adjusting only the minimum degree. The presented methodology also addresses the probabilistic failure of links in real systems, such as neural synaptic unreliability in {\it C. elegans}, and suggests a new direction to pursue in studies of complex networks in which control theory has a role.

010       Explosive synchronization in adaptive and multilayer networks
021       Explosive synchronization (ES) is nowadays a hot topic of interest in nonlinear science and complex networks. 
020       So far, it is conjectured that ES is rooted in the setting of specific microscopic correlation features between the natural frequencies of the networked oscillators and their effective coupling strengths. We show that ES, in fact, is far more general, and can occur in adaptive and multilayer networks also in the absence of such correlation properties. Precisely, we first report evidence of ES in the absence of correlation for networks where a fraction f of the nodes have links adaptively controlled by a local order parameter, and then we extend the study to a variety of two-layer networks with a fraction f of their nodes coupled each other by means of dependency links. In this latter case, we even show that ES sets in, regardless of the differences in the frequency distribution and/or in the topology of connections between the two layers. Finally, we provide a rigorous, analytical, treatment to properly ground all the observed scenario, and to facilitate the understanding of the actual mechanisms at the basis of ES in real-world systems.

010       Measuring multiple evolution mechanisms of complex networks
021       Traditionally, numerous simple models such as preferential attachment have been put forward to reveal the evolution mechanisms of real networks. 
020       However, previous simulations show that real networks usually are driven by various features instead of single pure mechanism. To solve this problem, some pioneers proposed a few hybrid models of mixing multiple evolution mechanisms and tried to uncover the contributions of different mechanisms. In this paper, we introduce two methods which can tackle this problem: one is based on link prediction model, and the other is based on likelihood analysis. To examine the effectiveness, we generate plenty of artificial networks which can be controlled to follow multiple mechanisms with different weights, so that we can compare the estimated weights with the true values. The experimental results show the method based on likelihood analysis performs much better and gives very accurate estimations. At last, we apply this method to real networks to see how popularity and clustering co-evolve. We find most of them are affected by both popularity and clustering, but with quite different weights.

010       Regulation of burstiness by network-driven activation
021       We prove that complex networks of interactions have the capacity to regulate and buffer unpredictable fluctuations in production events. 
020       We show that non-bursty network-driven activation dynamics can effectively regulate the level of burstiness in the production of nodes, which can be enhanced or reduced. Burstiness can be induced even when the endogenous inter-event time distribution of nodes' production is non-bursty. We found that hubs tend to be less controllable than low degree nodes, which are more susceptible to the networked regulatory effects. Our results have important implications for the analysis and engineering of bursty activity in a range of systems, from telecommunication networks to transcription and translation of genes into proteins in cells.

010       Efficient transmission of subthreshold signals in complex networks of   spiking neurons
021       We investigate the efficient transmission and processing of weak, subthreshold signals in a realistic neural medium in the presence of different levels of the underlying noise. 
020       Assuming Hebbian weights for maximal synaptic conductances -- that naturally balances the network with excitatory and inhibitory synapses -- and considering short-term synaptic plasticity affecting such conductances, we found different dynamic phases in the system. This includes a memory phase where population of neurons remain synchronized, an oscillatory phase where transitions between different synchronized populations of neurons appears and an asynchronous or noisy phase. When a weak stimulus input is applied to each neuron, increasing the level of noise in the medium we found an efficient transmission of such stimuli around the transition and critical points separating different phases for well-defined different levels of stochasticity in the system. We proved that this intriguing phenomenon is quite robust, as it occurs in different situations including several types of synaptic plasticity, different type and number of stored patterns and diverse network topologies, namely, diluted networks and complex topologies such as scale-free and small-world networks. We conclude that the robustness of the phenomenon in different realistic scenarios, including spiking neurons, short-term synaptic plasticity and complex networks topologies, make very likely that it could also occur in actual neural systems as recent psycho-physical experiments suggest.

010       Global Value Trees
021       The fragmentation of production across countries has become an important feature of the globalization in recent decades and is often conceptualized by the term, global value chains (GVCs). 
020       When empirically investigating the GVCs, previous studies are mainly interested in knowing how global the GVCs are rather than how the GVCs look like. From a complex networks perspective, we use the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to study the global production system. We find that the industry-level GVCs are indeed not chain-like but are better characterized by the tree topology. Hence, we compute the global value trees (GVTs) for all the industries available in the WIOD. Moreover, we compute an industry importance measure based on the GVTs and compare it with other network centrality measures. Finally, we discuss some future applications of the GVTs.

010       Discovering the structure of complex networks by minimizing cyclic   bandwidth sum
021       Getting a labeling of vertices close to the structure of the graph has been proved to be of interest in many applications e.g., to follow smooth signals indexed by the vertices of the network. 
020       This question can be related to a graph labeling problem known as the cyclic bandwidth sum problem. It consists in finding a labeling of the vertices of an undirected and unweighted graph with distinct integers such that the sum of (cyclic) difference of labels of adjacent vertices is minimized. Although theoretical results exist that give optimal value of cyclic bandwidth sum for standard graphs, there are neither results in the general case, nor explicit methods to reach this optimal result. In addition to this lack of theoretical knowledge, only a few methods have been proposed to approximately solve this problem. In this paper, we introduce a new heuristic to find an approximate solution for the cyclic bandwidth sum problem, by following the structure of the graph. The heuristic is a two-step algorithm: the first step consists of traversing the graph to find a set of paths which follow the structure of the graph, using a similarity criterion based on the Jaccard index to jump from one vertex to the next one. The second step is the merging of all obtained paths, based on a greedy approach that extends a partial solution by inserting a new path at the position that minimizes the cyclic bandwidth sum. The effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, both in terms of performance and time execution, is shown through experiments on graphs whose optimal value of CBS is known as well as on real-world networks, where the consistence between labeling and topology is highlighted. An extension to weighted graphs is also proposed.

010       A novel brain partition highlights the modular skeleton shared by   structure and function
021       Elucidating the intricate relationship between brain structure and function, both in healthy and pathological conditions, is a key challenge for modern neuroscience. 
020       Recent technical and methodological progress in neuroimaging has helped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion weighted images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and functional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state functional connectivity (rsFC). However, comparing these two distinct datasets, each of which can be encoded into a different complex network, is by no means trivial as pairwise link-to-link comparisons represent a relatively restricted perspective and provide only limited information. Thus, we have adopted a more integrative systems approach, exploiting theoretical graph analyses to study both SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects. The aim is to find the main architectural traits shared by the structural and functional networks by paying special attention to their common hierarchical modular organization. This approach allows us to identify a common skeleton from which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted, with modules sharing both structure and function. We describe these emerging common structure-function modules (SFMs) in detail. In addition, we compare SFMs with the classical Resting State Networks derived from independent component analysis of rs-fMRI functional activity, as well as with anatomical parcellations in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas and with the Broadmann partition, highlighting their similitude and differences. The unveiling of SFMs brings to light the strong correspondence between brain structure and resting-state dynamics.

010       Algorithms for Mapping Parallel Processes onto Grid and Torus   Architectures
021       Static mapping is the assignment of parallel processes to the processing elements (PEs) of a parallel system, where the assignment does not change during the application's lifetime. 
020       In our scenario we model an application's computations and their dependencies by an application graph. This graph is first partitioned into (nearly) equally sized blocks. These blocks need to communicate at block boundaries. To assign the processes to PEs, our goal is to compute a communication-efficient bijective mapping between the blocks and the PEs. <br />This approach of partitioning followed by bijective mapping has many degrees of freedom. Thus, users and developers of parallel applications need to know more about which choices work for which application graphs and which parallel architectures. To this end, we not only develop new mapping algorithms (derived from known greedy methods). We also perform extensive experiments involving different classes of application graphs (meshes and complex networks), architectures of parallel computers (grids and tori), as well as different partitioners and mapping algorithms. Surprisingly, the quality of the partitions, unless very poor, has little influence on the quality of the mapping. <br />More importantly, one of our new mapping algorithms always yields the best results in terms of the quality measure maximum congestion when the application graphs are complex networks. In case of meshes as application graphs, this mapping algorithm always leads in terms of maximum congestion AND maximum dilation, another common quality measure.

010       Modeling Transitivity in Complex Networks
021       An important source of high clustering coefficient in real-world networks is transitivity. 
020       However, existing approaches for modeling transitivity suffer from at least one of the following problems: i) they produce graphs from a specific class like bipartite graphs, ii) they do not give an analytical argument for the high clustering coefficient of the model, and iii) their clustering coefficient is still significantly lower than real-world networks. In this paper, we propose a new model for complex networks which is based on adding transitivity to scale-free models. We theoretically analyze the model and provide analytical arguments for its different properties. In particular, we calculate a lower bound on the clustering coefficient of the model which is independent of the network size, as seen in real-world networks. More than theoretical analysis, the main properties of the model are evaluated empirically and it is shown that the model can precisely simulate real-world networks from different domains with and different specifications.

010       Multilayer stochastic block models reveal the multilayer structure of   complex networks
021       In complex systems, the network of interactions we observe between system's components is the aggregate of the interactions that occur through different mechanisms or layers. 
020       Recent studies reveal that the existence of multiple interaction layers can have a dramatic impact in the dynamical processes occurring on these systems. However, these studies assume that the interactions between systems components in each one of the layers are known, while typically for real-world systems we do not have that information. Here, we address the issue of uncovering the different interaction layers from aggregate data by introducing multilayer stochastic block models (SBMs), a generalization of single-layer SBMs that considers different mechanisms of layer aggregation. First, we find the complete probabilistic solution to the problem of finding the optimal multilayer SBM for a given aggregate observed network. Because this solution is computationally intractable, we propose an approximation that enables us to verify that multilayer SBMs are more predictive of network structure in real-world complex systems.

010       Multiplexity and multireciprocity in directed multiplexes
021       In the last few years, the study of multi-layer complex networks has received significant attention. 
020       In this work, we provide new measures to analyse dependencies between directed links in different layers of multiplex networks. We show that this requires more than a straightforward extension of the corresponding multiplexity measures that have been developed for undirected multiplexes. In particular, one should take into account the effects of reciprocity, i.e. the tendency of pairs of vertices to establish mutual connections. It is well known that reciprocity is a crucial property of many directed single-layer networks, affecting several dynamical processes taking place on such systems. Here we extend this quantity to directed multiplexes and introduce the notion of multireciprocity, defined as the tendency of links in one layer to be reciprocated by links in a different layer. We introduce multireciprocity measures valid for both binary and weighted networks and then validate these novel quantities on the World Trade Multiplex (WTM), representing the import-export bilateral relations between world countries in different commodities. We show that several pairs of layers exhibit strong multiplexity, an effect which can however be largely encoded into the degree or strength sequences of the various layers. Moreover, we find that most of the pairs of commodities are characterised by positive multireciprocities, even though such values are significantly lower than the usual reciprocity measured on the aggregated network. These results confirm that a multiplex approach to the phenomenon of reciprocity conveys much more information than the analysis of the aggregated network does.

010       Predicting future conflict between team-members with parameter-free   models of social networks
021       Despite the well-documented benefits of working in teams, teamwork also results in communication, coordination and management costs, and may lead to personal conflict between team members. 
020       In a context where teams play an increasingly important role, it is of major importance to understand conflict and to develop diagnostic tools to avert it. Here, we investigate empirically whether it is possible to quantitatively predict future conflict in small teams using parameter-free models of social network structure. We analyze data of conflict appearance and resolution between 86 team members in 16 small teams, all working in a real project for nine consecutive months. We find that group-based models of complex networks successfully anticipate conflict in small teams whereas micro-based models of structural balance, which have been traditionally used to model conflict, do not.

010       Multi-resolution community detection based on generalized self-loop   rescaling strategy
021       Community detection is of considerable importance for analyzing the structure and function of complex networks. 
020       Many real-world networks may possess community structures at multiple scales, and recently, various multi-resolution methods were proposed to identify the community structures at different scales. In this paper, we present a type of multi-resolution methods by using the generalized self-loop rescaling strategy. The self-loop rescaling strategy provides one uniform ansatz for the design of multi-resolution community detection methods. Many quality functions for community detection can be unified in the framework of the self-loop rescaling. The resulting multi-resolution quality functions can be optimized directly using the existing modularity-optimization algorithms. Several derived multi-resolution methods are applied to the analysis of community structures in several synthetic and real-world networks. The results show that these methods can find the pre-defined substructures in synthetic networks and real splits observed in real-world networks. Finally, we give a discussion on the methods themselves and their relationship. We hope that the study in the paper can be helpful for the understanding of the multi-resolution methods and provide useful insight into designing new community detection methods.

010       Structural limitations of learning in a crowd: communication   vulnerability and information diffusion in MOOCs
021       Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) bring together a global crowd of thousands of learners for several weeks or months. 
020       In theory, the openness and scale of MOOCs can promote iterative dialogue that facilitates group cognition and knowledge construction. Using data from two successive instances of a popular business strategy MOOC, we filter observed communication patterns to arrive at the "significant" interaction networks between learners and use complex network analysis to explore the vulnerability and information diffusion potential of the discussion forums. We find that different discussion topics and pedagogical practices promote varying levels of 1) "significant" peer-to-peer engagement, 2) participant inclusiveness in dialogue, and ultimately, 3) modularity, which impacts information diffusion to prevent a truly "global" exchange of knowledge and learning. These results indicate the structural limitations of large-scale crowd-based learning and highlight the different ways that learners in MOOCs leverage, and learn within, social contexts. We conclude by exploring how these insights may inspire new developments in online education.

010       Decremental All-Pairs ALL Shortest Paths and Betweenness Centrality
021       We consider the all pairs all shortest paths (APASP) problem, which maintains the shortest path dag rooted at every vertex in a directed graph G=(V,E) with positive edge weights. 
020       For this problem we present a decremental algorithm (that supports the deletion of a vertex, or weight increases on edges incident to a vertex). Our algorithm runs in amortized O(\vstar^2 \cdot \log n) time per update, where n=|V|, and \vstar bounds the number of edges that lie on shortest paths through any given vertex. Our APASP algorithm can be used for the decremental computation of betweenness centrality (BC), a graph parameter that is widely used in the analysis of large complex networks. No nontrivial decremental algorithm for either problem was known prior to our work. Our method is a generalization of the decremental algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano [DI04] for unique shortest paths, and for graphs with \vstar =O(n), we match the bound in [DI04]. Thus for graphs with a constant number of shortest paths between any pair of vertices, our algorithm maintains APASP and BC scores in amortized time O(n^2 \log n) under decremental updates, regardless of the number of edges in the graph.

010       Hierarchical and Matrix Structures in a Large Organizational Email   Network: Visualization and Modeling Approaches
021       This paper presents findings from a study of the email network of a large scientific research organization, focusing on methods for visualizing and modeling organizational hierarchies within large, complex network datasets. 
020       In the first part of the paper, we find that visualization and interpretation of complex organizational network data is facilitated by integration of network data with information on formal organizational divisions and levels. By aggregating and visualizing email traffic between organizational units at various levels, we derive several insights into how large subdivisions of the organization interact with each other and with outside organizations. Our analysis shows that line and program management interactions in this organization systematically deviate from the idealized pattern of interaction prescribed by "matrix management." In the second part of the paper, we propose a power law model for predicting degree distribution of organizational email traffic based on hierarchical relationships between managers and employees. This model considers the influence of global email announcements sent from managers to all employees under their supervision, and the role support staff play in generating email traffic, acting as agents for managers. We also analyze patterns in email traffic volume over the course of a work week.

010       Exact Analysis of Synchronizability for Complex Networks using Regular   Graphs
021       Network synchronization is an emerging phenomenon in complex networks. 
020       The spectrum of Laplacian matrix will be immensely helpful for getting the network dynamics information. Especially, network synchronizability is characterized by the ratio of second smallest eigen value to largest eigen value of the Laplacian matrix. We study the synchronization of complex networks modeled by regular graphs. We obtained the analytical expressions for network synchronizability for r-nearest neighbor cycle and r-nearest neighbor torus. We have also derived the generalized expression for synchronizability for m-dimensional r-nearest neigh- bor torus. The obtained analytical results agree with the simulation results and shown the effect of network dimension, number of nodes and overhead on syn- chronizability and connectivity in complex networks. This work provides the basic analytical tools for managing and controlling the synchronization in the fi- nite sized complex networks and also given the generalized expressions for eigen values of Laplacian matrix for multi dimensional r- nearest neighbor networks.

010       Critical behavior of the relaxation rate, the susceptibility, and a pair   correlation function in the Kuramoto model on scale-free networks
021       We study the impact of network heterogeneity on relaxation dynamics of the Kuramoto model on uncorrelated complex networks with scale-free degree distributions. 
020       Using the Ott-Antonsen method and the annealed-network approach, we find that the critical behavior of the relaxation rate near the synchronization phase transition does not depend on network heterogeneity and critical slowing down takes place at the critical point when the second moment of the degree distribution is finite. In the case of a complete graph we obtain an explicit result for the relaxation rate when the distribution of natural frequencies is Lorentzian. We also find a response of the Kuramoto model to an external field and show that the susceptibility of the model is inversely proportional to the relaxation rate. We reveal that network heterogeneity strongly impacts a field dependence of the relaxation rate and the susceptibility when the network has a divergent fourth moment of degree distribution. We introduce a pair correlation function of phase oscillators and show that it has a sharp peak at the critical point, signaling emergence of long-range correlations. Our numerical simulations of the Kuramoto model support our analytical results.

010       Predicting triadic closure in networks using communicability distance   functions
021       We propose a communication-driven mechanism for predicting triadic closure in complex networks. 
020       It is mathematically formulated on the basis of communicability distance functions that account for the "goodness" of communication between nodes in the network. We study $25$ real-world networks and show that the proposed method predicts correctly $20\%$ of triadic closures in these networks, in contrast to the $7.6\%$ predicted by a random mechanism. We also show that the communication-driven method outperforms the random mechanism in explaining the clustering coefficient, average path length, average communicability, and degree heterogeneity of a network. The new method also displays some interesting features toward its use for optimizing communication and degree heterogeneity in networks.

010       The lifespan method as a tool to study criticality in absorbing-state   phase transitions
021       In a recent work, a new numerical method (the lifespan method) has been introduced to study the critical properties of epidemic processes on complex networks [Phys. 
020       Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 068701 (2013)]. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the viability of this method for the study of the critical properties of generic absorbing-state phase transitions in lattices. Focusing on the well understood case of the contact process, we develop a finite-size scaling theory to measure the critical point and its associated critical exponents. We show the validity of the method by studying numerically the contact process on a one-dimensional lattice and comparing the findings of the lifespan method with the standard quasi-stationary method. We find that the lifespan method gives results that are perfectly compatible with those of quasi-stationary simulations and with analytical results. Our observations confirm that the lifespan method is a fully legitimate tool for the study of the critical properties of absorbing phase transitions in regular lattices.

020       Most of the existing struc- ture entropies are based on the degree or the betweenness centrality. In order to describe the structure property of the complex networks more reasonably, a new structure entropy of the complex networks based on the Tsallis nonextensive statistical mechanics is proposed in this paper. The influence of the degree and the betweenness centrality on the structure property is combined in the proposed structure entropy. Compared with the existing structure entropy, the proposed structure entropy is more reasonable to describe the structure property of the complex networks in some situations.

020       The constructed planar graph inherits several properties of the series in its structure. Thereby, periodic series, random series, and chaotic series convert into quite different networks with different average degree, characteristic path length, diameter, clustering coefficient, different degree distribution, and modularity, etc. By means of this new approach, with such different networks measures, one can characterize two dimensional timeseries from a new viewpoint of complex networks.

010       Tail-scope: Using friends to estimate heavy tails of degree   distributions in large-scale complex networks
021       Many complex networks in natural and social phenomena have often been characterized by heavy-tailed degree distributions. 
020       However, due to rapidly growing size of network data and concerns on privacy issues about using these data, it becomes more difficult to analyze complete data sets. Thus, it is crucial to devise effective and efficient estimation methods for heavy tails of degree distributions in large-scale networks only using local information of a small fraction of sampled nodes. Here we propose a tail-scope method based on local observational bias of the friendship paradox. We show that the tail-scope method outperforms the uniform node sampling for estimating heavy tails of degree distributions, while the opposite tendency is observed in the range of small degrees. In order to take advantages of both sampling methods, we devise the hybrid method that successfully recovers the whole range of degree distributions. Our tail-scope method shows how structural heterogeneities of large-scale complex networks can be used to effectively reveal the network structure only with limited local information.

010       Multilevel Hierarchical Kernel Spectral Clustering for Real-Life Large   Scale Complex Networks
021       Kernel spectral clustering corresponds to a weighted kernel principal component analysis problem in a constrained optimization framework. 
020       The primal formulation leads to an eigen-decomposition of a centered Laplacian matrix at the dual level. The dual formulation allows to build a model on a representative subgraph of the large scale network in the training phase and the model parameters are estimated in the validation stage. The KSC model has a powerful out-of-sample extension property which allows cluster affiliation for the unseen nodes of the big data network. In this paper we exploit the structure of the projections in the eigenspace during the validation stage to automatically determine a set of increasing distance thresholds. We use these distance thresholds in the test phase to obtain multiple levels of hierarchy for the large scale network. The hierarchical structure in the network is determined in a bottom-up fashion. We empirically showcase that real-world networks have multilevel hierarchical organization which cannot be detected efficiently by several state-of-the-art large scale hierarchical community detection techniques like the Louvain, OSLOM and Infomap methods. We show a major advantage our proposed approach i.e. the ability to locate good quality clusters at both the coarser and finer levels of hierarchy using internal cluster quality metrics on 7 real-life networks.

010       Growing Self-organized Design of Efficient and Robust Complex Networks
021       A self-organization of efficient and robust networks is important for a future design of communication or transportation systems, however both characteristics are incompatible in many real networks. 
020       Recently, it has been found that the robustness of onion-like structure with positive degree-degree correlations is optimal against intentional attacks. We show that, by biologically inspired copying, an onion-like network emerges in the incremental growth with functions of proxy access and reinforced connectivity on a space. The proposed network consists of the backbone of tree-like structure by copyings and the periphery by adding shortcut links between low degree nodes to enhance the connectivity. It has the fine properties of the statistically self-averaging unlike the conventional duplication-divergence model, exponential-like degree distribution without overloaded hubs, strong robustness against both malicious attacks and random failures, and the efficiency with short paths counted by the number of hops as mediators and by the Euclidean distances. The adaptivity to heal over and to recover the performance of networking is also discussed for a change of environment in such disasters or battlefields on a geographical map. These properties will be useful for a resilient and scalable infrastructure of network systems even in emergent situations or poor environments.

010       Efficient inference of overlapping communities in complex networks
021       We discuss two views on extending existing methods for complex network modeling which we dub the communities first and the networks first view, respectively. 
020       Inspired by the networks first view that we attribute to White, Boorman, and Breiger (1976)[1], we formulate the multiple-networks stochastic blockmodel (MNSBM), which seeks to separate the observed network into subnetworks of different types and where the problem of inferring structure in each subnetwork becomes easier. We show how this model is specified in a generative Bayesian framework where parameters can be inferred efficiently using Gibbs sampling. The result is an effective multiple-membership model without the drawbacks of introducing complex definitions of "groups" and how they interact. We demonstrate results on the recovery of planted structure in synthetic networks and show very encouraging results on link prediction performances using multiple-networks models on a number of real-world network data sets.

020       We find that, while subnetworks in which links have a positive connotation, such as endorsement and trust, are characterized by assortative mixing by degree, networks in which links have a negative connotation, such as disapproval and distrust, are characterized by disassortative patterns. We introduce a class of simple theoretical models to analyze the interplay between network topology and the superimposed structure based on the sign of links. Results uncover the conditions that underpin the emergence of the patterns observed in the data, namely the assortativity of positive subnetworks and the disassortativity of negative ones. We discuss the implications of our study for the analysis of signed complex networks.

010       Bootstrap percolation and the geometry of complex networks
021       We consider a geometric framework for complex networks that was proposed recently by Krioukov et al. 
020       [KPK+10]. This model is in fact a geometrization of the well-known Chung-Lu model, which is a type of inhomogeneous random graphs with kernel of rank 1. The model of Krioukov et al. is a special case of random geometric graphs on the hyperbolic plane and in fact the underlying hyperbolic geometry turns out to be the source of typical features that appear in complex networks such as power law degree distribution and clustering. In this paper, we consider the evolution of the classical bootstrap percolation process on this class of random graphs that have $N$ vertices and the tail of the degree distribution follows a power law with exponent between 2 and 3. Assuming that $p=p(N)$ is the initial infection rate, in each round of the process a vertex that is not infected but has at least $\mathbf{r} \geq 1$ infected neighbors becomes infected and stays so forever. We identify a critical function $p_c (N) = o(1)$ such that with high probability if $p \gg p_c (N)$, the infection spreads to a positive fraction of the vertices, whereas if $p \ll p_c(N)$ the process does not evolve. Furthermore, we show that this behavior is "robust" under random deletions of the edges. Our proofs also imply that the giant component of these random graphs is robust under random deletions and so is their $\mathbf{r}$-core (which is the maximum subgraph of minimum degree at least $\mathbf{r}$).

010       Opinion control in complex networks
021       In many instances of election, the electorate appears to be a composite of partisan and independent voters. 
020       Given that partisans are not likely to convert to a different party, a main goal for a party could be to mobilize independent voters toward the party with the help of strong leadership, mass media, partisans, and effects of peer-to-peer influence. Based on the exact solution of the classical voter model dynamics in the presence of perfectly partisan voters (i.e., zealots), we propose a computational method to maximize the share of the party in a social network of independent voters by pinning control strategy. The party, corresponding to the controller or zealots, optimizes the nodes to be controlled given the information about the connectivity of independent voters and the set of nodes that the opponent party controls. We show that controlling hubs is generally a good strategy, whereas the optimized strategy is even better. The superiority of the optimized strategy is particularly eminent when the independent voters are connected as directed rather than undirected networks.

010       Reciprocity in directed networks
021       Reciprocity is an important characteristic of directed networks and has been widely used in the modeling of World Wide Web, email, social, and other complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we take a statistical physics point of view and study the limiting entropy and free energy densities from the microcanonical ensemble, the canonical ensemble, and the grand canonical ensemble whose sufficient statistics are given by edge and reciprocal densities. The sparse case is also studied for the grand canonical ensemble. Extensions to more general reciprocal models including reciprocal triangle and star densities will likewise be discussed.

010       Robustness of networks with topologies of dependency links
021       The robustness of complex networks with dependencies has been studied in recent years. 
020       However, previous studies focused on the robustness of networks composed of dependency links without network topology. In this study, we will analyze the percolation properties of a realistic network model where dependency links follow certain network topology. We perform the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to show the critical effects of topology of dependency links on robustness of complex networks. For Erd\"os-R\'enyi (ER) connectivity network, we find that the system with dependency of RR topology is more vulnerable than system with dependency of ER topology. And RR-RR (i.e. random-regular (RR) network with dependency of RR topology) disintegrates in an abrupt transition. In particular, we find that the system of RR-ER shows different types of phase transitions. For system of different combinations, the type of percolation depends on the interaction between connectivity topology and dependency topology.

010       Generalization of Clustering Agreements and Distances for Overlapping   Clusters and Network Communities
021       A measure of distance between two clusterings has important applications, including clustering validation and ensemble clustering. 
020       Generally, such distance measure provides navigation through the space of possible clusterings. Mostly used in cluster validation, a normalized clustering distance, a.k.a. agreement measure, compares a given clustering result against the ground-truth clustering. Clustering agreement measures are often classified into two families of pair-counting and information theoretic measures, with the widely-used representatives of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), respectively. This paper sheds light on the relation between these two families through a generalization. It further presents an alternative algebraic formulation for these agreement measures which incorporates an intuitive clustering distance, which is defined based on the analogous between cluster overlaps and co-memberships of nodes in clusters. Unlike the original measures, it is easily extendable for different cases, including overlapping clusters and clusters of inter-related data for complex networks. These two extensions are, in particular, important in the context of finding clusters in social and information networks, a.k.a communities.

010       The density structure and star formation rate of non-isothermal   polytropic turbulence
021       The interstellar medium of galaxies is governed by supersonic turbulence, which likely controls the star formation rate (SFR) and the initial mass function (IMF). 
020       Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, with a wide range of Mach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some of these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is isothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm atomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases that are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations by modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state (EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density, P~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma-1). We use grid resolutions of 2048^3 cells and compare polytropic exponents Gamma=0.7 (soft EOS), Gamma=1 (isothermal EOS), and Gamma=5/3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal filaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma&lt;1, while Gamma&gt;1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution function (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a power-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma&gt;1. In contrast, the PDF becomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma&lt;=1. We derive and test a new density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This new relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it determines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We derive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of ~5 from Gamma=0.7 to Gamma=5/3.

010       Pattern formation in multiplex networks
021       The advances in understanding complex networks have generated increasing interest in dynamical processes occurring on them. 
020       Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.

010       Percolation of localized attack on complex networks
021       The robustness of complex networks against node failure and malicious attack has been of interest for decades, while most of the research has focused on random attack or hub-targeted attack. 
020       In many real-world scenarios, however, attacks are neither random nor hub-targeted, but localized, where a group of neighboring nodes in a network are attacked and fail. In this paper we develop a percolation framework to analytically and numerically study the robustness of complex networks against such localized attack. In particular, we investigate this robustness in Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi networks, random-regular networks, and scale-free networks. Our results provide insight into how to better protect networks, enhance cybersecurity, and facilitate the design of more robust infrastructures.

010       Emergent Complex Network Geometry
021       Networks are mathematical structures that are universally used to describe a large variety of complex systems such as the brain or the Internet. 
020       Characterizing the geometrical properties of these networks has become increasingly relevant for routing problems, inference and data mining. In real growing networks, topological, structural and geometrical properties emerge spontaneously from their dynamical rules. Nevertheless we still miss a model in which networks develop an emergent complex geometry. Here we show that a single two parameter network model, the growing geometrical network, can generate complex network geometries with non-trivial distribution of curvatures, combining exponential growth and small-world properties with finite spectral dimensionality. In one limit, the non-equilibrium dynamical rules of these networks can generate scale-free networks with clustering and communities, in another limit planar random geometries with non-trivial modularity. Finally we find that these properties of the geometrical growing networks are present in a large set of real networks describing biological, social and technological systems.

010       Hybrid recommendation methods in complex networks
021       We propose here two new recommendation methods, based on the appropriate normalization of already existing similarity measures, and on the convex combination of the recommendation scores derived from similarity between users and between objects. 
020       We validate the proposed measures on three relevant data sets, and we compare their performance with several recommendation systems recently proposed in the literature. We show that the proposed similarity measures allow to attain an improvement of performances of up to 20\% with respect to existing non-parametric methods, and that the accuracy of a recommendation can vary widely from one specific bipartite network to another, which suggests that a careful choice of the most suitable method is highly relevant for an effective recommendation on a given system. Finally, we studied how an increasing presence of random links in the network affects the recommendation scores, and we found that one of the two recommendation algorithms introduced here can systematically outperform the others in noisy data sets.

010       Fully Dynamic All Pairs All Shortest Paths
021       We consider the all pairs all shortest paths (APASP) problem, which maintains all of the multiple shortest paths for every vertex pair in a directed graph G=(V,E) with a positive real weight on each edge. 
020       We present a fully dynamic algorithm for this problem in which an update supports either weight increases or weight decreases on a subset of edges incident to a vertex. Our algorithm runs in amortized O(\vstar^2 \cdot \log^3 n) time per update, where n = |V|, and \vstar bounds the number of edges that lie on shortest paths through any single vertex. Our APASP algorithm leads to the same amortized bound for the fully dynamic computation of betweenness centrality (BC), which is a parameter widely used in the analysis of large complex networks. <br />Our method is a generalization and a variant of the fully dynamic algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano [DI04] for unique shortest path, and it builds on very recent work on decremental APASP [NPR14]. Our algorithm matches the fully dynamic amortized bound in [DI04] for graphs with unique shortest paths, though our method, and especially its analysis, are different.

010       Input Selection for Performance and Controllability of Structured Linear   Descriptor Systems
021       A common approach to controlling complex networks is to directly control a subset of input nodes, which then controls the remaining nodes via network interactions. 
020       While techniques have been proposed for selecting input nodes based on either performance metrics or controllability, a unifying approach based on joint consideration of performance and controllability is an open problem. In this paper, we develop a submodular optimization framework for selecting input nodes based on joint performance and controllability in structured linear descriptor systems. We develop our framework for arbitrary linear descriptor systems. In developing our framework, we first prove that selecting a minimum-size set of input nodes for controllability is a matroid intersection problem that can be solved in polynomial-time in the network size. We then prove that input selection to maximize a performance metric with controllability as a constraint is equivalent to maximizing a monotone submodular function with two matroid basis constraints, and derive efficient approximation algorithms with provable optimality bounds for input selection. Finally, we present a graph controllability index metric, which characterizes the largest controllable subgraph of a given complex network, and prove its submodular structure, leading to input selection algorithms that trade-off performance and controllability. We provide improved optimality guarantees for known systems such as strongly connected networks, consensus networks, networks of double integrators, and networks where all system parameters (e.g., link weights) are chosen independently and at random.

010       The Effect of Network-Topology to Propagation on Networks
021       We study the effect of the network topology to propagation phenomena on networks in this article. 
020       We do not assume any propagation model such as the contact process or SIR model\cite{Ker} because the study is only the consideratons of the purely topological effect, especially the effect of cycles of a network. To uncover universal properties independent of explicit propagation models is expected due to it. First of all, we introduce some indeces for propagation phenomena of a network. Second we introduce a concept of cycles with a little differences to usal cycles, which is called "STOC" in the body of this article. We find some analytic relations between thesm, STOC and some indeces. Moreover we can find the total number of STOCs in a network, analytically. This consideration leads to an extension of the celebrated "Euler's polyhedron formula", which is only applicable to planar graphs. This extended formula is applicable to any graphs. Last we estimate numerically the indeces and the number of STOCs based on the theoretical considerations for some complex networks and make some discussion on the effects of cycles in networks to propagation.

010       Local structure entropy of complex networks
021       Identifying influential nodes in the complex networks is of theoretical and practical significance. 
020       There are many methods are proposed to identify the influential nodes in the complex networks. In this paper, a local structure entropy which is based on the degree centrality and the statistical mechanics is proposed to identifying the influential nodes in the complex network. <br />In the definition of the local structure entropy, each node has a local network, the local structure entropy of each node is equal to the structure entropy of the local network. The main idea in the local structure entropy is try to use the influence of the local network to replace the node's influence on the whole network. <br />The influential nodes which are identified by the local structure entropy are the intermediate nodes in the network. The intermediate nodes which connect those nodes with a big value of degree. <br />We use the $Susceptible-Infective$ (SI) model to evaluate the performance of the influential nodes which are identified by the local structure entropy. In the SI model the nodes use as the source of infection. According to the SI model, the bigger the percentage of the infective nodes in the network the important the node to the whole networks. The simulation on four real networks show that the proposed method is efficacious and rationality to identify the influential nodes in the complex networks.

010       Reciprocity in Social Networks with Capacity Constraints
021       Directed links arise naturally in many social networks (and other complex networks), giving rise to directed graphs as basic topological models for these networks. 
020       Reciprocity is a key metric that has been used in the literature to compare different directed networks and provide "hints" about their structural properties. For example, by comparing the reciprocity of an observed social network with that of a random digraph generated with certain matching statistics, one can test whether reciprocated links in the observed social networks are likely produced via a random process or not. In this paper we argue that it is imperative to capture what is maximally achievable reciprocity, for an ensemble of digraphs satisfying the same set of constraints. In particular we study the problem of maximizing achievable reciprocity of digraphs with prescribed node in-degree and out-degree sequences, and show that the maximum reciprocity hinges crucially on the prescribed degree sequences, which may intuitively be interpreted as constraints on node "social bandwidth" capacities, thus impose fundamental limits on the achievable reciprocities. We present a partial characterization of digraphs that achieve maximum reciprocity. We also provide a simple upper bound on the maximum reciprocity and sufficient conditions for achieving the bound. We demonstrate that many real networks exhibit surprisingly high reciprocities that are fairly close to the upper bound. Our results imply that many users in these social networks are in a sense more "social" than as suggested by the (average) reciprocity metric in that they are more willing to reciprocate, subject to their "social bandwidth" constraints.

010       Overlapping Communities in Social Networks
021       Complex networks can be typically broken down into groups or modules. 
020       Discovering this "community structure" is an important step in studying the large-scale structure of networks. Many algorithms have been proposed for community detection and benchmarks have been created to evaluate their performance. Typically algorithms for community detection either partition the graph (non-overlapping communities) or find node covers (overlapping communities). <br />In this paper, we propose a particularly simple semi-supervised learning algorithm for finding out communities. In essence, given the community information of a small number of "seed nodes", the method uses random walks from the seed nodes to uncover the community information of the whole network. The algorithm runs in time $O(k \cdot m \cdot \log n)$, where $m$ is the number of edges; $n$ the number of links; and $k$ the number of communities in the network. In sparse networks with $m = O(n)$ and a constant number of communities, this running time is almost linear in the size of the network. Another important feature of our algorithm is that it can be used for either non-overlapping or overlapping communities. <br />We test our algorithm using the LFR benchmark created by Lancichinetti, Fortunato, and Radicchi specifically for the purpose of evaluating such algorithms. Our algorithm can compete with the best of algorithms for both non-overlapping and overlapping communities as found in the comprehensive study of Lancichinetti and Fortunato.

For each of them, the entropy, sum entropy and maximum entropy values are calculated.For each of them is also generated a network, in which the nodes are the nucleotides, dinucleotides or trinucleotides and its edges are estimated by observing the respective adjacency among them in the genomic sequence. In this way, it is generated three networks, for which measures of complex networks are extracted.These measures together with measures of information theory comprise a feature vector representing a genomic sequence. Thus, the feature vector is used for classification by methods such as SVM, MultiLayer Perceptron, J48, IBK, Naive Bayes and Random Forest in order to evaluate the proposed approach.It was adopted coding sequences, intergenic sequences and TSS (Transcriptional Starter Sites) as datasets, for which the better results were obtained by the Random Forest with 91.2%, followed by J48 with 89.1% and SVM with 84.8% of accuracy. These results indicate that the new approach of feature extraction has its value, reaching good levels of classification even considering only the genomic sequences, i.e., no other a priori knowledge about them is considered.

010       Improving Observability of Stochastic Complex Networks under the   Supervision of Cognitive Dynamic Systems
021       Much has been said about observability in system theory and control; however, it has been recently that observability in complex networks has seriously attracted the attention of researchers. 
020       This paper examines the state-of-the-art and discusses some issues raised due to "complexity" and "stochasticity". These unresolved issues call for a new practical methodology. For stochastic systems, a degree of observability may be defined and the observability problem is not a binary (i.e., yes-no) question anymore. Here, we propose to employ a goal-seeking system to play a supervisory role in the network. Hence, improving the degree of observability would be a valid objective for the supervisory system. Towards this goal, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the observation process by reconfiguring the sensory parts in the network. A cognitive dynamic system is suggested as a proper choice for the supervisory system. In this framework, the network itself is viewed as the environment with which the cognitive dynamic system interacts. Computer experiments confirm the potential of the proposed approach for addressing some of the issues raised in networks due to complexity and stochasticity.

010       Discovering and Predicting Temporal Patterns of WiFi-interactive Social   Populations
021       Extensive efforts have been devoted to characterizing the rich connectivity patterns among the nodes (components) of such complex networks (systems), and in the course of development of research in this area, people have been prompted to address on a fundamental question: How does the fascinating yet complex topological features of a network affect or determine the collective behavior and performance of the networked system? While elegant attempts to address this core issue have been made, for example, from the viewpoints of synchronization, epidemics, evolutionary cooperation, and the control of complex networks, theoretically or empirically, this widely concerned key question still remains open in the newly emergent field of network science. 
020       Such fruitful advances also push the desire to understand (mobile) social networks and characterize human social populations with the interdependent collective dynamics as well as the behavioral patterns. Nowadays, a great deal of digital technologies are unobtrusively embedded into the physical world of human daily activities, which offer unparalleled opportunities to explosively digitize human physical interactions, who is contacting with whom at what time. Such powerful technologies include the Bluetooth, the active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, wireless sensors and, more close to our interest in this paper, the WiFi technology. As a snapshot of the modern society, a university is in the coverage of WiFi signals, where the WiFi system records the digital access logs of the authorized WiFi users when they access the campus wireless services. Such WiFi access records, as the indirect proxy data, work as the effective proxy of a large-scale population's social interactions.

010       Temporal effects in trend prediction: identifying the most popular nodes   in the future
021       Prediction is an important problem in different science domains. 
020       In this paper, we focus on trend prediction in complex networks, i.e. to identify the most popular nodes in the future. Due to the preferential attachment mechanism in real systems, nodes' recent degree and cumulative degree have been successfully applied to design trend prediction methods. Here we took into account more detailed information about the network evolution and proposed a temporal-based predictor (TBP). The TBP predicts the future trend by the node strength in the weighted network with the link weight equal to its exponential aging. Three data sets with time information are used to test the performance of the new method. We find that TBP have high general accuracy in predicting the future most popular nodes. More importantly, it can identify many potential objects with low popularity in the past but high popularity in the future. The effect of the decay speed in the exponential aging on the results is discussed in detail.

010       Symmetries and self-similarity of many-body wavefunctions
021       This PhD thesis is dedicated to the study of the interplay between symmetries of quantum states and their self-similar properties. 
020       It consists of three connected threads of research: polynomial invariants for multiphoton states, visualization schemes for quantum many-body systems and a complex networks approach to quantum walks on a graph. <br />First, we study the problem of which many-photon states are equivalent up to the action of passive linear optics. We prove that it can be converted into the problem of equivalence of two permutation-symmetric states, not necessarily restricted to the same operation on all parties. We show that the problem can be formulated in terms of symmetries of complex polynomials of many variables, and provide two families of invariants, which are straightforward to compute and provide analytical results. <br />Second, we study a family of recursive visualization schemes for many-particle systems, for which we have coined the name 'qubism'. While all many-qudit states can be plotted with qubism, it is especially useful for spin chains and one-dimensional translationally invariant states. This symmetry results in self-similarity of the plot, making it more comprehensible and allowing to discover certain structures. <br />Third, we study quantum walks of a single particle on graphs, which are classical analogues of random walks. Our focus is on the long-time limit of the probability distribution and we study how (especially in the long-time limit) off-diagonal elements of the density matrix behave. We use them to perform quantum community detection - splitting of a graph into subgraphs in such a way that the coherence between them is small. Our method captures properties that classical methods cannot - the impact of constructive and destructive interference, as well as the dependence of the results on the tunneling phase.

010       Network Synchronization with Convexity
021       In this paper, we establish some new synchronization conditions for complex networks with nonlinear and nonidentical self-dynamics with switching directed communication graphs. 
020       In light of the recent works on distributed sub-gradient methods, we impose some integral convexity for the nonlinear node self-dynamics in the sense that the self-dynamics of a given node is the gradient of some concave function corresponding to that node. The node couplings are assumed to be linear but with switching directed communication graphs. Several sufficient and/or necessary conditions are established regarding exact or approximate synchronization over the considered complex networks. These results show when and how nonlinear node self-dynamics may cooperate with the linear consensus coupling, which eventually leads to network synchronization conditions under much relaxed connectivity requirements.

010       Chimera states in time-varying complex networks
021       Chimera states have been recently found in a variety of different coupling schemes and geometries. 
020       In most cases, the underlying coupling structure is considered to be static, while many realistic systems display significant temporal changes in the pattern of connectivity. In this work, we investigate a time-varying network made of two coupled populations of Kuramoto oscillators, where the links between the two groups are considered to vary over time. As a main result, we find that the network may support stable, breathing and alternating chimera states. We also find that, when the rate of connectivity changes is fast, compared to the oscillator dynamics, the network may be described by a low-dimensional system of equations. Unlike in the static heterogeneous case, the onset of alternating chimera states is due to the presence of fluctuations, which may be induced either by the finite size of the network or by large switching times.

010       Complex Networks as Nash Equilibria of Navigation Games
021       The common sense suggests that networks are not random mazes of purposeless connections, but that these connections are organised so that networks can perform their functions. 
020       One common function that many networks perform is targeted transport or navigation. Here with the help of game theory we show that minimalistic networks designed to maximise the navigation efficiency at minimal cost share basic structural properties of real networks. These idealistic networks are Nash equilibria of a network construction game whose purpose is to find an optimal trade-off between the network cost and navigability. They are navigation skeletons that we show are present in the Internet, {\it E. coli} metabolic network, English word network, US airport network, and the Hungarian road network. The knowledge of these skeletons allows one to identify the minimal number of edges by altering which one can dramatically improve or paralyse the navigation in the network.

010       A Framework for Evaluating Complex Networks Measurements
021       A good deal of current research in complex networks involves the characterization and/or classification of the topological properties of given structures, which has motivated several respective measurements. 
020       This letter proposes a framework for evaluating the quality of complex network measurements in terms of their effective resolution, degree of degeneracy and discriminability. The potential of the suggested approach is illustrated with respect to comparing the characterization of several model and real-world networks by using concentric and symmetry measurements. The results indicate a markedly superior performance for the latter type of mapping.

010       Communicability Angle and the Spatial Efficiency of Networks
021       We introduce the concept of communicability angle between a pair of nodes in a graph. 
020       We provide strong analytical and empirical evidence that the average communicability angle for a given network accounts for its spatial efficiency on the basis of the communications among the nodes in a network. We determine characteristics of the spatial efficiency of more than a hundred real-world complex networks that represent complex systems arising in a diverse set of scenarios. In particular, we find that the communicability angle correlates very well with the experimentally measured the relative packing efficiency of proteins that are represented as residue networks. We finally show how we can modulate the spatial efficiency of a network by tuning the weights of the edges of the networks. This allows us to predict effects of external stresses on the spatial efficiency of a network as well as to design strategies to improve important parameters in real-world complex systems.

010       Improving controllability of complex networks by rewiring links   regularly
021       Network science have constantly been in the focus of research for the last decade, with considerable advances in the controllability of their structural. 
020       However, much less effort has been devoted to study that how to improve the controllability of complex networks. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed to improve the controllability of complex networks by rewiring links regularly which transforms the network structure. Then it is demonstrated that our algorithm is very effective after numerical simulation experiment on typical network models (Erd\"os-R\'enyi and scale-free network). We find that our algorithm is mainly determined by the average degree and positive correlation of in-degree and out-degree of network and it has nothing to do with the network size. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the correlation between controllability of complex networks and degree distribution index: power-law exponent and heterogeneity

010       Probing the topological properties of complex networks modeling short   written texts
021       In recent years, graph theory has been widely employed to probe several language properties. 
020       More specifically, the so-called word adjacency model has been proven useful for tackling several practical problems, especially those relying on textual stylistic analysis. The most common approach to treat texts as networks has simply considered either large pieces of texts or entire books. This approach has certainly worked well -- many informative discoveries have been made this way -- but it raises an uncomfortable question: could there be important topological patterns in small pieces of texts? To address this problem, the topological properties of subtexts sampled from entire books was probed. Statistical analyzes performed on a dataset comprising 50 novels revealed that most of the traditional topological measurements are stable for short subtexts. When the performance of the authorship recognition task was analyzed, it was found that a proper sampling yields a discriminability similar to the one found with full texts. Surprisingly, the support vector machine classification based on the characterization of short texts outperformed the one performed with entire books. These findings suggest that a local topological analysis of large documents might improve its global characterization. Most importantly, it was verified, as a proof of principle, that short texts can be analyzed with the methods and concepts of complex networks. As a consequence, the techniques described here can be extended in a straightforward fashion to analyze texts as time-varying complex networks.

010       Fast and accurate determination of modularity and its effect size
021       We present a fast spectral algorithm for community detection in complex networks. 
020       Our method searches for the partition with the maximum value of the modularity via the interplay of several refinement steps that include both agglomeration and division. We validate the accuracy of the algorithm by applying it to several real-world benchmark networks. On all these, our algorithm performs as well or better than any other known polynomial scheme. This allows us to extensively study the modularity distribution in ensembles of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks, producing theoretical predictions for means and variances inclusive of finite-size corrections. Our work provides a way to accurately estimate the effect size of modularity, providing a $z$-score measure of it and enabling a more informative comparison of networks with different numbers of nodes and links.

010       Nucleation of a three-state spin model on complex networks
021       We study the metastability and nucleation of the Blume-Capel model on complex networks, in which each node can take one of three possible spin variables $\left\{ {-1, 0, 1} \right\}$. 
020       We consider the external magnetic field $h$ to be positive, and let the chemical potential $\lambda$ vary between $-h$ and $h$ in a low temperature, such that the $1$ configuration is stable, and $-1$ configuration and/or $0$ configuration are metastable. Combining the heterogeneous mean-field theory with simulations, we show that there exist four regions with distinct nucleation scenarios depending on the values of $h$ and $\lambda$: the system undergoes a two-step nucleation process from $-1$ configuration to $0$ configuration and then to $1$ configuration (region I); nucleation becomes a one-step process without an intermediate metastable configuration directly from $-1$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(1)) or directly from $0$ configuration to $1$ configuration (region II(2)) depending on the sign of $\lambda$; the metastability of the system vanishes and nucleation is thus irrelevant (region III). Furthermore, we show that in the region I nucleation rates for each step intersect that results in the occurrence of a maximum in the total nucleation rate.

010       Quantitative Function and Algorithm for Community Detection in Bipartite   Networks
021       Community detection in complex networks is a topic of high interest in many fields. 
020       Bipartite networks are a special type of complex networks in which nodes are decomposed into two disjoint sets, and only nodes between the two sets can be connected. Bipartite networks represent diverse interaction patterns in many real-world systems, such as predator-prey networks, plant-pollinator networks, and drug-target networks. While community detection in unipartite networks has been extensively studied in the past decade, identification of modules or communities in bipartite networks is still in its early stage. Several quantitative functions proposed for evaluating the quality of bipartite network divisions are based on null models and have distinct resolution limits. In this paper, we propose a new quantitative function for community detection in bipartite networks, and demonstrate that this quantitative function is superior to the widely used Barber's bipartite modularity and other functions. Based on the new quantitative function, the bipartite network community detection problem is formulated into an integer programming model. Bipartite networks can be partitioned into reasonable overlapping communities by maximizing the quantitative function. We further develop a heuristic and adapted label propagation algorithm (BiLPA) to optimize the quantitative function in large-scale bipartite networks. BiLPA does not require any prior knowledge about the number of communities in the networks. We apply BiLPA to both artificial networks and real-world networks and demonstrate that this method can successfully identify the community structures of bipartite networks.

010       Evidential Communities for Complex Networks
021       Community detection is of great importance for understand-ing graph structure in social networks. 
020       The communities in real-world networks are often overlapped, i.e. some nodes may be a member of multiple clusters. How to uncover the overlapping communities/clusters in a complex network is a general problem in data mining of network data sets. In this paper, a novel algorithm to identify overlapping communi-ties in complex networks by a combination of an evidential modularity function, a spectral mapping method and evidential c-means clustering is devised. Experimental results indicate that this detection approach can take advantage of the theory of belief functions, and preforms good both at detecting community structure and determining the appropri-ate number of clusters. Moreover, the credal partition obtained by the proposed method could give us a deeper insight into the graph structure.

010       Braess like Paradox on Ladder Network
021       Braess \cite{1} has been studied about a traffic flow on a diamond type network and found that introducing new edges to the networks always does not achieve the efficiency. 
020       Some researchers studied the Braess' paradox in similar type networks by introducing various types of cost functions. But whether such paradox occurs or not is not scarcely studied in complex networks except for Dorogovtsev-Mendes network\cite{2}. In this article, we study the paradox on Ladder type networks, as the first step to the research about Braess' paradox on Watts and Strogatz type small world network\cite{Watt1}\cite{Watt2}. %We theoretically and numerically studied Braess' paradox on Ladder networks. For the purpose, we construct $4 \times 3$ models as extensions of the original Braess' models. We analyze theoretically and numerically studied the models on Ladder networks. Last we give a phase diagram for (a) model, where the cost functions of bypasses are constant =0 or flow, base on two parameters $r$ and $p$ by numerical simulations. Simulation experiments also show some conditions that paradox can not occur. These facts give some sugestions for designing effective transportation networks.

010       Context dependent preferential attachment model for complex networks
021       In this paper, we propose a growing random complex network model, which we call context dependent preferential attachment model (CDPAM), when the preference of a new node to get attached to old nodes is determined by the local and global property of the old nodes. 
020       We consider that local and global properties of a node as the degree and relative average degree of the node respectively. We prove that the degree distribution of complex networks generated by CDPAM follow power law with exponent lies in the interval [2, 3] and the expected diameter grows logarithmically with the size of new nodes added in the initial small network. Numerical results show that the expected diameter stabilizes when alike weights to the local and global properties are assigned by the new nodes. Computing various measures including clustering coefficient, assortativity, number of triangles, algebraic connectivity, spectral radius, we show that the proposed model replicates properties of real networks better than BA model for all these measures when alike weights are given to local and global property. Finally, we observe that the BA model is a limiting case of CDPAM when new nodes tend to give large weight to the local property compared to the weight given to the global property during link formation.

010       Fast generation of complex networks with underlying hyperbolic geometry
021       Complex networks have become increasingly popular for modeling various real-world phenomena. 
020       Realistic generative network models are important in this context as they avoid privacy concerns of real data and simplify complex network research regarding data sharing, reproducibility, and scalability studies. \emph{Random hyperbolic graphs} are a well-analyzed family of geometric graphs. Previous work provided empirical and theoretical evidence that this generative graph model creates networks with non-vanishing clustering and other realistic features. However, the investigated networks in previous applied work were small, possibly due to the quadratic running time of a previous generator. <br />In this work we provide the first generation algorithm for these networks with subquadratic running time. We prove a time complexity of $O((n^{3/2}+m) \log n)$ with high probability for the generation process. This running time is confirmed by experimental data with our implementation. The acceleration stems primarily from the reduction of pairwise distance computations through a polar quadtree, which we adapt to hyperbolic space for this purpose. In practice we improve the running time of a previous implementation by at least two orders of magnitude this way. Networks with billions of edges can now be generated in a few minutes. <br />Finally, we evaluate the largest networks of this model published so far. Our empirical analysis shows that important features are retained over different graph densities and degree distributions.

010       Ricci Curvature of the Internet Topology
021       Analysis of Internet topologies has shown that the Internet topology has negative curvature, measured by Gromov's "thin triangle condition", which is tightly related to core congestion and route reliability. 
020       In this work we analyze the discrete Ricci curvature of the Internet, defined by Ollivier, Lin, etc. Ricci curvature measures whether local distances diverge or converge. It is a more local measure which allows us to understand the distribution of curvatures in the network. We show by various Internet data sets that the distribution of Ricci cuvature is spread out, suggesting the network topology to be non-homogenous. We also show that the Ricci curvature has interesting connections to both local measures such as node degree and clustering coefficient, global measures such as betweenness centrality and network connectivity, as well as auxilary attributes such as geographical distances. These observations add to the richness of geometric structures in complex network theory.

010       Robust Reconstruction of Complex Networks from Sparse Data
021       Reconstructing complex networks from measurable data is a fundamental problem for understanding and controlling collective dynamics of complex networked systems. 
020       However, a significant challenge arises when we attempt to decode structural information hidden in limited amounts of data accompanied by noise and in the presence of inaccessible nodes. Here, we develop a general framework for robust reconstruction of complex networks from sparse and noisy data. Specifically, we decompose the task of reconstructing the whole network into recovering local structures centered at each node. Thus, the natural sparsity of complex networks ensures a conversion from the local structure reconstruction into a sparse signal reconstruction problem that can be addressed by using the lasso, a convex optimization method. We apply our method to evolutionary games, transportation and communication processes taking place in a variety of model and real complex networks, finding that universal high reconstruction accuracy can be achieved from sparse data in spite of noise in time series and missing data of partial nodes. Our approach opens new routes to the network reconstruction problem and has potential applications in a wide range of fields.

010       Mapping the $q$-voter model: From a single chain to complex networks
021       We propose and compare six different ways of mapping the $q$-voter model to complex networks. 
020       Considering square lattices, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz and real Twitter networks, we ask the question whether a particular choice of the influence group of a fixed size $q$ leads to different behavior on the macroscopic level. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that the answer depends strongly on the relative average path length of the network and for real-life topologies the differences between the considered mappings may be negligible.

010       Memory and burstiness in dynamic networks
021       We introduce a class of complex network models which evolve through the addition of edges between nodes selected randomly according to their intrinsic fitness, and the deletion of edges according to their age. 
020       We add to this a memory effect where the attractiveness of a node is increased by the number of edges it is currently attached to, and observe that this creates burst-like activity in the attachment events of each individual node which is characterised by a power-law distribution of inter-event times. The fitness of each node depends on the probability distribution from which it is drawn; we find exact solutions for the expectation of the degree distribution for a variety of possible fitness distributions, and for both cases where the memory effect either is, or is not present. This work can potentially lead to methods to uncover hidden fitness distributions from fast changing, temporal network data such as online social communications and fMRI scans.

010       Network Analysis in the Legal Domain: A complex model for European Union   legal sources
021       Legislators, designers of legal information systems, as well as citizens face often problems due to the interdependence of the laws and the growing number of references needed to interpret them. 
020       Quantifying this complexity is not an easy task. In this paper, we introduce the "Legislation Network" as a novel approach to address related problems. We have collected an extensive data set of a more than 60-year old legislation corpus, as published in the Official Journal of the European Union, and we further analysed it as a complex network, thus gaining insight into its topological structure. Among other issues, we have performed a temporal analysis of the evolution of the Legislation Network, as well as a robust resilience test to assess its vulnerability under specific cases that may lead to possible breakdowns. Results are quite promising, showing that our approach can lead towards an enhanced explanation in respect to the structure and evolution of legislation properties.

010       Tsallis entropy of complex networks
021       How complex of the complex networks has attracted many researchers to explore it. 
020       The entropy is an useful method to describe the degree of the $complex$ of the complex networks. In this paper, a new method which is based on the Tsallis entropy is proposed to describe the $complex$ of the complex networks. The results in this paper show that the complex of the complex networks not only decided by the structure property of the complex networks, but also influenced by the relationship between each nodes. In other word, which kinds of nodes are chosen as the main part of the complex networks will influence the value of the entropy of the complex networks. The value of q in the Tsallis entropy of the complex networks is used to decided which kinds of nodes will be chosen as the main part in the complex networks. The proposed Tsallis entropy of the complex networks is a generalised method to describe the property of the complex networks.

010       Numerical Investigation of Graph Spectra and Information   Interpretability of Eigenvalues
021       We undertake an extensive numerical investigation of the graph spectra of thousands regular graphs, a set of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs, the two most popular types of complex networks and an evolving genetic network by using novel conceptual and experimental tools. 
020       Our objective in so doing is to contribute to an understanding of the meaning of the Eigenvalues of a graph relative to its topological and information-theoretic properties. We introduce a technique for identifying the most informative Eigenvalues of evolving networks by comparing graph spectra behavior to their algorithmic complexity. We suggest that extending techniques can be used to further investigate the behavior of evolving biological networks. In the extended version of this paper we apply these techniques to seven tissue specific regulatory networks as static example and network of a na\"ive pluripotent immune cell in the process of differentiating towards a Th17 cell as evolving example, finding the most and least informative Eigenvalues at every stage.

010       Locating the source of spreading in complex networks
021       Locating the sources that trigger a dynamical process is a fundamental but challenging problem in complex networks, ranging from epidemic spreading in society and on the Internet to cancer metastasis in the human body. 
020       An accurate localization of the source is inherently limited by our ability to simultaneously access the information of all nodes in a large-scale complex network, such as the time at which each individual is infected in a large population. This thus raises two critical questions: how do we locate the source from incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of sources at any possible location from a given set of observers. Here we develop an efficient algorithm to locate the source of a diffusion-like process and propose a general locatability condition. We test the algorithm by employing epidemic spreading and consensus dynamics as typical dynamical processes and apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in China. We find that the sources can be precisely located in arbitrary networks insofar as the locatability condition is assured. Our tools greatly improve our ability to locate the source of diffusion in complex networks based on limited accessibility of nodal information. Moreover they have implications for controlling a variety of dynamical processes taking place on complex networks, such as inhibiting epidemics, slowing the spread of rumors, and eliminating cancer seed cells in the human body.

010       Fast and asymptotic computation of the fixation probability for Moran   processes on graphs
021       Evolutionary dynamics has been classically studied for homogeneous populations, but now there is a growing interest in the non-homogenous case. 
020       One of the most important models has been proposed by Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak, adapting to a weighted directed graph the classical process described by Moran. The Markov chain associated with the graph can be modified by erasing all non-trivial loops in its state space, obtaining the so-called Embedded Markov chain (EMC). The fixation probability remains unchanged, but the expected time to absorption (fixation or extinction) is reduced. In this paper, we shall use this idea to compute asymptotically the average fixation probability for complete bipartite graphs. To this end, we firstly review some recent results on evolutionary dynamics on graphs trying to clarify some points. We also revisit the 'Star Theorem' proved by Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak for the star graphs. Theoretically, EMC techniques allow fast computation of the fixation probability, but in practice this is not always true. Thus, in the last part of the paper, we compare this algorithm with the standard Monte Carlo method for some kind of complex networks.

010       Comparative analysis of existing models for power-grid synchronization
021       The dynamics of power-grid networks is becoming an increasingly active area of research within the physics and network science communities. 
020       The results from such studies are typically insightful and illustrative, but are often based on simplifying assumptions that can be either difficult to assess or not fully justified for realistic applications. Here we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of three leading models recently used to study synchronization dynamics in power-grid networks -- a fundamental problem of practical significance given that frequency synchronization of all power generators in the same interconnection is a necessary condition for a power grid to operate. We show that each of these models can be derived from first principles within a common framework based on the classical model of a generator, thereby clarifying all assumptions involved. This framework allows us to view power grids as complex networks of coupled second-order phase oscillators with both forcing and damping terms. Using simple illustrative examples, test systems, and real power-grid datasets, we study the inherent frequencies of the oscillators as well as their coupling structure, comparing across the different models. We demonstrate, in particular, that if the network structure is not homogeneous, generators with identical parameters need to be modeled as non-identical oscillators in general. We also discuss an approach to estimate the required (dynamical) parameters that are unavailable in typical power-grid datasets, their use for computing the constants of each of the three models, and an open-source MATLAB toolbox that we provide for these computations.

010       A cluster in the making: ALMA reveals the initial conditions for   high-mass cluster formation
021       G0.253+0.016 is a molecular clump that appears to be on the verge of forming a high mass, Arches-like cluster. 
020       Here we present new ALMA observations of its small-scale (~0.07 pc) 3mm dust continuum and molecular line emission. The data reveal a complex network of emission features, the morphology of which ranges from small, compact regions to extended, filamentary structures that are seen in both emission and absorption. The dust column density is well traced by molecules with higher excitation energies and critical densities, consistent with a clump that has a denser interior. A statistical analysis supports the idea that turbulence shapes the observed gas structure within G0.253+0.016. We find a clear break in the turbulent power spectrum derived from the optically thin dust continuum emission at a spatial scale of ~0.1 pc, which may correspond to the spatial scale at which gravity has overcome the thermal pressure. We suggest that G0.253+0.016 is on the verge of forming a cluster from hierarchical, filamentary structures that arise from a highly turbulent medium. Although the stellar distribution within Arches-like clusters is compact, centrally condensed and smooth, the observed gas distribution within G0.253+0.016 is extended, with no high-mass central concentration, and has a complex, hierarchical structure. If this clump gives rise to a high-mass cluster and its stars are formed from this initially hierarchical gas structure, then the resulting cluster must evolve into a centrally condensed structure via a dynamical process.

010       Sequential Defense Against Random and Intentional Attacks in Complex   Networks
021       Network robustness against attacks is one of the most fundamental researches in network science as it is closely associated with the reliability and functionality of various networking paradigms. 
020       However, despite the study on intrinsic topological vulnerabilities to node removals, little is known on the network robustness when network defense mechanisms are implemented, especially for networked engineering systems equipped with detection capabilities. In this paper, a sequential defense mechanism is firstly proposed in complex networks for attack inference and vulnerability assessment, where the data fusion center sequentially infers the presence of an attack based on the binary attack status reported from the nodes in the network. The network robustness is evaluated in terms of the ability to identify the attack prior to network disruption under two major attack schemes, i.e., random and intentional attacks. We provide a parametric plug-in model for performance evaluation on the proposed mechanism and validate its effectiveness and reliability via canonical complex network models and real-world large-scale network topology. The results show that the sequential defense mechanism greatly improves the network robustness and mitigates the possibility of network disruption by acquiring limited attack status information from a small subset of nodes in the network.

020       In this paper a new form of the local structure entropy of the complex networks is proposed based on the Tsallis entropy. The value of the entropic index $q$ will influence the property of the local structure entropy. When the value of $q$ is equal to 0, the nonextensive local structure entropy is degenerated to a new form of the degree centrality. When the value of $q$ is equal to 1, the nonextensive local structure entropy is degenerated to the existing form of the local structure entropy. We also have find a nonextensive threshold value in the nonextensive local structure entropy. When the value of $q$ is bigger than the nonextensive threshold value, change the value of $q$ will has no influence on the property of the local structure entropy, and different complex networks have different nonextensive threshold value. <br />The results in this paper show that the new nonextensive local structure entropy is a generalised of the local structure entropy. It is more reasonable and useful than the existing one.

010       Defining Least Community as a Homogeneous Group in Complex Networks
021       This paper introduces a new concept of least community that is as homogeneous as a random graph, and develops a new community detection algorithm from the perspective of homogeneity or heterogeneity. 
020       Based on this concept, we adopt head/tail breaks - a newly developed classification scheme for data with a heavy-tailed distribution - and rely on edge betweenness given its heavy-tailed distribution to iteratively partition a network into many heterogeneous and homogeneous communities. Surprisingly, the derived communities for any self-organized and/or self-evolved large networks demonstrate very striking power laws, implying that there are far more small communities than large ones. This notion of far more small things than large ones constitutes a new fundamental way of thinking for community detection.

010       Complex networks vulnerability to module-based attacks
021       In the multidisciplinary field of Network Science, optimization of procedures for efficiently breaking complex networks is attracting much attention from practical points of view. 
020       In this contribution we present a module-based method to efficiently break complex networks. The procedure first identifies the communities in which the network can be represented, then it deletes the nodes (edges) that connect different modules by its order in the betweenness centrality ranking list. We illustrate the method by applying it to various well known examples of social, infrastructure, and biological networks. We show that the proposed method always outperforms vertex (edge) attacks which are based on the ranking of node (edge) degree or centrality, with a huge gain in efficiency for some examples. Remarkably, for the US power grid, the present method breaks the original network of 4941 nodes to many fragments smaller than 197 nodes (4% of the original size) by removing mere 164 nodes (~3%) identified by the procedure. By comparison, any degree or centrality based procedure, deleting the same amount of nodes, removes only 22% of the original network, i.e. more than 3800 nodes continue to be connected after that

The nodes which have a high influential to others always have a small value of similarity to other nodes and the marginal nodes also have a low similar to other nodes. The results in this paper show that the proposed method is useful and reasonable to measure the similarity of the nodes in the complex networks.

010       Authorship recognition via fluctuation analysis of network topology and   word intermittency
021       Statistical methods have been widely employed in many practical natural language processing applications. 
020       More specifically, complex networks concepts and methods from dynamical systems theory have been successfully applied to recognize stylistic patterns in written texts. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a few studies have assessed the relevance of attributes derived from the analysis of stylistic fluctuations. Because fluctuations represent a pivotal factor for characterizing a myriad of real systems, this study focused on the analysis of the properties of stylistic fluctuations in texts via topological analysis of complex networks and intermittency measurements. The results showed that different authors display distinct fluctuation patterns. In particular, it was found that it is possible to identify the authorship of books using the intermittency of specific words. Taken together, the results described here suggest that the patterns found in stylistic fluctuations could be used to analyze other related complex systems. Furthermore, the discovery of novel patterns related to textual stylistic fluctuations indicates that these patterns could be useful to improve the state of the art of many stylistic-based natural language processing tasks.

010       Assessing the direction of climate interactions by means of complex   networks and information theoretic tools
021       An estimate of the net direction of climate interactions in different geographical regions is made by constructing a directed climate network from a regular latitude-longitude grid of nodes, using a directionality index (DI) based on conditional mutual information. 
020       Two datasets of surface air temperature anomalies - one monthly-averaged and another daily-averaged - are analyzed and compared. The network links are interpreted in terms of known atmospheric tropical and extratropical variability patterns. Specific and relevant geographical regions are selected, the net direction of propagation of the atmospheric patterns is analyzed and the direction of the inferred links is validated by recovering some well-known climate variability structures. These patterns are found to be acting at various time-scales, such as atmospheric waves in the extra-tropics or longer range events in the tropics. This analysis demonstrates the capability of the DI measure to infer the net direction of climate interactions and may contribute to improve the present understanding of climate phenomena and climate predictability. The work presented here also stands out as an application of advanced tools to the analysis of empirical, real-world data.

010       Optimal Relay Selection with Non-negligible Probing Time
021       In this paper an optimal relay selection algorithm with non-negligible probing time is proposed and analyzed for cooperative wireless networks. 
020       Relay selection has been introduced to solve the degraded bandwidth efficiency problem in cooperative communication. Yet complete information of relay channels often remain unavailable for complex networks which renders the optimal selection strategies impossible for transmission source without probing the relay channels. Particularly when the number of relay candidate is large, even though probing all relay channels guarantees the finding of the best relays at any time instant, the degradation of bandwidth efficiency due to non-negligible probing times, which was often neglected in past literature, is also significant. In this work, a stopping rule based relay selection strategy is determined for the source node to decide when to stop the probing process and choose one of the probed relays to cooperate with under wireless channels' stochastic uncertainties. This relay selection strategy is further shown to have a simple threshold structure. At the meantime, full diversity order and high bandwidth efficiency can be achieved simultaneously. Both analytical and simulation results are provided to verify the claims.

010       A Distributed Tracking Algorithm for Reconstruction of Graph Signals
021       The rapid development of signal processing on graphs provides a new perspective for processing large-scale data associated with irregular domains. 
020       In many practical applications, it is necessary to handle massive data sets through complex networks, in which most nodes have limited computing power. Designing efficient distributed algorithms is critical for this task. This paper focuses on the distributed reconstruction of a time-varying bandlimited graph signal based on observations sampled at a subset of selected nodes. A distributed least square reconstruction (DLSR) algorithm is proposed to recover the unknown signal iteratively, by allowing neighboring nodes to communicate with one another and make fast updates. DLSR uses a decay scheme to annihilate the out-of-band energy occurring in the reconstruction process, which is inevitably caused by the transmission delay in distributed systems. Proof of convergence and error bounds for DLSR are provided in this paper, suggesting that the algorithm is able to track time-varying graph signals and perfectly reconstruct time-invariant signals. The DLSR algorithm is numerically experimented with synthetic data and real-world sensor network data, which verifies its ability in tracking slowly time-varying graph signals.

010       Transient coupling relationships of the Holocene Australian monsoon
021       The modern-day northwest Australian summer monsoon is dynamically coupled to other regional monsoon systems and inflows from the Indian Ocean, however, the nature of these relationships over longer time scales is uncertain. 
020       Previous attempts to evaluate how proxy records from the Indonesian-Australian monsoon region correspond to other records from the Indian and East Asian monsoon regions, as well as to El Ni\~no-related proxy records, has been qualitative, relying on `curve-fitting' methods. Here, we seek a quantitative approach for identifying coupling relationships between paleoclimate proxy records, employing statistical techniques to compute the interdependence of two paleoclimate time series. We verify the use of complex networks to identify coupling relationships between modern climate indices which correspond to physically-based mechanisms. This method is then extended to a set of paleoclimate proxy records from the Asian, Australasian and South American regions spanning the past 9,000 years. The resulting networks demonstrate the existence of coupling relationships between regional monsoon systems on millennial time scales, but also highlight the transient nature of teleconnections during this period. In the context of the northwest Australian summer monsoon, we recognise a shift in coupling relationships from strong interhemispheric links with East Asian monsoon proxy records, as well as those possibly related to ITCZ positioning, in the mid-Holocene to significantly weaker coupling in the later Holocene. Although the identified links cannot explain the underlying physical processes leading to coupling between regional monsoon systems, this method provides a step towards understanding the role that changes in teleconnections play in millennial- to orbital-scale climate variability.

010       A general framework for the recurrence network analysis of chaotic time   series
021       We propose a novel approach for the construction and analysis of unweighted $\epsilon$ - recurrence networks from chaotic time series. 
020       In contrast to the existing schemes, the selection of the optimum value of the threshold $\epsilon$ in our scheme is done empirically. We show that the range of $\epsilon$ values that we choose for each embedding dimension $M$ map the optimum information from the time series to the constructed network and this range is approximately the same for all the standard low dimensional chaotic systems. This provides us a general framework for non-subjective comparison of the measures derived from the recurrence networks of various chaotic attractors. By using the optimum recurrence network constructed in this way, we compute all the important statistical measures associated with the underlying attractor as function of $M$ and the number of nodes $N$. We show explicitly that the degree distribution of the optimum recurrence network from a chaotic attractor is a characteristic measure of the structure of the attractor and display statistical scale invariance with respect to increase in $N$. The practical utility of our scheme is also made clear by applying it to a time series from the real world. Finally, we look at the recurrence network from a complex network perspective by comparing its properties with that of a synthetically generated scale free network.

010       Inherent directionality explains the lack of feedback loops in empirical   networks
021       We explore the hypothesis that the relative abundance of feedback loops in many empirical complex networks is severely reduced owing to the presence of an inherent global directionality. 
020       Aimed at quantifying this idea, we propose a simple probabilistic model in which a free parameter $\gamma$ controls the degree of inherent directionality. Upon strengthening such directionality, the model predicts a drastic reduction in the fraction of loops which are also feedback loops. To test this prediction, we extensively enumerated loops and feedback loops in many empirical biological, ecological and socio- technological directed networks. We show that, in almost all cases, empirical networks have a much smaller fraction of feedback loops than network randomizations. Quite remarkably, this empirical finding is quantitatively reproduced, for all loop lengths, by our model by fitting its only parameter $\gamma$. Moreover, the fitted value of $\gamma$ correlates quite well with another direct measurement of network directionality, performed by means of a novel algorithm. We conclude that the existence of an inherent network directionality provides a parsimonious quantitative explanation for the observed lack of feedback loops in empirical networks.

020       The multiplex network study is one of the newest and hottest themes in the statistical physics of complex networks. Pioneering studies have proven that the multiplexity has broad impact on the system's structure and function. In this Colloquium paper, we present an organized review of the growing body of current literature on multiplex networks by categorizing existing studies broadly according to the type of layer coupling in the problem. Major recent advances in the ?field are surveyed and some outstanding open challenges and future perspectives will be proposed.

010       Exploring Hierarchies in Online Social Networks
021       Social hierarchy (i.e., pyramid structure of societies) is a fundamental concept in sociology and social network analysis. 
020       The importance of social hierarchy in a social network is that the topological structure of the social hierarchy is essential in both shaping the nature of social interactions between individuals and unfolding the structure of the social networks. The social hierarchy found in a social network can be utilized to improve the accuracy of link prediction, provide better query results, rank web pages, and study information flow and spread in complex networks. In this paper, we model a social network as a directed graph G, and consider the social hierarchy as DAG (directed acyclic graph) of G, denoted as GD. By DAG, all the vertices in G can be partitioned into different levels, the vertices at the same level represent a disjoint group in the social hierarchy, and all the edges in DAG follow one direction. The main issue we study in this paper is how to find DAG GD in G. The approach we take is to find GD by removing all possible cycles from G such that G = U(G) + GD where U(G) is a maximum Eulerian subgraph which contains all possible cycles. We give the reasons for doing so, investigate the properties of GD found, and discuss the applications. In addition, we develop a novel two-phase algorithm, called Greedy-&amp;-Refine, which greedily computes an Eulerian subgraph and then refines this greedy solution to find the maximum Eulerian subgraph. We give a bound between the greedy solution and the optimal. The quality of our greedy approach is high. We conduct comprehensive experimental studies over 14 real-world datasets. The results show that our algorithms are at least two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

010       Random Walks, Markov Processes and the Multiscale Modular Organization   of Complex Networks
021       Most methods proposed to uncover communities in complex networks rely on combinatorial graph properties. 
020       Usually an edge-counting quality function, such as modularity, is optimized over all partitions of the graph compared against a null random graph model. Here we introduce a systematic dynamical framework to design and analyze a wide variety of quality functions for community detection. The quality of a partition is measured by its Markov Stability, a time-parametrized function defined in terms of the statistical properties of a Markov process taking place on the graph. The Markov process provides a dynamical sweeping across all scales in the graph, and the time scale is an intrinsic parameter that uncovers communities at different resolutions. <br />This dynamic-based community detection leads to a compound optimization, which favours communities of comparable centrality (as defined by the stationary distribution), and provides a unifying framework for spectral algorithms, as well as different heuristics for community detection, including versions of modularity and Potts model. Our dynamic framework creates a systematic link between different stochastic dynamics and their corresponding notions of optimal communities under distinct (node and edge) centralities. We show that the Markov Stability can be computed efficiently to find multi-scale community structure in large networks.

010       Spread of Infectious Diseases with a Latent Period
021       Infectious diseases spread through human networks. 
020       Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model is one of the epidemic models to describe infection dynamics on a complex network connecting individuals. In the metapopulation SIR model, each node represents a population (group) which has many individuals. In this paper, we propose a modified metapopulation SIR model in which a latent period is taken into account. We call it SIIR model. We divide the infection period into two stages: an infected stage, which is the same as the previous model, and a seriously ill stage, in which individuals are infected and cannot move to the other populations. The two infectious stages in our modified metapopulation SIR model produce a discontinuous final size distribution. Individuals in the infected stage spread the disease like individuals in the seriously ill stage and never recover directly, which makes an effective recovery rate smaller than the given recovery rate.

010       Extremes Control of Complex Systems With Applications to Social Network
021       The control and risk assessment in complex information systems require to take into account extremes arising from nodes with large node degrees. 
020       Various sampling techniques like a Page Rank random walk, a Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain and others serve to collect information about the nodes. The paper contributes to the comparison of sampling techniques in complex networks by means of the first hitting time, that is the minimal time required to reach a large node. Both the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time is shown to be determined by the so called extremal index. The latter indicates a dependence measure of extremes and also reflects the cluster structure of the network. The clustering is caused by dependence between nodes and heavy-tailed distributions of their degrees. Based on extreme value theory we estimate the mean and the distribution of the first hitting time and the distribution of node degrees by real data from social networks. We demonstrate the heaviness of the tails of these data using appropriate tools. The same methodology can be applied to other complex networks like peer-to-peer telecommunication systems.

010       Node mixing and group structure of complex software networks
021       Large software projects are among most sophisticated human-made systems consisting of a network of interdependent parts. 
020       Past studies of software systems from the perspective of complex networks have already led to notable discoveries with different applications. Nevertheless, our comprehension of the structure of software networks remains to be only partial. We here investigate correlations or mixing between linked nodes and show that software networks reveal dichotomous node degree mixing similar to that recently observed in biological networks. We further show that software networks also reveal characteristic clustering profiles and mixing. Hence, node mixing in software networks significantly differs from that in, e.g., the Internet or social networks. We explain the observed mixing through the presence of groups of nodes with common linking pattern. More precisely, besides densely linked groups known as communities, software networks also consist of disconnected groups denoted modules, core/periphery structures and other. Moreover, groups coincide with the intrinsic properties of the underlying software projects, which promotes practical applications in software engineering.

010       Using multiple-criteria methods to evaluate community partitions
021       Community detection is one of the most studied problems on complex networks. 
020       Although hundreds of methods have been proposed so far, there is still no universally accepted formal definition of what is a good community. As a consequence, the problem of the evaluation and the comparison of the quality of the solutions produced by these algorithms is still an open question, despite constant progress on the topic. In this article, we investigate how using a multi-criteria evaluation can solve some of the existing problems of community evaluation, in particular the question of multiple equally-relevant solutions of different granularity. After exploring several approaches, we introduce a new quality function, called MDensity, and propose a method that can be related both to a widely used community detection metric, the Modularity, and to the Precision/Recall approach, ubiquitous in information retrieval.

010       Network Geometry Inference using Common Neighbors
021       We introduce and explore a new method for inferring hidden geometric coordinates of nodes in complex networks based on the number of common neighbors between the nodes. 
020       We compare this approach to the one in [1], which is based on the connections (and disconnections) between the nodes, i.e., on the links that the nodes have (or do not have). We find that for high degree nodes the common-neighbors approach yields a more accurate inference than the link-based method, unless heuristic periodic adjustments (or "correction steps") are used in the latter. The common-neighbors approach is computationally intensive, requiring $O(t^4)$ running time to map a network of $t$ nodes, versus $O(t^3)$ in the link-based method. But we also develop a hybrid method with $O(t^3)$ running time, which combines the common-neighbors and link-based approaches, and explore a heuristic that reduces its running time further to $O(t^2)$, without significant reduction in the mapping accuracy. We apply this method to the Autonomous Systems (AS) Internet, and reveal how soft communities of ASes evolve over time in the similarity space. We further demonstrate the method's predictive power by forecasting future links between ASes. Taken altogether, our results advance our understanding of how to efficiently and accurately map real networks to their latent geometric spaces, which is an important necessary step towards understanding the laws that govern the dynamics of nodes in these spaces, and the fine-grained dynamics of network connections.

010       Bidirectional selection between two classes in complex social networks
021       The bidirectional selection between two classes widely emerges in various social lives, such as commercial trading and mate choosing. 
020       Until now, the discussions on bidirectional selection in structured human society are quite limited. We demonstrated theoretically that the rate of successfully matching is affected greatly by individuals neighborhoods in social networks, regardless of the type of networks. Furthermore, it is found that the high average degree of networks contributes to increasing rates of successful matches. The matching performance in different types of networks has been quantitatively investigated, revealing that the small-world networks reinforces the matching rate more than scale-free networks at given average degree. In addition, our analysis is consistent with the modeling result, which provides the theoretical understanding of underlying mechanisms of matching in complex networks.

This might be the reason why one frequently finds, in the complex networks literature, assertions regarding their ubiquity, their validity for almost all complex networks. Yet, the mentioned seminal works were conducted on a very limited number of networks, and, to the best of our knowledge, no large-scale study has been conducted to answer this question. In this work, we take advantage, on the one hand, of the many datasets now available online, to constitute a large collection of networks, and on the other hand, of recent analysis tools, to check the validity of this hypothesis of ubiquity. It turns out a large majority of the studied networks are indeed small-world, how-ever this is not the case for the scale-free property, since the degree distribution of a significant proportion of our networks does not follow a power-law.

021       The anatomical structure of the brain can be observed via non-invasive techniques such as diffusion imaging. 
020       However, these are imperfect because they miss connections that are actually known to exist, especially long range inter-hemispheric ones. In this paper we formulate the inverse problem of inferring the structural connectivity of brain networks from experimentally observed functional connectivity via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. We show that structural connectivity can be modeled as an optimal sparse representation derived from the much denser functional connectivity in the human brain. Using only the functional connectivity data as input, we present (a) an optimization problem that models constraints based on known physiological observations, and (b) an ADMM algorithm for solving it. The algorithm not only recovers the known structural connectivity of the brain, but is also able to robustly predict the long range inter-hemispheric connections missed by DSI or DTI, including a very good match with experimentally observed quantitative distributions of the weights/strength of anatomical connections. We demonstrate results on both synthetic model data and a fine-scale 998 node cortical dataset, and discuss applications to other complex network domains where retrieving effective structure from functional signatures are important.

010       Minfer: Inferring Motif Statistics From Sampled Edges
021       Characterizing motif (i.e., locally connected subgraph patterns) statistics is important for understanding complex networks such as online social networks and communication networks. 
020       Previous work made the strong assumption that the graph topology of interest is known, and that the dataset either fits into main memory or stored on disks such that it is not expensive to obtain all neighbors of any given node. In practice, researchers have to deal with the situation where the graph topology is unknown, either because the graph is dynamic, or because it is expensive to collect and store all topological and meta information on disk. Hence, what is available to researchers is only a snapshot of the graph generated by sampling edges from the graph at random, which we called a "RESampled graph". Clearly, a RESampled graph's motif statistics may be quite different from the underlying original graph. To solve this challenge, we propose a framework and implement a system called Minfer, which can take the given RESampled graph and accurately infer the underlying graph's motif statistics. We also use Fisher information to bound the error of our estimates. Experiments using large scale datasets show that our method to be accurate.

010       Support for Eschenmoser&#x27;s Glyoxylate Scenario
021       A core topic of research in prebiotic chemistry is the search for plausible synthetic routes that connect the building blocks of modern life such as sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids to "molecular food sources" that have likely been abundant on Early Earth. 
020       In a recent contribution, Albert Eschenmoser emphasised the importance of catalytic and autocatalytic cycles in establishing such abiotic synthesis pathways. The accumulation of intermediate products furthermore provides additional catalysts that allow pathways to change over time. We show here that generative models of chemical spaces based on graph grammars make it possible to study such phenomena is a systematic manner. In addition to repro- ducing the key steps of Eschenmoser's hypothesis paper, we discovered previously unexplored potentially autocatalytic pathways from HCN to glyoxylate. A cascading of autocatalytic cycles could efficiently re-route matter, distributed over the combinatorial complex network of HCN hydrolysation chemistry, towards a potential primordial metabolism. The generative approach also has it intrinsic limitations: the unsupervised expansion of the chemical space remains infeasible due to the exponential growth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the combinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks forms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the computational exploration by chemical experience is indispensable.

010       Suppressing traffic-driven epidemic spreading by edge-removal strategies
021       The interplay between traffic dynamics and epidemic spreading on complex networks has received increasing attention in recent years. 
020       However, the control of traffic-driven epidemic spreading remains to be a challenging problem. In this Brief Report, we propose a method to suppress traffic-driven epidemic outbreak by properly removing some edges in a network. We find that the epidemic threshold can be enhanced by the targeted cutting of links among large-degree nodes or edges with the largest algorithmic betweeness. In contrast, the epidemic threshold will be reduced by the random edge removal. These findings are robust with respect to traffic-flow conditions, network structures and routing strategies. Moreover, we find that the shutdown of targeted edges can effectively release traffic load passing through large-degree nodes, rendering a relatively low probability of infection to these nodes.

010       Driven synchronization in random networks of oscillators
021       Synchronization is a universal phenomenon found in many non-equilibrium systems. 
020       Much recent interest in this area has overlapped with the study of complex networks, where a major focus is determining how a system's connectivity patterns affect the types of behavior that it can produce. Thus far, modeling efforts have focused on the tendency of networks of oscillators to mutually synchronize themselves, with less emphasis on the effects of external driving. In this work we discuss the interplay between mutual and driven synchronization in networks of phase oscillators of the Kuramoto type, and resolve how the structure and emergence of such states depends on the underlying network topology for simple random networks with a given degree distribution. We provide a partial bifurcation analysis, centering on the appearance of a Takens-Bogdanov-Cusp singularity, which broadly separates homogeneous and heterogeneous network behavior in a weak coupling limit, and from which the number, stability and appearance of driven and mutually synchronized states can be determined, as a function of a few parameters. We find transitions such as Saddle-Node-Infinite-Periods, Limit-Point-of-Cycles, and Hopf bifurcations (both branches), as well as multiple bistability regions and dynamics that differ for the network types. This description is connected to the underlying dynamics of oscillator clusters for important states and transitions. Our results can provide a basis for studying the problem of frequency controlling disordered oscillator networks.

010       Abnormal Synchronizing Path of Delay-coupled Chaotic Oscillators on the   Edge of Stability
021       In this paper, the transition of synchronizing path of delay-coupled chaotic oscillators in a scale-free network is highlighted. 
020       Mainly, through the critical transmission delay makes chaotic oscillators be coupled on the edge of stability, we find that the transition of synchronizing path is \emph{abnormal}, which is characterized by the following evidences: (a) synchronization process starts with low-degree rather than high-degree ones; (b) the high-degree nodes don't undertake the role of hub; (c) the synchronized subnetworks show a poor small-world property as a result of hubs absence; (d) the clustering synchronization behavior emerges even community structure is absent in the scale-free network. This abnormal synchronizing path suggests that the diverse synchronization behaviors occur in the same topology, which implies that the relationship between dynamics and structure of network is much more complicated than the common sense that the structure is the foundation of dynamics. Moreover, it also reveals the potential connection from the transition of synchronization behavior to disorder in real complex networks, e.g. Alzheimer disease.

010       How Damage Diversification Can Reduce Systemic Risk
021       We consider the problem of risk diversification in complex networks. 
020       Nodes represent e.g. financial actors, whereas weighted links represent e.g. financial obligations (credits/debts). Each node has a risk to fail because of losses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure cascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network effects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses (i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification, ED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher connectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure risk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage diversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on neighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we quantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For this, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to weighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This allows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their directed weights differ strongly. On the macro level, we provide an analytical expression for the average cascade size, to quantify systemic risk. Furthermore, on the meso level we calculate failure probabilities of nodes conditional on their system relevance.

010       Synchronization centrality and explosive synchronization in complex   networks
021       Synchronization of networked oscillators is known to depend fundamentally on the interplay between the dynamics of the graph's units and the microscopic arrangement of the network's structure. 
020       For non identical elements, the lack of quantitative tools has hampered so far a systematic study of the mechanisms behind such a collective behavior. We here propose an effective network whose topological properties reflect the interplay between the topology and dynamics of the original network. On that basis, we are able to introduce the "synchronization centrality", a measure which quantifies the role and importance of each network's node in the synchronization process. In particular, we use such a measure to assess the propensity of a graph to synchronize explosively, thus indicating a unified framework for most of the different models proposed so far for such an irreversible transition. Taking advantage of the predicting power of this measure, we furthermore discuss a strategy to induce the explosive behavior in a generic network, by acting only upon a small fraction of its nodes.

010       Spectrum of Controlling and Observing Complex Networks
021       Observing and controlling complex networks are of paramount interest for understanding complex physical, biological and technological systems. 
020       Recent studies have made important advances in identifying sensor or driver nodes, through which we can observe or control a complex system. Yet, the observation uncertainty induced by measurement noise and the energy cost required for control continue to be significant challenges in practical applications. Here we show that the control energy cost and the observation uncertainty vary widely in different directions of the state space. In particular, we find that if all nodes are directly driven, control is energetically feasible, as the maximum energy cost increases sublinearly with the system size. If, however, we aim to control a system by driving only a single node, control in some directions is energetically prohibitive, increasing exponentially with the system size. For the cases in between, the maximum energy decays exponentially if we increase the number of driver nodes. We validate our findings in both model systems and real networks. Our results provide fundamental laws that deepen our understanding of diverse complex systems.

010       Faster unfolding of communities: speeding up the Louvain algorithm
021       Many complex networks exhibit a modular structure of densely connected groups of nodes. 
020       Usually, such a modular structure is uncovered by the optimisation of some quality function. Although flawed, Modularity remains one of the most popular quality functions. The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for optimising Modularity, but has been applied to a variety of methods. As such, speeding up the Louvain algorithm, enables the analysis of larger graphs in a shorter time for various methods. We here suggest to consider moving nodes to the community of a random neighbour, instead of the best neighbouring community. Although incredibly simple, it reduces the theoretical runtime complexity from $O(m)$ to $O(n \log &lt;k&gt;)$ in networks with a clear community structure. In benchmark networks, resembling real networks more closely, it speeds up the algorithm roughly 2-3 times. This is due to two factors: (1) a random neighbour is likely to be in a "good" community; and (2) random neighbours are likely to be hubs, helping the convergence. Finally, the performance gain only slightly diminishes the quality, thus providing an excellent quality-performance ratio. However, these gains do not seem to hold up when detecting small communities in large graphs.

010       Directed transport in quantum star graphs
021       We study the quantum dynamics of Gaussian wave packets on star graphs whose arms feature each a periodic potential and an external time-dependent field. 
020       Assuming that the potentials and the field can be manipulated separately for each arm of the star, we show that it is possible to manipulate the direction of the motion of a Gaussian wave packet through the bifurcation point by a suitable choice of the parameters of the external fields. In doing so, one can achieve a transmission of the wave packet into the desired arm with nearly 70\% while also keeping the shape of the wave packet approximately intact. Since a star graph is the simplest element of many other complex graphs, the obtained results can be considered as the first step to wave packet manipulations on complex networks.

010       Hyperbolicity Measures &quot;Democracy&quot; in Real-World Networks
021       We analyze the hyperbolicity of real-world networks, a geometric quantity that measures if a space is negatively curved. 
020       In our interpretation, a network with small hyperbolicity is "aristocratic", because it contains a small set of vertices involved in many shortest paths, so that few elements "connect" the systems, while a network with large hyperbolicity has a more "democratic" structure with a larger number of crucial elements. <br />We prove mathematically the soundness of this interpretation, and we derive its consequences by analyzing a large dataset of real-world networks. We confirm and improve previous results on hyperbolicity, and we analyze them in the light of our interpretation. <br />Moreover, we study (for the first time in our knowledge) the hyperbolicity of the neighborhood of a given vertex. This allows to define an "influence area" for the vertices in the graph. We show that the influence area of the highest degree vertex is small in what we define "local" networks, like most social or peer-to-peer networks. On the other hand, if the network is built in order to reach a "global" goal, as in metabolic networks or autonomous system networks, the influence area is much larger, and it can contain up to half the vertices in the graph. In conclusion, our newly introduced approach allows to distinguish the topology and the structure of various complex networks.

010       Division of labor, skill complementarity, and heterophily in   socioeconomic networks
021       Constituents of complex systems interact with each other and self-organize to form complex networks. 
020       Empirical results show that the link formation process of many real networks follows either the global principle of popularity or the local principle of similarity or a tradeoff between the two. In particular, it has been shown that in social networks individuals exhibit significant homophily when choosing their collaborators. We demonstrate, however, that in populations in which there is a division of labor, skill complementarity is an important factor in the formation of socioeconomic networks and an individual's choice of collaborators is strongly affected by heterophily. We analyze 124 evolving virtual worlds of a popular "massively multiplayer online role-playing game" (MMORPG) in which people belong to three different professions and are allowed to work and interact with each other in a somewhat realistic manner. We find evidence of heterophily in the formation of collaboration networks, where people prefer to forge social ties with people who have professions different from their own. We then construct an economic model to quantify the heterophily by assuming that individuals in socioeconomic systems choose collaborators that are of maximum utility. The results of model calibration confirm the presence of heterophily. Both empirical analysis and model calibration show that the heterophilous feature is persistent along the evolution of virtual worlds. We also find that the degree of complementarity in virtual societies is positively correlated with their economic output. Our work sheds new light on the scientific research utility of virtual worlds for studying human behaviors in complex socioeconomic systems.

010       Unwinding the hairball graph: pruning algorithms for weighted complex   networks
021       Empirical networks of weighted dyadic relations often contain noisy edges that alter the global characteristics of the network and obfuscate the most important structures therein. 
020       Graph pruning is the process of identifying the most significant edges according to a generative null model, and extracting the subgraph consisting of those edges. Here we introduce a simple and intuitive null model based on the configuration model of network generation, and derive two significance filters from it: the Marginal Likelihood Filter (MLF) and the Global Likelihood Filter (GLF). The former is a fast algorithm assigning a significance score to each edge based on the marginal distribution of edge weights whereas the latter is an ensemble approach which takes into account the correlations among edges. We apply these filters to the network of air traffic volume between US airports and recover a geographically faithful representation of the graph. Furthermore, compared with thresholding based on edge weight, we show that our filters extract a larger and significantly sparser giant component.

010       Controlled Label Propagation: Preventing Over-Propagation through   Gradual Expansion
021       Identifying communities has always been a fundamental task in analysis of complex networks. 
020       Many methods have been devised over the last decade for detection of communities. Amongst them, the label propagation algorithm brings great scalability together with high accuracy. However, it has one major flaw; when the community structure in the network is not clear enough, it will assign every node the same label, thus detecting the whole graph as one giant community. We have addressed this issue by setting a capacity for communities, starting from a small value and gradually increasing it over time. Preliminary results show that not only our extension improves the detection capability of classic label propagation algorithm when communities are not clearly detectable, but also improves the overall quality of the identified clusters in complex networks with a clear community structure.

010       Complex Quantum Network Geometries: Evolution and Phase Transitions
021       Networks are topological and geometric structures used to describe systems as different as the Internet, the brain or the quantum structure of space-time. 
020       Here we define complex quantum network geometries, describing the underlying structure of growing simplicial 2-complexes, i.e. simplicial complexes formed by triangles. These networks are geometric networks with energies of the links that grow according to a non-equilibrium dynamics. The evolution in time of the geometric networks is a classical evolution describing a given path of a path integral defining the quantum evolution of quantum network states. The quantum network states are characterized by quantum occupation numbers that can be mapped respectively to the nodes, links, and triangles incident to each link of the network. We call the geometric networks describing the evolution of quantum network states the quantum geometric networks.The quantum geometric networks have many properties common to complex networks including small-world property, high clustering coefficient, high modularity, scale-free degree distribution.Moreover the quantum geometric networks can be distinguished between the Fermi-Dirac Network and the Bose-Einstein Network obeying respectively the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics. We show that these networks can undergo structural phase transitions where the geometrical properties of the networks change drastically.Finally we comment on the relation between the Fermi-Dirac Network and spin networks.

010       A Climate Network Based Stability Index for El Ni\~no Variability
021       Most of the existing prediction methods gave a false alarm regarding the El Ni\~no event in 2014. 
020       A crucial aspect is currently limiting the success of such predictions, i.e. the stability of the slowly varying Pacific climate. This property determines whether sea surface temperature perturbations will be amplified by coupled ocean-atmosphere feedbacks or not. The so-called Bjerknes stability index has been developed for this purpose, but its evaluation is severely constrained by data availability. Here we present a new promising background stability index based on complex network theory. This index efficiently monitors the changes in spatial correlations in the Pacific climate and can be evaluated by using only sea surface temperature data.

020       Here, we study opinion formation and imitation on an adaptive complex network which is dependent on the individual dynamic state of each node and vice versa to model the co-evolution of renewable resources with the dynamics of harvesting agents on a social network. The adaptive voter model is coupled to a set of identical logistic growth models and we show that in such systems, the rate of interactions between nodes as well as the adaptive rewiring probability play a crucial role for the sustainability of the system's equilibrium state. We derive a macroscopic description of the system which provides a general framework to model and quantify the influence of single node dynamics on the macroscopic state of the network and is applicable to many fields of study, such as epidemic spreading or social modeling.

010       Complex Networks, Communities and Clustering: A survey
021       This paper is an extensive survey of literature on complex network communities and clustering. 
020       Complex networks describe a widespread variety of systems in nature and society especially systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical entities. Complex networks like real networks can also have community structure. There are several types of methods and algorithms for detection and identification of communities in complex networks. Several complex networks have the property of clustering or network transitivity. Some of the important concepts in the field of complex networks are small-world and scale-robustness, degree distributions, clustering, network correlations, random graph models, models of network growth, dynamical processes on networks, etc. Some current areas of research on complex network communities are those on community evolution, overlapping communities, communities in directed networks, community characterization and interpretation, etc. Many of the algorithms or methods proposed for network community detection through clustering are modified versions of or inspired from the concepts of minimum-cut based algorithms, hierarchical connectivity based algorithms, the original GirvanNewman algorithm, concepts of modularity maximization, algorithms utilizing metrics from information and coding theory, and clique based algorithms.

010       Measuring Systemic Risk: Robust Ranking Techniques Approach
021       The recent economic crisis has raised a wide awareness that the financial system should be considered as a complex network with financial institutions and financial dependencies respectively as nodes and links between these nodes. 
020       Systemic risk is defined as the risk of default of a large portion of financial exposures among institution in the network. Indeed, the structure of this network is an important element to measure systemic risk and there is no widely accepted methodology to determine the systemically important nodes in a large financial network. In this research, we introduce a metric for systemic risk measurement with taking into account both common idiosyncratic shocks as well as contagion through counterparty exposures. Our focus is on application of eigenvalue problems, as a robust approach to the ranking techniques, to measure systemic risk. Recently, the efficient algorithm has been developed for robust eigenvector problem to reduce to a nonsmooth convex optimization problem. We applied this technique and studied the performance and convergence behavior of the algorithm with different structure of the financial network.

010       On the k-Anonymization of Time-varying and Multi-layer Social Graphs
021       The popularity of online social media platforms provides an unprecedented opportunity to study real-world complex networks of interactions. 
020       However, releasing this data to researchers and the public comes at the cost of potentially exposing private and sensitive user information. It has been shown that a naive anonymization of a network by removing the identity of the nodes is not sufficient to preserve users' privacy. In order to deal with malicious attacks, k-anonymity solutions have been proposed to partially obfuscate topological information that can be used to infer nodes' identity. <br />In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring k-anonymity in time-varying graphs, i.e., graphs with a structure that changes over time, and multi-layer graphs, i.e., graphs with multiple types of links. More specifically, we examine the case in which the attacker has access to the degree of the nodes. The goal is to generate a new graph where, given the degree of a node in each (temporal) layer of the graph, such a node remains indistinguishable from other k-1 nodes in the graph. In order to achieve this, we find the optimal partitioning of the graph nodes such that the cost of anonymizing the degree information within each group is minimum. We show that this reduces to a special case of a Generalized Assignment Problem, and we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to solve it. Finally, we introduce an iterated linear programming approach to enforce the realizability of the anonymized degree sequences. The efficacy of the method is assessed through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs.

010       SIRS Epidemics on Complex Networks: Concurrence of Exact Markov Chain   and Approximated Models
021       We study the SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) spreading processes over complex networks, by considering its exact $3^n$-state Markov chain model. 
020       The Markov chain model exhibits an interesting connection with its $2n$-state nonlinear "mean-field" approximation and the latter's corresponding linear approximation. We show that under the specific threshold where the disease-free state is a globally stable fixed point of both the linear and nonlinear models, the exact underlying Markov chain has an $O(\log n)$ mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly. In fact, the epidemic eradication condition coincides for all the three models. Furthermore, when the threshold condition is violated, which indicates that the linear model is not stable, we show that there exists a unique second fixed point for the nonlinear model, which corresponds to the endemic state. We also investigate the effect of adding immunization to the SIRS epidemics by introducing two different models, depending on the efficacy of the vaccine. Our results indicate that immunization improves the threshold of epidemic eradication. Furthermore, the common threshold for fast-mixing of the Markov chain and global stability of the disease-free fixed point improves by the same factor for the vaccination-dominant model.

010       Measuring robustness of community structure in complex networks
021       The theory of community structure is a powerful tool for real networks, which can simplify their topological and functional analysis considerably. 
020       However, since community detection methods have random factors and real social networks obtained from complex systems always contain error edges, evaluating the robustness of community structure is an urgent and important task. In this letter, we employ the critical threshold of resolution parameter in Hamiltonian function, $\gamma_C$, to measure the robustness of a network. According to spectral theory, a rigorous proof shows that the index we proposed is inversely proportional to robustness of community structure. Furthermore, by utilizing the co-evolution model, we provides a new efficient method for computing the value of $\gamma_C$. The research can be applied to broad clustering problems in network analysis and data mining due to its solid mathematical basis and experimental effects.

010       Potts model based on a Markov process computation solves the community   structure problem effectively
021       Potts model is a powerful tool to uncover community structure in complex networks. 
020       Here, we propose a new framework to reveal the optimal number of communities and stability of network structure by quantitatively analyzing the dynamics of Potts model. Specifically we model the community structure detection Potts procedure by a Markov process, which has a clear mathematical explanation. Then we show that the local uniform behavior of spin values across multiple timescales in the representation of the Markov variables could naturally reveal the network's hierarchical community structure. In addition, critical topological information regarding to multivariate spin configuration could also be inferred from the spectral signatures of the Markov process. Finally an algorithm is developed to determine fuzzy communities based on the optimal number of communities and the stability across multiple timescales. The effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm are theoretically analyzed as well as experimentally validated.

010       Preferential imitation of vaccinating behavior can invalidate the   targeted subsidy on complex network
021       We consider the effect of inducement to vaccinate during the spread of an infectious disease on complex networks. 
020       Suppose that public resources are finite and that only a small proportion of individuals can be vaccinated freely (complete subsidy), for the remainder of the population vaccination is a voluntary behavior --- and each vaccinated individual carries a perceived cost. We ask whether the classical targeted subsidy strategy is definitely better than the random strategy: does targeting subsidy at individuals perceived to be with the greatest risk actually help? With these questions, we propose a model to investigate the \emph{interaction effects} of the subsidy policies and individuals responses when facing subsidy policies on the epidemic dynamics on complex networks. In the model, a small proportion of individuals are freely vaccinated according to either the targeted or random subsidy policy, the remainder choose to vaccinate (or not) based on voluntary principle and update their vaccination decision via an imitation rule. Our findings show that the targeted strategy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals' strategy. Otherwise, the effect of the targeted policy is worse than the random immunization, since individuals preferentially select non-subsidized individuals as the imitation objects. More importantly, we find that under the targeted subsidy policy, increasing the proportion of subsidized individuals may increase the final epidemic size. We further define social cost as the sum of the costs of vaccination and infection, and study how each of the two policies affect the social cost. Our result shows that there exist some optimal intermediate regions leading to the minimal social cost.

010       Evolutionary Poisson Games for Controlling Large Population Behaviors
021       Emerging applications in engineering such as crowd-sourcing and (mis)information propagation involve a large population of heterogeneous users or agents in a complex network who strategically make dynamic decisions. 
020       In this work, we establish an evolutionary Poisson game framework to capture the random, dynamic and heterogeneous interactions of agents in a holistic fashion, and design mechanisms to control their behaviors to achieve a system-wide objective. We use the antivirus protection challenge in cyber security to motivate the framework, where each user in the network can choose whether or not to adopt the software. We introduce the notion of evolutionary Poisson stable equilibrium for the game, and show its existence and uniqueness. Online algorithms are developed using the techniques of stochastic approximation coupled with the population dynamics, and they are shown to converge to the optimal solution of the controller problem. Numerical examples are used to illustrate and corroborate our results.

010       Network Analysis of Cosmic Structures : Network Centrality and   Topological Environment
021       We apply simple analyses techniques developed for the study of complex networks to the study of the cosmic web, the large scale galaxy distribution. 
020       In this paper, we measure three network centralities (ranks of topological importance), Degree Centrality (DC), Closeness Centrality (CL), and Betweenness Centrality (BC) from a network built from the Cosmological Evolution Survey (COSMOS) catalog. We define 8 galaxy populations according to the centrality measures; Void, Wall, and Cluster by DC, Main Branch and Dangling Leaf by BC, and Kernel, Backbone, and Fracture by CL. We also define three populations by voronoi tessellation density to compare these with the DC selection. We apply the topological selections to galaxies in the (photometric) redshift range $0.91&lt;z&lt;0.94$ from the COSMOS survey, and explore whether the red and blue galaxy populations show differences in color, star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass in the different topological regions. Despite the limitations and uncertainties associated with using photometric redshift and indirect measurements of galactic parameters, the preliminary results illustrate the potential of network analysis. The coming future surveys will provide better statistical samples to test and improve this "network cosmology".

010       Time Centrality in Dynamic Complex Networks
021       There is an ever-increasing interest in investigating dynamics in time-varying graphs (TVGs). 
020       Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in TVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of nodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG scenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a given node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for taking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the notion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time centrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic complex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics related to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using a real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network. We validate the concept of time centrality showing that diffusion starting at the best classified time instants (i.e. the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster and more efficient diffusion process.

010       Overlapping Community Structure in Co-authorship Networks: a Case Study
021       Community structure is one of the key properties of real-world complex networks. 
020       It plays a crucial role in their behaviors and topology. While an important work has been done on the issue of community detection, very little attention has been devoted to the analysis of the community structure. In this paper, we present an extensive investigation of the overlapping community network deduced from a large-scale co-authorship network. The nodes of the overlapping community network represent the functional communities of the co-authorship network, and the links account for the fact that communities share some nodes in the co-authorship network. The comparative evaluation of the topological properties of these two networks shows that they share similar topological properties. These results are very interesting. Indeed, the network of communities seems to be a good representative of the original co-authorship network. With its smaller size, it may be more practical in order to realize various analyses that cannot be performed easily in large-scale real-world networks.

010       Nonnegative Multi-level Network Factorization for Latent Factor Analysis
021       Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) aims to factorize a matrix into two optimized nonnegative matrices and has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks such as product recommendation based on a rating matrix. 
020       However, although networks between nodes with the same nature exist, standard NMF overlooks them, e.g., the social network between users. This problem leads to comparatively low recommendation accuracy because these networks are also reflections of the nature of the nodes, such as the preferences of users in a social network. Also, social networks, as complex networks, have many different structures. Each structure is a composition of links between nodes and reflects the nature of nodes, so retaining the different network structures will lead to differences in recommendation performance. To investigate the impact of these network structures on the factorization, this paper proposes four multi-level network factorization algorithms based on the standard NMF, which integrates the vertical network (e.g., rating matrix) with the structures of horizontal network (e.g., user social network). These algorithms are carefully designed with corresponding convergence proofs to retain four desired network structures. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed algorithms are able to preserve the desired network structures as designed. Experiments on real-world data show that considering the horizontal networks improves the accuracy of document clustering and recommendation with standard NMF, and various structures show their differences in performance on these two tasks. These results can be directly used in document clustering and recommendation systems.

010       Identification of highly susceptible individuals in complex networks
021       Identifying highly susceptible individuals in spreading processes is of great significance in controlling outbreaks. 
020       In this paper, we explore the susceptibility of people in susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and rumor spreading dynamics. We first study the impact of community structure on people's susceptibility. Despite that the community structure can reduce the infected population given same infection rates, it will not deterministically affect nodes' susceptibility. We find the susceptibility of individuals is sensitive to the choice of spreading dynamics. For SIR spreading, since the susceptibility is highly correlated to nodes' influence, the topological indicator k-shell can better identify highly susceptible individuals, outperforming degree, betweenness centrality and PageRank. In contrast, in rumor spreading model, where nodes' susceptibility and influence have no clear correlation, degree performs the best among considered topological measures. Our finding highlights the significance of both topological features and spreading mechanisms in identifying highly susceptible population.

010       A parameter free similarity index based on clustering ability for link   prediction in complex networks
021       Link prediction in complex network based on solely topological information is a challenging problem. 
020       In this paper, we propose a novel similarity index, which is efficient and parameter free, based on clustering ability. Here clustering ability is defined as average clustering coefficient of nodes with the same degree. The motivation of our idea is that common-neighbors are able to contribute to the likelihood of forming a link because they own some ability of clustering their neighbors together, and then clustering ability defined here is a measure for this capacity. Experimental numerical simulations on both real-world networks and modeled networks demonstrated the high accuracy and high efficiency of the new similarity index compared with three well-known common-neighbor based similarity indices: CN, AA and RA.

010       Temporal Gillespie algorithm: Fast simulation of contagion processes on   time-varying networks
021       Stochastic simulations are one of the cornerstones of the analysis of dynamical processes on complex networks, and are often the only accessible way to explore their behavior. 
020       The development of fast algorithms is paramount to allow large-scale simulations. The Gillespie algorithm can be used for fast simulation of stochastic processes, and variants of it have been applied to simulate dynamical processes on static networks. However, its adaptation to temporal networks remains non-trivial. We here present a temporal Gillespie algorithm that solves this problem. Our method is applicable to general Poisson (constant-rate) processes on temporal networks, stochastically exact, and up to orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulation schemes based on rejection sampling. We also show how it can be extended to simulate non-Markovian processes. The algorithm is easily applicable in practice, and as an illustration we detail how to simulate both Poissonian and non-Markovian models of epidemic spreading. Namely, we provide pseudocode and its implementation in C++ for simulating the paradigmatic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with non-constant recovery rates.

010       Phase transitions for scaling of structural correlations in directed   networks
021       Analysis of degree-degree dependencies in complex networks, and their impact on processes on networks requires null models, i.e. 
020       models that generate uncorrelated scale-free networks. Most models to date however show structural negative dependencies, caused by finite size effects. We analyze the behavior of these structural negative degree-degree dependencies, using rank based correlation measures, in the directed Erased Configuration Model. We obtain expressions for the scaling as a function of the exponents of the distributions. Moreover, we show that this scaling undergoes a phase transition, where one region exhibits scaling related to the natural cut-off of the network while another region has scaling similar to the structural cut-off for uncorrelated networks. By establishing the speed of convergence of these structural dependencies we are able to asses statistical significance of degree-degree dependencies on finite complex networks when compared to networks generated by the directed Erased Configuration Model.

010       A complex network approach to cloud computing
021       Cloud computing has become an important means to speed up computing. 
020       One problem influencing heavily the performance of such systems is the choice of nodes as servers responsible for executing the users' tasks. In this article we report how complex networks can be used to model such a problem. More specifically, we investigate the performance of the processing respectively to cloud systems underlain by Erdos-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert topology containing two servers. Cloud networks involving two communities not necessarily of the same size are also considered in our analysis. The performance of each configuration is quantified in terms of two indices: the cost of communication between the user and the nearest server, and the balance of the distribution of tasks between the two servers. Regarding the latter index, the ER topology provides better performance than the BA case for smaller average degrees and opposite behavior for larger average degrees. With respect to the cost, smaller values are found in the BA topology irrespective of the average degree. In addition, we also verified that it is easier to find good servers in the ER than in BA. Surprisingly, balance and cost are not too much affected by the presence of communities. However, for a well-defined community network, we found that it is important to assign each server to a different community so as to achieve better performance.

010       On the stability of the PWP method
021       The PWP method was introduced by Diaz in 2009 as a technique for measuring indirect influences in complex networks. 
020       It depends on a matrix D, provided by the user, called the matrix of direct influences, and on a positive real parameter which is part of the method itself. We study changes in the method's predictions as D and the parameter vary.

010       Control of two-photon quantum walk in a complex multimode system by   wavefront shaping
021       Multi-photon interferences in complex multimode structures - quantum walks - are of both funda- mental and technological interest. 
020       They rely on the ability to design the complex network where the walk occurs. Here, we demonstrate the control of quantum walks of two indistinguishable photons in a complex linear system - a highly multimode fiber - by means of wavefront shaping techniques. Using the measured transmission matrix of the fiber, we demonstrate the ability to address arbitrary output modes of the two-photon speckle pattern, and simultaneous control of the quantum inter- ferences. This work provides a reconfigurable platform for multi-photon, multimode interference experiments and a route to high-dimensional quantum systems.

010       Synergy, redundancy and unnormalized Granger causality
021       We analyze by means of Granger causality the effect of synergy and redundancy in the inference (from time series data) of the information flow between subsystems of a complex network. 
020       Whilst fully conditioned Granger causality is not affected by synergy, the pairwise analysis fails to put in evidence synergetic effects. We show that maximization of the total Granger causality to a given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables, puts in evidence redundant multiplets of variables influencing the target, provided that an {\it unnormalized} definition of Granger causality is adopted. Along the same lines we also introduce a pairwise index of synergy (w.r.t. to information flow to a third variable) which is zero when two independent sources additively influence a common target, differently from previous definitions of synergy.

010       Stability threshold approach for complex networks
021       A new measure to characterize stability of dynamical networks against large perturbation is suggested, the stability threshold (ST). 
020       It quantifies the magnitude of the weakest perturbation capable to disrupt a network and switch it to an undesired dynamical regime. We introduce a computational algorithm for calculating the stability threshold for arbitrary dynamical systems. We demonstrate that this approach is effective and provides important insights.

010       Opinion percolation in structured population
021       In a recent work [Shao $et$ $al$ 2009 Phys. 
020       Rev. Lett. \textbf{108} 018701], a nonconsensus opinion (NCO) model was proposed, where two opinions can stably coexist by forming clusters of agents holding the same opinion. The NCO model on lattices and several complex networks displays a phase transition behavior, which is characterized by a large spanning cluster of nodes holding the same opinion appears when the initial fraction of nodes holding this opinion is above a certain critical value. In the NCO model, each agent will convert to its opposite opinion if there are more than half of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood. In this paper, we generalize the NCO model by assuming that each agent will change its opinion if the fraction of agents holding the opposite opinion in its neighborhood exceeds a threshold $T$ ($T\geq 0.5$). We call this generalized model as the NCOT model. We apply the NCOT model on different network structures and study the formation of opinion clusters. We find that the NCOT model on lattices displays a continuous phase transition. For random graphs and scale-free networks, the NCOT model shows a discontinuous phase transition when the threshold is small and the average degree of the network is large, while in other cases the NCOT model displays a continuous phase transition.

010       Impact of density-dependent migration flows on epidemic outbreaks in   heterogeneous metapopulations
021       We investigate the role of migration patterns on the spread of epidemics in complex networks. 
020       We enhance the SIS-diffusion model on metapopulations to a nonlinear diffusion. Specifically, individuals move randomly over the network but at a rate depending on the population of the departure patch. In the absence of epidemics, the migration-driven equilibrium is described by quantifying the total number of individuals living in heavily/lightly populated areas. Our analytical approach reveals that strengthening the migration from populous areas contains the infection at the early stage of the epidemic. Moreover, depending on the exponent of the nonlinear diffusion rate, epidemic outbreaks do not always occur in the most populated areas as one might expect.

010       Improving detection of influential nodes in complex networks
021       Recently an increasing amount of research is devoted to the question of how the most influential nodes (seeds) can be found effectively in a complex network. 
020       There are a number of measures proposed for this purpose, for instance, high-degree centrality measure reflects the importance of the network topology and has a reasonable runtime performance to find a set of nodes with highest degree, but they do not have a satisfactory dissemination potentiality in the network due to having many common neighbors ($\mbox{CN}^{(1)}$) and common neighbors of neighbors ($\mbox{CN}^{(2)}$). This flaw holds in other measures as well. In this paper, we compare high-degree centrality measure with other well-known measures using ten datasets in order to find a proportion for the common seeds in the seed sets obtained by them. We, thereof, propose an improved high-degree centrality measure (named DegreeDistance) and improve it to enhance accuracy in two phases, FIDD and SIDD, by putting a threshold on the number of common neighbors of already-selected seed nodes and a non-seed node which is under investigation to be selected as a seed as well as considering the influence score of seed nodes directly or through their common neighbors over the non-seed node. To evaluate the accuracy and runtime performance of DegreeDistance, FIDD, and SIDD, they are applied to eight large-scale networks and it finally turns out that SIDD dramatically outperforms other well-known measures and evinces comparatively more accurate performance in identifying the most influential nodes.

010       Signal-Flow Based Runge-Kutta Methods for the Simulation of Complex   Networks
021       Complex dynamical networks appear in a wide range of physical, biological, and engineering systems. 
020       The coupling of subsystems with varying time scales often results in multirate behavior. During the simulation of highly integrated circuits, for example, only a few elements underlie changing signals whereas the major part -- usually up to 80 or even 90 per cent -- remains latent. Standard integration schemes discretize the entire circuit with a single step size which is mainly limited by the accuracy requirements of the rapidly changing subcircuits. It is of a particular interest to speed up the simulation without a significant loss of accuracy. By exploiting the latency of the system, only a fraction of the equations has to be formulated and solved at a given time point. <br />G\"unther and Rentrop suggest that multirate strategies must be based both on the numerical information of the integration scheme and on the topology of the circuit. In this paper, we will introduce a directed graph describing the interdependency of the underlying system and propose Runge--Kutta methods which utilize the signal flow of the system in order to identify and exploit inactive regions. Furthermore, we describe an extension of these methods to identify and exploit periodic subsystems.

010       Locating influential nodes via dynamics-sensitive centrality
021       With great theoretical and practical significance, locating influential nodes of complex networks is a promising issues. 
020       In this paper, we propose a dynamics-sensitive (DS) centrality that integrates topological features and dynamical properties. The DS centrality can be directly applied in locating influential spreaders. According to the empirical results on four real networks for both susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and susceptible-infected (SI) spreading models, the DS centrality is much more accurate than degree, $k$-shell index and eigenvector centrality.

010       Common neighbours and the local-community-paradigm for topological link   prediction in bipartite networks
021       Bipartite networks are powerful descriptions of complex systems characterized by two different classes of nodes and connections allowed only across the two classes. 
020       For instance, modelling the connections between workers and their employers, or electors and parties they vote for, are examples of affiliation networks in social analysis. Ultimately, predicting interactions between products and consumers in personal recommendation systems and market models can provide priceless information for managing cyber-commerce. Surprisingly, current complex network theory presents a theoretical bottle-neck: a general framework for local-based link prediction directly in the bipartite domain is missing. Indeed, local state-of-the-art methods for link prediction do not directly exploit the inner bipartite topology, but rather rely on its projection into two one-mode-dimension networks, an example of which is the monopartite network of consumers connected by products and the monopartite network of products connected by consumers. Unfortunately, the one-mode-projections are always less informative than the original bipartite structure. Here, we overcome this theoretical obstacle, and we present a formal definition of common neighbour index (CN) and local-community-paradigm (LCP) for bipartite networks. As a consequence, we are able to introduce the first node-neighbourhood-based and LCP-based models for topological link prediction that utilizes the bipartite domain. We performed link prediction evaluations in several networks of different size and of disparate origin, including technological, social and biological systems. Our models significantly improve topological prediction in many bipartite networks, and represent the first attempt to create a local-based formalism that allows to intuitively implement link prediction fully in the bipartite domain.

010       Modeling Memetics using Edge Diversity
021       The study of meme propagation and the prediction of meme trajectory are emerging areas of interest in the field of complex networks research. 
020       In addition to the properties of the meme itself, the structural properties of the underlying network decides the speed and the trajectory of the propagating meme. In this paper, we provide an artificial framework for studying the meme propagation patterns. Firstly, the framework includes a synthetic network which simulates a real world network and acts as a testbed for meme simulation. Secondly, we propose a meme spreading model based on the diversity of edges in the network. Through the experiments conducted, we show that the generated synthetic network combined with the proposed spreading model is able to simulate a real world meme spread. Our proposed model is validated by the propagation of the Higgs boson meme on Twitter as well as many real world social networks.

010       Modelling Microtubules in the Brain as n-qudit Quantum Hopfield Network   and Beyond
021       The scientific approach to understand the nature of consciousness revolves around the study of human brain. 
020       Neurobiological studies that compare the nervous system of different species have accorded highest place to the humans on account of various factors that include a highly developed cortical area comprising of approximately 100 billion neurons, that are intrinsically connected to form a highly complex network. Quantum theories of consciousness are based on mathematical abstraction and Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory is one of the most promising ones. Inspired by Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR Theory, Behrman et. al. (Behrman, 2006) have simulated a quantum Hopfield neural network with the structure of a microtubule. They have used an extremely simplified model of the tubulin dimers with each dimer represented simply as a qubit, a single quantum two-state system. The extension of this model to n-dimensional quantum states, or n-qudits presented in this work holds considerable promise for even higher mathematical abstraction in modelling consciousness systems.

021       Investigation of divisibility properties of natural numbers is one of the most important themes in the theory of numbers. 
020       Various tools have been developed over the centuries to discover and study the various patterns in the sequence of natural numbers in the context of divisibility. In the present paper, we study the divisibility of natural numbers using the framework of a growing complex network. In particular, using tools from the field of statistical inference, we show that the network is scale-free but has a non-stationary degree distribution. Along with this, we report a new kind of similarity pattern for the local clustering, which we call "stretching similarity", in this network. We also show that the various characteristics like average degree, global clustering coefficient and assortativity coefficient of the network vary smoothly with the size of the network. Using analytical arguments we estimate the asymptotic behavior of global clustering and average degree which is validated using numerical analysis.

010       Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks based on gravity   formula
021       How to identify the influential spreaders in social networks is crucial for accelerating/hindering information diffusion, increasing product exposure, controlling diseases and rumors, and so on. 
020       In this paper, by viewing the k-shell value of each node as its mass and the shortest path distance between two nodes as their distance, then inspired by the idea of the gravity formula, we propose a gravity centrality index to identify the influential spreaders in complex networks. The comparison between the gravity centrality index and some well-known centralities, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and k-shell centrality, and so forth, indicates that our method can effectively identify the influential spreaders in real networks as well as synthetic networks. We also use the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model to verify the good performance of our method.

010       Synchronization in Scale Free networks: The role of finite size effects
021       Synchronization problems in complex networks are very often studied by researchers due to its many applications to various fields such as neurobiology, e-commerce and completion of tasks. 
020       In particular, Scale Free networks with degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, are widely used in research since they are ubiquitous in nature and other real systems. In this paper we focus on the surface relaxation growth model in Scale Free networks with $2.5&lt; \lambda &lt;3$, and study the scaling behavior of the fluctuations, in the steady state, with the system size $N$. We find a novel behavior of the fluctuations characterized by a crossover between two regimes at a value of $N=N^*$ that depends on $\lambda$: a logarithmic regime, found in previous research, and a constant regime. We propose a function that describes this crossover, which is in very good agreement with the simulations. We also find that, for a system size above $N^{*}$, the fluctuations decrease with $\lambda$, which means that the synchronization of the system improves as $\lambda$ increases. We explain this crossover analyzing the role of the network's heterogeneity produced by the system size $N$ and the exponent of the degree distribution.

021       Science is a social process with far-reaching impact on our modern society. 
020       In the recent years, for the first time we are able to scientifically study the science itself. This is enabled by massive amounts of data on scientific publications that is increasingly becoming available. The data is contained in several databases such as Web of Science or PubMed, maintained by various public and private entities. Unfortunately, these databases are not always consistent, which considerably hinders this study. Relying on the powerful framework of complex networks, we conduct a systematic analysis of the consistency among six major scientific databases. We found that identifying a single "best" database is far from easy. Nevertheless, our results indicate appreciable differences in mutual consistency of different databases, which we interpret as recipes for future bibliometric studies.

We give an exact proof of the consistency for the statistical measures, reveal the general linear relation in the degree correlation, which provide a simple and interesting perspective on the analysis of the degree correlation in complex networks. By using the general linear analysis, we investigate the perturbation of the degree correlation in complex networks caused by the addition of few nodes and the rich club. The results show that the assortativity of homogeneous networks such as the ER graphs is easily to be affected strongly by the simple structural changes, while it has only slight variation for heterogeneous networks with broad degree distribution such as the scale-free networks. Clearly, the homogeneous networks are more sensitive for the perturbation than the heterogeneous networks.

010       Fractally-organized Connectionist Networks: Conjectures and Preliminary   Results
021       A strict interpretation of connectionism mandates complex networks of simple components. 
020       The question here is, is this simplicity to be interpreted in absolute terms? I conjecture that absolute simplicity might not be an essential attribute of connectionism, and that it may be effectively exchanged with a requirement for relative simplicity, namely simplicity with respect to the current organizational level. In this paper I provide some elements to the analysis of the above question. In particular I conjecture that fractally organized connectionist networks may provide a convenient means to achive what Leibniz calls an "art of complication", namely an effective way to encapsulate complexity and practically extend the applicability of connectionism to domains such as sociotechnical system modeling and design. Preliminary evidence to my claim is brought by considering the design of the software architecture designed for the telemonitoring service of Flemish project "Little Sister".

010       Novel Multidimensional Models of Opinion Dynamics in Social Networks
021       Unlike many complex networks studied in the literature, social networks rarely exhibit unanimous behavior, or consensus. 
020       This requires a development of mathematical models that are sufficiently simple to be examined and capture, at the same time, the complex behavior of real social groups, where opinions and actions related to them may form clusters of different size. One such model, proposed by Friedkin and Johnsen, extends the idea of conventional consensus algorithm (also referred to as the iterative opinion pooling) to take into account the actors' prejudices, caused by some exogenous factors and leading to disagreement in the final opinions. <br />In this paper, we offer a novel multidimensional extension, describing the evolution of the agents' opinions on several topics. Unlike the existing models, these topics are interdependent, and hence the opinions being formed on these topics are also mutually dependent. We rigorous examine stability properties of the proposed model, in particular, convergence of the agents' opinions. Although our model assumes synchronous communication among the agents, we show that the same final opinions may be reached "on average" via asynchronous gossip-based protocols.

010       Two universal physical principles shape the power-law statistics of   real-world networks
021       The study of complex networks has pursued an understanding of macroscopic behavior by focusing on power-laws in microscopic observables. 
020       Here, we uncover two universal fundamental physical principles that are at the basis of complex networks generation. These principles together predict the generic emergence of deviations from ideal power laws, which were previously discussed away by reference to the thermodynamic limit. Our approach proposes a paradigm shift in the physics of complex networks, toward the use of power-law deviations to infer meso-scale structure from macroscopic observations.

010       Distinct types of eigenvector localization in networks
021       The spectral properties of the adjacency matrix provide a trove of information about the structure and function of complex networks. 
020       In particular, the largest eigenvalue and its associated principal eigenvector are crucial in the understanding of nodes centrality and the unfolding of dynamical processes. Here we show that two distinct types of localization of the principal eigenvector may occur in heterogeneous networks. For synthetic networks with degree distribution $P(q) \sim q^{-\gamma}$, localization occurs on the largest hub if $\gamma&gt;5/2$; for $\gamma&lt;5/2$ a new type of localization arises on a mesoscopic subgraph associated with the shell with the largest index in the $K$-core decomposition. Similar evidence for the existence of distinct localization modes is found in the analysis of real-world networks. Our results open a new perspective on dynamical processes on networks and on a recently proposed alternative measure of node centrality based on the non-backtracking matrix.

010       Emergence of bimodality in controlling complex networks
021       Our ability to control complex systems is a fundamental challenge of contemporary science. 
020       Recently introduced tools to identify the driver nodes, nodes through which we can achieve full control, predict the existence of multiple control configurations, prompting us to classify each node in a network based on their role in control. Accordingly a node is critical, intermittent or redundant if it acts as a driver node in all, some or none of the control configurations. Here we develop an analytical framework to identify the category of each node, leading to the discovery of two distinct control modes in complex systems: centralized vs distributed control. We predict the control mode for an arbitrary network and show that one can alter it through small structural perturbations. The uncovered bimodality has implications from network security to organizational research and offers new insights into the dynamics and control of complex systems.

010       Phase transitions in Pareto optimal complex networks
021       The organization of interactions in complex systems can be described by networks connecting different units. 
020       These graphs are useful representations of the local and global complexity of the underlying systems. The origin of their topological structure can be diverse, resulting from different mechanisms including multiplicative processes and optimization. In spatial networks or in graphs where cost constraints are at work, as it occurs in a plethora of situations from power grids to the wiring of neurons in the brain, optimization plays an important part in shaping their organization. In this paper we study network designs resulting from a Pareto optimization process, where different simultaneous constraints are the targets of selection. We analyze three variations on a problem finding phase transitions of different kinds. Distinct phases are associated to different arrangements of the connections; but the need of drastic topological changes does not determine the presence, nor the nature of the phase transitions encountered. Instead, the functions under optimization do play a determinant role. This reinforces the view that phase transitions do not arise from intrinsic properties of a system alone, but from the interplay of that system with its external constraints.

010       Motif analysis in directed ordered networks and applications to food   webs
021       The analysis of small recurrent substructures, so called network motifs, has become a standard tool of complex network science to unveil the design principles underlying the structure of empirical networks. 
020       In many natural systems network nodes are associated with an intrinsic property according to which they can be ordered and compared against each other. Here, we expand standard motif analysis to be able to capture the hierarchical structure in such ordered networks. Our new approach is based on the identification of all ordered 3-node substructures and the visualization of their significance profile. We present a technique to calculate the fine grained motif spectrum by resolving the individual members of isomorphism classes (sets of substructures formed by permuting node-order). We apply this technique to computer generated ensembles of ordered networks and to empirical food web data, demonstrating the importance of considering node order for food-web analysis. Our approach may not only be helpful to identify hierarchical patterns in empirical food webs and other natural networks, it may also provide the base for extending motif analysis to other types of multi-layered networks.

020       Such an intricate system is approximated by a partitioned open map in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ or $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. The behavior of the quantities is modeled as flowing in the map constructed and thus it is subject to be described by partial differential equations. We follow this approach using the Darcy Porous Media, saturated fluid flow model in mixed variational formulation.

010       Universality at Breakdown of Quantum Transport on Complex Networks
021       We consider single-particle quantum transport on parametrized complex networks. 
020       Based on general arguments regarding the spectrum of the corresponding Hamiltonian, we derive bounds for a measure of the global transport efficiency defined by the time-averaged return probability. For tree-like networks, we show analytically that a transition from efficient to inefficient transport occurs depending on the (average) functionality of the nodes of the network. In the infinite system size limit, this transition can be characterized by an exponent which is universal for all tree-like networks. Our findings are corroborated by analytic results for specific deterministic networks, dendrimers and Viscek fractals, and by Monte Carlo simulations of iteratively built scale-free trees.

010       Probabilistic Constraint Programming for Parameters Optimisation of   Generative Models
021       Complex networks theory has commonly been used for modelling and understanding the interactions taking place between the elements composing complex systems. 
020       More recently, the use of generative models has gained momentum, as they allow identifying which forces and mechanisms are responsible for the appearance of given structural properties. In spite of this interest, several problems remain open, one of the most important being the design of robust mechanisms for finding the optimal parameters of a generative model, given a set of real networks. In this contribution, we address this problem by means of Probabilistic Constraint Programming. By using as an example the reconstruction of networks representing brain dynamics, we show how this approach is superior to other solutions, in that it allows a better characterisation of the parameters space, while requiring a significantly lower computational cost.

010       Heterogeneous nucleation on complex networks with mobile impurities
021       We study the heterogeneous nucleation of Ising model on complex networks under a non-equilibrium situation where the impurities perform degree-biased motion controlled by a parameter \alpha. 
020       Through the forward flux sampling and detailed analysis on the nucleating clusters, we find that the nucleation rate shows a nonmonotonic dependence on \alpha for small number of impurities, in which a maximal nucleation rate occurs at \alpha=0 corresponding to the degree-uncorrelated random motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the distinct features of the nucleating clusters along the pathway for different preference of impurities motion, which may be used to understand the resonance-like dependence of nucleation rate on the motion bias of impurities. Our theoretical analysis shows that the nonequilibrium diffusion of impurities can always induce a positive energy flux that can facilitate the barrier-crossing nucleation process. The nonmonotonic feature of the average value of the energy flux with \alpha may be the origin of our simulation results.

010       Link-Prediction Enhanced Consensus Clustering for Complex Networks
021       Many real networks that are inferred or collected from data are incomplete due to missing edges. 
020       Missing edges can be inherent to the dataset (Facebook friend links will never be complete) or the result of sampling (one may only have access to a portion of the data). The consequence is that downstream analyses that consume the network will often yield less accurate results than if the edges were complete. Community detection algorithms, in particular, often suffer when critical intra-community edges are missing. We propose a novel consensus clustering algorithm to enhance community detection on incomplete networks. Our framework utilizes existing community detection algorithms that process networks imputed by our link prediction based algorithm. The framework then merges their multiple outputs into a final consensus output. On average our method boosts performance of existing algorithms by 7% on artificial data and 17% on ego networks collected from Facebook.

010       The Many Faces of Graph Dynamics
021       The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for several decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and reoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. 
020       However, much less is known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality are not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time. <br />Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution patterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific patterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a "one fits it all" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these intuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables and metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as for interpolating graph evolutions. <br />To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes, this paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node importance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality distance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given centrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances reflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in case of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs. <br />We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and seven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the usefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared to a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the considered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the dynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.

Remarkably, network analyses of thermal imaging time series of contact lens users and patients upon whom Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis (Lasik) surgery has been conducted, exhibit pronounced similarity with results obtained from ADDE patients. We also propose a general framework for the transformation of multidimensional images to networks for futuristic biometry. Our approach is general and scalable to other fluctuation-based devices where network parameters derived from fluctuations, act as effective discriminators and diagnostic markers.

010       Complex Quantum Network Manifolds in Dimension $d&amp;gt;2$ are Scale-Free
021       In quantum gravity, several approaches have been proposed until now for the quantum description of discrete geometries. 
020       These theoretical frameworks include loop quantum gravity, causal dynamical triangulations, causal sets, quantum graphity, and energetic spin networks. Most of these approaches describe discrete spaces as homogeneous network manifolds. Here we define Complex Quantum Network Manifolds (CQNM) describing the evolution of quantum network states, and constructed from growing simplicial complexes of dimension $d$. We show that in $d=2$ CQNM are homogeneous networks while for $d&gt;2$ they are scale-free i.e. they are characterized by large inhomogeneities of degrees like most complex networks. From the self-organized evolution of CQNM quantum statistics emerge spontaneously. Here we define the generalized degrees associated with the $\delta$-faces of the $d$-dimensional CQNMs, and we show that the statistics of these generalized degrees can either follow Fermi-Dirac, Boltzmann or Bose-Einstein distributions depending on the dimension of the $\delta$-faces.

010       Extreme Fluctuations in Stochastic Network Coordination with Time Delays
021       We study the effects of uniform time delays on the extreme fluctuations in stochastic synchronization and coordination problems with linear couplings in complex networks. 
020       We obtain the average size of the fluctuations at the nodes from the behavior of the underlying modes of the network. We then obtain the scaling behavior of the extreme fluctuations with system size, as well as the distribution of the extremes on complex networks, and compare them to those on regular one-dimensional lattices. For large complex networks, when the delay is not too close to the critical one, fluctuations at the nodes effectively decouple, and the limit distributions converge to the Fisher-Tippett-Gumbel density. In contrast, fluctuations in low-dimensional spatial graphs are strongly correlated, and the limit distribution of the extremes is the Airy density. Finally, we also explore the effects of nonlinear couplings on the stability and on the extremes of the synchronization landscapes.

010       Parenclitic network analysis of methylation data for cancer   identification
021       We make use of ideas from the theory of complex networks to implement a machine learning classification of human DNA methylation data, that carry signatures of cancer development. 
020       The data were obtained from patients with various kinds of cancers and represented as parenclictic networks, wherein nodes correspond to genes, and edges are weighted according to pairwise variation from control group subjects. We demonstrate that for the $10$ types of cancer under study, it is possible to obtain a high performance of binary classification between cancer-positive and negative samples based on network measures. Remarkably, an accuracy as high as $93-99\%$ is achieved with only $12$ network topology indices, in a dramatic reduction of complexity from the original $15295$ gene methylation levels. Moreover, it was found that the parenclictic networks are scale-free in cancer-negative subjects, and deviate from the power-law node degree distribution in cancer. The node centrality ranking and arising modular structure could provide insights into the systems biology of cancer.

010       Interpreting communities based on the evolution of a dynamic attributed   network
021       Many methods have been proposed to detect communities, not only in plain, but also in attributed, directed or even dynamic complex networks. 
020       From the modeling point of view, to be of some utility, the community structure must be characterized relatively to the properties of the studied system. However, most of the existing works focus on the detection of communities, and only very few try to tackle this interpretation problem. Moreover, the existing approaches are limited either by the type of data they handle, or by the nature of the results they output. In this work, we see the interpretation of communities as a problem independent from the detection process, consisting in identifying the most characteristic features of communities. We give a formal definition of this problem and propose a method to solve it. To this aim, we first define a sequence-based representation of networks, combining temporal information, community structure, topological measures, and nodal attributes. We then describe how to identify the most emerging sequential patterns of this dataset, and use them to characterize the communities. We study the performance of our method on artificially generated dynamic attributed networks. We also empirically validate our framework on real-world systems: a DBLP network of scientific collaborations, and a LastFM network of social and musical interactions.

010       Fundamental structures of dynamic social networks
021       Social systems are in a constant state of flux with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years. 
020       Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding spreading of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams. While there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the micro-dynamics of social networks. Here we explore the dynamic social network of a densely-connected population of approximately 1000 individuals and their interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts, geo-location, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection unnecessary. Starting from 5-minute time slices we uncover dynamic social structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity. Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores are preceded by coordination behavior in the communication networks, and demonstrating that social behavior can be predicted with high precision.

010       Network-based model of the growth of termite nests
021       We present a model for the growth of the transportation network inside nests of the social insect subfamily Termitinae (Isoptera, termitidae). 
020       These nests consist of large chambers (nodes) connected by tunnels (edges). The model based on the empirical analysis of the real nest networks combined with pruning (edge removal, either random or weighted by betweenness centrality) and a memory effect (preferential growth from the latest added chambers) successfully predicts emergent nest properties (degree distribution, size of the largest connected component, average path lengths, backbone link ratios, and local graph redundancy). The two pruning alternatives can be associated with different genuses in the subfamily. A sensitivity analysis on the pruning and memory parameters indicates that Termitinae networks favor fast internal transportation over efficient defense strategies against ant predators. Our results provide an example of how complex network organization and efficient network properties can be generated from simple building rules based on local interactions and contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that come into play for the formation of termite networks and of biological transportation networks in general.

010       An Efficient homophilic model and Algorithms for Community Detection   using Nash Dynamics
021       The problem of community detection is important as it helps in understanding the spread of information in a social network. 
020       All real complex networks have an inbuilt structure which captures and characterizes the network dynamics between its nodes. Linkages are more likely to form between similar nodes, leading to the formation of some community structure which characterizes the network dynamic. The more friends they have in common, the more the influence that each person can exercise on the other. <br />We propose a disjoint community detection algorithm, $\textit{NashDisjoint}$ that detects disjoint communities in any given network. We evaluate the algorithm $\textit{NashDisjoint}$ on the standard LFR benchmarks, and we find that our algorithm works at least as good as that of the state of the art algorithms for the mixing factors less than 0.55 in all the cases. We propose an overlapping community detection algorithm $\textit{NashOverlap}$ to detect the overlapping communities in any given network. We evaluate the algorithm $\textit{NashOverlap}$ on the standard LFR benchmarks and we find that our algorithm works far better than the state of the art algorithms in around 152 different scenarios, generated by varying the number of nodes, mixing factor and overlapping membership. <br />We run our algorithm $\textit{NashOverlap}$ on DBLP dataset to detect the large collaboration groups and found very interesting results. Also, these results of our algorithm on DBLP collaboration network are compared with the results of the $\textit{COPRA}$ algorithm and $\textit{OSLOM}$.

010       Using network science and text analytics to produce surveys in a   scientific topic
021       The use of science to understand its own structure is becoming popular, but understanding the organization of knowledge areas is still limited because some patterns are only discoverable with proper computational treatment of large-scale datasets. 
020       In this paper, we introduce a network-based methodology combined with text analytics to construct the taxonomy of science fields. The methodology is illustrated with application to two topics: complex networks (CN) and photonic crystals (PC). We built citation networks using data from the Web of Science and used a community detection algorithm for partitioning to obtain science maps of the fields considered. We also created an importance index for text analytics in order to obtain keywords that define the communities. A dendrogram of the relatedness among the subtopics was also obtained. Among the interesting patterns that emerged from the analysis, we highlight the identification of two well-defined communities in PC area, which is consistent with the known existence of two distinct communities of researchers in the area: telecommunication engineers and physicists. With the methodology, it was also possible to assess the interdisciplinary and time evolution of subtopics defined by the keywords. The automatic tools described here are potentially useful not only to provide an overview of scientific areas but also to assist scientists in performing systematic research on a specific topic.

010       Comparing the writing style of real and artificial papers
021       Recent years have witnessed the increase of competition in science. 
020       While promoting the quality of research in many cases, an intense competition among scientists can also trigger unethical scientific behaviors. To increase the total number of published papers, some authors even resort to software tools that are able to produce grammatical, but meaningless scientific manuscripts. Because automatically generated papers can be misunderstood as real papers, it becomes of paramount importance to develop means to identify these scientific frauds. In this paper, I devise a methodology to distinguish real manuscripts from those generated with SCIGen, an automatic paper generator. Upon modeling texts as complex networks (CN), it was possible to discriminate real from fake papers with at least 89\% of accuracy. A systematic analysis of features relevance revealed that the accessibility and betweenness were useful in particular cases, even though the relevance depended upon the dataset. The successful application of the methods described here show, as a proof of principle, that network features can be used to identify scientific gibberish papers. In addition, the CN-based approach can be combined in a straightforward fashion with traditional statistical language processing methods to improve the performance in identifying artificially generated papers.

010       A Faster Algorithm for Fully Dynamic Betweenness Centrality
021       We present a new fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining betweenness centrality (BC) of vertices in a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with positive edge weights. 
020       BC is a widely used parameter in the analysis of large complex networks. We achieve an amortized $O((\nu^*)^2 \log^2 n)$ time per update, where $n = |V| $ and $\nu^*$ bounds the number of distinct edges that lie on shortest paths through any single vertex. This result improves on the amortized bound for fully dynamic BC in [Pontecorvi-Ramachandran2015] by a logarithmic factor. Our algorithm uses new data structures and techniques that are extensions of the method in the fully dynamic algorithm in Thorup [Thorup2004] for APSP in graphs with unique shortest paths. For graphs with $\nu^* = O(n)$, our algorithm matches the fully dynamic APSP bound in [Thorup2004], which holds for graphs with $\nu^* = n-1$, since it assumes unique shortest paths.

010       Doubly Decomposing Nonparametric Tensor Regression
021       Nonparametric extension of tensor regression is proposed. 
020       Nonlinearity in a high-dimensional tensor space is broken into simple local functions by incorporating low-rank tensor decomposition. Compared to naive nonparametric approaches, our formulation considerably improves the convergence rate of estimation while maintaining consistency with the same function class under specific conditions. To estimate local functions, we develop a Bayesian estimator with the Gaussian process prior. Experimental results show its theoretical properties and high performance in terms of predicting a summary statistic of a real complex network.

010       Non-Uniform Distribution of Nodes in the Spatial Preferential Attachment   Model
021       The spatial preferential attachment (SPA) is a model for complex networks. 
020       In the SPA model, nodes are embedded in a metric space, and each node has a sphere of influence whose size increases if the node gains an in-link, and otherwise decreases with time. In this paper, we study the behaviour of the SPA model when the distribution of the nodes is non-uniform. Specifically, the space is divided into dense and sparse regions, where it is assumed that the dense regions correspond to coherent communities. We prove precise theoretical results regarding the degree of a node, the number of common neighbours, and the average out-degree in a region. Moreover, we show how these theoretically derived results about the graph properties of the model can be used to formulate a reliable estimator for the distance between certain pairs of nodes, and to estimate the density of the region containing a given node.

010       Fractional dynamics on networks: Emergence of anomalous diffusion and   L\&#x27;evy flights
021       We introduce a formalism of fractional diffusion on networks based on a fractional Laplacian matrix that can be constructed directly from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. 
020       This fractional approach allows random walks with long-range dynamics providing a general framework for anomalous diffusion and navigation, and inducing dynamically the small-world property on any network. We obtained exact results for the stationary probability distribution, the average fractional return probability and a global time, showing that the efficiency to navigate the network is greater if we use a fractional random walk in comparison to a normal random walk. For the case of a ring, we obtain exact analytical results showing that the fractional transition and return probabilities follow a long-range power-law decay, leading to the emergence of L\'evy flights on networks. Our general fractional diffusion formalism applies to regular, random and complex networks and can be implemented from the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix, providing an important tool to analyze anomalous diffusion on networks.

010       Comprehensive spectral approach for community structure analysis on   complex networks
021       A simple but efficient spectral approach for analyzing the community structure of complex networks is introduced. 
020       It works the same way for all types of networks, by spectrally splitting the adjacency matrix into a "unipartite" and a "multipartite" component. These two matrices reveal the structure of the network from different perspectives and can be analyzed at different levels of detail. Their entries, or the entries of their lower-rank approximations, provide measures of the affinity or antagonism between the nodes that highlight the communities and the "gateway" links that connect them together. An algorithm is then proposed to achieve the automatic assignment of the nodes to communities based on the information provided by either matrix. This algorithm naturally generates overlapping communities but can also be tuned to eliminate the overlaps.

021       Evaluation of link prediction methods is a hard task in very large complex networks because of the inhibitive computational cost.

Specifically, we propose a fast algorithm based on the parallel computing scheme to obtain all the node pairs with CN values larger than the lower bound. Furthermore, we propose a new measurement, called self-predictability, to quantify the performance of the CN-based similarity indices in link prediction, which on the other side can indicate the link predictability of a network.

010       Hierarchical structures in Northern Hemispheric extratropical winter   ocean-atmosphere interactions
021       In recent years extensive studies on the Earth's climate system have been carried out by means of advanced complex network statistics. 
020       The great majority of these studies, however, have been focusing on investigating correlation structures within single climatic fields directly on or parallel to the Earth's surface. Here, we develop a novel approach of node weighted coupled network measures to study correlations between ocean and atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics and construct 18 coupled climate networks, each consisting of two subnetworks. In all cases, one subnetwork represents monthly sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while the other is based on the monthly geopotential height (HGT) of isobaric surfaces at different pressure levels covering the troposphere as well as the lower stratosphere. The weighted cross-degree density proves to be consistent with the leading coupled pattern obtained from maximum covariance analysis. Network measures of higher order allow for a further analysis of the correlation structure between the two fields and consistently indicate that in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics the ocean is correlated with the atmosphere in a hierarchical fashion such that large areas of the ocean surface correlate with multiple statistically dissimilar regions in the atmosphere. Ultimately we show that, this observed hierarchy is linked to large-scale atmospheric variability patterns, such as the Pacific North American pattern, forcing the ocean on monthly time scales.

010       A model of language inflection graphs
021       Inflection graphs are highly complex networks representing relationships between inflectional forms of words in human languages. 
020       For so-called synthetic languages, such as Latin or Polish, they have particularly interesting structure due to abundance of inflectional forms. We construct the simplest form of inflection graphs, namely a bipartite graph in which one group of vertices corresponds to dictionary headwords and the other group to inflected forms encountered in a given text. We then study projection of this graph on the set of headwords. The projection decomposes into a large number of connected components, to be called word groups. Distribution of sizes of word group exhibits some remarkable properties, resembling cluster distribution in a lattice percolation near the critical point. We propose a simple model which produces graphs of this type, reproducing the desired component distribution and other topological features.

010       Random walk centrality in interconnected multilayer networks
021       Real-world complex systems exhibit multiple levels of relationships. 
020       In many cases they require to be modeled as interconnected multilayer networks, characterizing interactions of several types simultaneously. It is of crucial importance in many fields, from economics to biology and from urban planning to social sciences, to identify the most (or the less) influential nodes in a network using centrality measures. However, defining the centrality of actors in interconnected complex networks is not trivial. In this paper, we rely on the tensorial formalism recently proposed to characterize and investigate this kind of complex topologies, and extend two well known random walk centrality measures, the random walk betweenness and closeness centrality, to interconnected multilayer networks. For each of the measures we provide analytical expressions that completely agree with numerically results.

010       Nonlinear Bell inequalities tailored for quantum networks

020       We discuss the characterization of nonlocal correlations in such a situation, when compared to those that can be generated in networks distributing independent local variables. We present an iterative procedure for constructing Bell inequalities tailored for networks: starting from a given network, and a corresponding Bell inequality, our technique provides new Bell inequalities for a more complex network, involving one additional source and one additional observer. The relevance of our method is illustrated on a variety of networks, for which we demonstrate significant quantum violations.

010       Typical distances in a geometric model for complex networks
021       We study typical distances in a geometric random graph on the hyperbolic plane. 
020       Introduced by Krioukov et al.~\cite{ar:Krioukov} as a model for complex networks, $N$ vertices are drawn randomly within a bounded subset of the hyperbolic plane and any two of them are joined if they are within a threshold hyperbolic distance. With appropriately chosen parameters, the random graph is sparse and exhibits power law degree distribution as well as local clustering. In this paper we show a further property: the distance between two uniformly chosen vertices that belong to the same component is doubly logarithmic in $N$, i.e., the graph is an ~\emph{ultra-small world}. More precisely, we show that the distance rescaled by $\log \log N$ converges in probability to a certain constant that depends on the exponent of the power law. The same constant emerges in an analogous setting with the well-known \emph{Chung-Lu} model for which the degree distribution has a power law tail.

010       Classical random walks over complex networks and network complexity
021       In this paper we view the steady states of classical random walks over complex networks with an arbitrary degree distribution as states in thermal equilibrium. 
020       By identifying the distribution of states as a canonical ensemble, we are able to define the temperature and the Hamiltonian for the random walk systems. We then calculate the Helmholtz free energy, the average energy, and the entropy for the thermal equilibrium states. The results shows equipartition of energy for the average energy. The entropy is found to consist of two parts. The first part decreases as the number of walkers increases. The second part of the entropy depends solely on the topology of the network, and will increase when more edges or nodes are added to the network. We compare the topological part of entropy with some of the network descriptors and find that the topological entropy could be used as a measure of network complexity. In addition, we discuss the scenario that a walker has a prior probability of resting on the same node at the next time step, and find that the effect of the prior resting probabilities is equivalent to increasing the degree for every node in the network.

010       Influence maximization in complex networks through optimal percolation
021       The whole frame of interconnections in complex networks hinges on a specific set of structural nodes, much smaller than the total size, which, if activated, would cause the spread of information to the whole network [1]; or, if immunized, would prevent the diffusion of a large scale epidemic [2,3]. 
020       Localizing this optimal, i.e. minimal, set of structural nodes, called influencers, is one of the most important problems in network science [4,5]. Despite the vast use of heuristic strategies to identify influential spreaders [6-14], the problem remains unsolved. Here, we map the problem onto optimal percolation in random networks to identify the minimal set of influencers, which arises by minimizing the energy of a many-body system, where the form of the interactions is fixed by the non-backtracking matrix [15] of the network. Big data analyses reveal that the set of optimal influencers is much smaller than the one predicted by previous heuristic centralities. Remarkably, a large number of previously neglected weakly-connected nodes emerges among the optimal influencers. These are topologically tagged as low-degree nodes surrounded by hierarchical coronas of hubs, and are uncovered only through the optimal collective interplay of all the influencers in the network. Eventually, the present theoretical framework may hold a larger degree of universality, being applicable to other hard optimization problems exhibiting a continuous transition from a known phase [16].

010       Threshold for the Outbreak of Cascading Failures in Degree-degree   Uncorrelated Networks
021       In complex networks, the failure of one or very few nodes may cause cascading failures. 
020       When this dynamical process stops in steady state, the size of the giant component formed by remaining un-failed nodes can be used to measure the severity of cascading failures, which is critically important for estimating the robustness of networks. In this paper, we provide a cascade of overload failure model with local load sharing mechanism, and then explore the threshold of node capacity when the large-scale cascading failures happen and un-failed nodes in steady state cannot connect to each other to form a large connected sub-network. We get the theoretical derivation of this threshold in degree-degree uncorrelated networks, and validate the effectiveness of this method in simulation. This threshold provide us a guidance to improve the network robustness under the premise of limited capacity resource when creating a network and assigning load. Therefore, this threshold is useful and important to analyze the robustness of networks.

010       Rare events statistics of random walks on networks: localization and   other dynamical phase transitions
021       Rare event statistics for random walks on complex networks are investigated using the large deviations formalism. 
020       Within this formalism, rare events are realized as typical events in a suitably deformed path-ensemble, and their statistics can be studied in terms of spectral properties of a deformed Markov transition matrix. We observe two different types of phase transition in such systems: (i) rare events which are singled out for sufficiently large values of the deformation parameter may correspond to {\em localized\/} modes of the deformed transition matrix, (ii) "mode-switching transitions" may occur as the deformation parameter is varied. Details depend on the nature of the observable for which the rare event statistics is studied, as well as on the underlying graph ensemble. In the present letter we report on the statistics of the average degree of the nodes visited along a random walk trajectory in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks. Large deviations rate functions and localization properties are studied numerically. For observables of the type considered here, we also derive an analytical approximation for the Legendre transform of the large-deviations rate function, which is valid in the large connectivity limit. It is found to agree well with simulations.

010       A complex network approach to stylometry
021       Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental properties of language. 
020       In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.

010       Violation of Lee-Yang circle theorem for Ising phase transitions on   complex networks
021       The Ising model on annealed complex networks with degree distribution decaying algebraically as $p(K)\sim K^{-\lambda}$ has a second-order phase transition at finite temperature if $\lambda&gt; 3$. 
020       In the absence of space dimensionality, $\lambda$ controls the transition strength; mean-field theory applies for $\lambda &gt;5$ but critical exponents are $\lambda$-dependent if $\lambda &lt; 5$. Here we show that, as for regular lattices, the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem is obeyed for the former case. However, unlike on regular lattices where it is independent of dimensionality, the circle theorem fails on complex networks when $\lambda &lt; 5$. We discuss the importance of this result for both theory and experiments on phase transitions and critical phenomena. We also investigate the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros in both regimes as well as the multiplicative logarithmic corrections which occur at $\lambda=5$.

010       Logic as a complex network
021       When we represent logical, connective implications by directed edges, the resulting set of directed edges can be regarded as a complex network. 
020       In this article, we compose a network model that represents a deductive-logic-like structure composed solely of implications. The proposed network model grows like the BA model reported by Barabasi and Albert [Science 286, 509 (1999)]. Though the BA model references the whole of the existing network when a node is added, our model references only part of the existing network. In this view, our model is more realistic than the BA model. However, it also exhibits power law characteristics.

010       Delay induced Turing-like waves for one species reaction-diffusion model   on a network
021       A one species time-delay reaction-diffusion system defined on a complex networks is studied. 
020       Travelling waves are predicted to occur as follows a symmetry breaking instability of an homogenous stationary stable solution, subject to an external non homogenous perturbation. These are generalized Turing-like waves that materialize in a single species populations dynamics model, as the unexpected byproduct of the imposed delay in the diffusion part. Sufficient conditions for the onset of the instability are mathematically provided by performing a linear stability analysis adapted to time delayed differential equation. The method here developed exploits the properties of the Lambert W-function. The prediction of the theory are confirmed by direct numerical simulation carried out for a modified version of the classical Fisher model, defined on a Watts-Strogatz networks and with the inclusion of the delay.

020       We study the propagation of influences on manifolds assuming that at each point only a finite number of propagation velocities are allowed. This leads to the computation of the volume of the moduli spaces of directed paths, i.e. paths satisfying the imposed tangential restrictions. The proposed settings provide a fertile ground for research with potential applications in geometry, mathematical physics, differential equations, and combinatorics. We establish the general framework, develop its structural properties, and consider a few basic examples of relevance. The interaction between differential geometry and complex networks is a new and promising field of study.

010       Fast and Simple Computation of Top-k Closeness Centralities
021       Closeness is an important centrality measure widely used in the analysis of real-world complex networks. 
020       In particular, the problem of selecting the k most central nodes with respect to this measure has been deeply analyzed in the last decade. However, even for not very large networks, this problem is computationally intractable in practice: indeed, Abboud et al have recently shown that its complexity is strictly related to the complexity of the All-Pairs Shortest Path (in short, APSP) problem, for which no subcubic "combinatorial" algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for selecting the k most closeness central nodes in a graph. In practice, this algorithm significantly improves over the APSP approach, even though its worst-case time complexity is the same. For example, the algorithm is able to compute the top k nodes in few dozens of seconds even when applied to real-world networks with millions of nodes and edges. We will also experimentally prove that our algorithm drastically outperforms the most recently designed algorithm, proposed by Olsen et al. Finally, we apply the new algorithm to the computation of the most central actors in the IMDB collaboration network, where two actors are linked if they played together in a movie.

010       Unified functional network and nonlinear time series analysis for   complex systems science: The pyunicorn package
021       We introduce the \texttt{pyunicorn} (Pythonic unified complex network and recurrence analysis toolbox) open source software package for applying and combining modern methods of data analysis and modeling from complex network theory and nonlinear time series analysis. 
020       \texttt{pyunicorn} is a fully object-oriented and easily parallelizable package written in the language Python. It allows for the construction of functional networks such as climate networks in climatology or functional brain networks in neuroscience representing the structure of statistical interrelationships in large data sets of time series and, subsequently, investigating this structure using advanced methods of complex network theory such as measures and models for spatial networks, networks of interacting networks, node-weighted statistics or network surrogates. Additionally, \texttt{pyunicorn} provides insights into the nonlinear dynamics of complex systems as recorded in uni- and multivariate time series from a non-traditional perspective by means of recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), recurrence networks, visibility graphs and construction of surrogate time series. The range of possible applications of the library is outlined, drawing on several examples mainly from the field of climatology.

010       Distributed Algorithms for Computation of Centrality Measures in Complex   Networks
021       This paper is concerned with distributed computation of several commonly used centrality measures in complex networks. 
020       In particular, we propose deterministic algorithms, which converge in finite time, for the distributed computation of the degree, closeness and betweenness centrality measures in directed graphs. Regarding eigenvector centrality, we consider the PageRank problem as its typical variant, and design distributed randomized algorithms to compute PageRank for both fixed and time-varying graphs. A key feature of the proposed algorithms is that they do not require to know the network size, which can be simultaneously estimated at every node, and that they are clock-free. To address the PageRank problem of time-varying graphs, we introduce the novel concept of persistent graph, which eliminates the effect of spamming nodes. Moreover, we prove that these algorithms converge almost surely and in the sense of $L^p$. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is illustrated via extensive simulations using a classical benchmark.

010       Self-similar energetics in large clusters of galaxies
021       Massive galaxy clusters are filled with a hot, turbulent and magnetized intra-cluster medium. 
020       Still forming under the action of gravitational instability, they grow in mass by accretion of supersonic flows. These flows partially dissipate into heat through a complex network of large-scale shocks [1], while residual transonic flows create giant turbulent eddies and cascades [2,3]. Turbulence heats the intra-cluster medium [4] and also amplifies magnetic energy by way of dynamo action [5-8]. However, the pattern regulating the transformation of gravitational energy into kinetic, thermal, turbulent and magnetic energies remains unknown. Here we report that the energy components of the intra-cluster medium are ordered according to a permanent hierarchy, in which the ratio of thermal to turbulent to magnetic energy densities remains virtually unaltered throughout the cluster's history, despite evolution of each individual component and the drive towards equipartition of the turbulent dynamo. This result revolves around the approximately constant efficiency of turbulence generation from the gravitational energy that is freed during mass accretion, revealed by our computational model of cosmological structure formation [3,9]. The permanent character of this hierarchy reflects yet another type of self-similarity in cosmology [10-13], while its structure, consistent with current data [14-18], encodes information about the efficiency of turbulent heating and dynamo action.

010       A New Understanding of Friendships in Space: Complex Networks Meet   Twitter
021       Studies on friendships in online social networks involving geographic distance have so far relied on the city location provided in users' profiles. 
020       Consequently, most of the research on friendships have provided accuracy at the city level, at best, to designate a user's location. This study analyzes a Twitter dataset because it provides the exact geographic distance between corresponding users. We start by introducing a strong definition of "friend" on Twitter (i.e., a definition of bidirectional friendship), requiring bidirectional communication. Next, we utilize geo-tagged mentions delivered by users to determine their locations, where "@username" is contained anywhere in the body of tweets. To provide analysis results, we first introduce a friend counting algorithm. From the fact that Twitter users are likely to post consecutive tweets in the static mode, we also introduce a two-stage distance estimation algorithm. As the first of our main contributions, we verify that the number of friends of a particular Twitter user follows a well-known power-law distribution (i.e., a Zipf's distribution or a Pareto distribution). Our study also provides the following newly-discovered friendship degree related to the issue of space: The number of friends according to distance follows a double power-law (i.e., a double Pareto law) distribution, indicating that the probability of befriending a particular Twitter user is significantly reduced beyond a certain geographic distance between users, termed the separation point. Our analysis provides concrete evidence that Twitter can be a useful platform for assigning a more accurate scalar value to the degree of friendship between two users.

010       Complex network based techniques to identify extreme events and (sudden)   transitions in spatio-temporal systems
021       We present here two promising techniques for the application of the complex network approach to continuous spatio-temporal systems that have been developed in the last decade and show large potential for future application and development of complex systems analysis. 
020       First, we discuss the transforming of a time series from such systems to a complex network. The natural approach is to calculate the recurrence matrix and interpret such as the adjacency matrix of an associated complex network, called recurrence network. Using complex network measures, such as transitivity coefficient, we demonstrate that this approach is very efficient for identifying qualitative transitions in observational data, e.g., when analyzing paleoclimate regime transitions. Second, we demonstrate the use of directed spatial networks constructed from spatio-temporal measurements of such systems that can be derived from the synchronized-in-time occurrence of extreme events in different spatial regions. Although there are many possibilities to investigate such spatial networks, we present here the new measure of network divergence and how it can be used to develop a prediction scheme of extreme rainfall events.

021       In this paper, we want to study the informative value of negative links in signed complex networks. 
020       For this purpose, we extract and analyze a collection of signed networks representing voting sessions of the European Parliament (EP). We first process some data collected by the VoteWatch Europe Website for the whole 7 th term (2009-2014), by considering voting similarities between Members of the EP to define weighted signed links. We then apply a selection of community detection algorithms, designed to process only positive links, to these data. We also apply Parallel Iterative Local Search (Parallel ILS), an algorithm recently proposed to identify balanced partitions in signed networks. Our results show that, contrary to the conclusions of a previous study focusing on other data, the partitions detected by ignoring or considering the negative links are indeed remarkably different for these networks. The relevance of negative links for graph partitioning therefore is an open question which should be further explored.

010       Cycle representatives for the coarse-graining of systems driven into a   non-equilibrium steady state
021       A major current challenge poses the systematic construction of coarse-grained models that are dynamically consistent, and, moreover, might be used for systems driven out of thermal equilibrium. 
020       Here we present a novel prescription that extends the Markov state modelling approach to driven systems. The first step is to construct a complex network of microstates from detailed atomistic simulations with transition rates that break detailed balance. The coarse-graining is then carried out in the cycle space of this network. To this end we introduce the concept of representatives, which stand for many cycles with similar properties. We show how to find these cycle communities using well-developed standard algorithms. Removing all cycles except for the representatives defines the coarse-grained model, which is mapped back onto a network with far fewer states and renormalized transition rates that, however, preserve the entropy production of the original network. Our approach is illustrated and validated for a single driven particle.

010       Complete Characterization of Stability of Cluster Synchronization in   Complex Dynamical Networks
021       Synchronization is an important and prevalent phenomenon in natural and engineered systems. 
020       In many dynamical networks, the coupling is balanced or adjusted in order to admit global synchronization, a condition called Laplacian coupling. Many networks exhibit incomplete synchronization, where two or more clusters of synchronization persist, and computational group theory has recently proved to be valuable in discovering these cluster states based upon the topology of the network. In the important case of Laplacian coupling, additional synchronization patterns can exist that would not be predicted from the group theory analysis alone. The understanding of how and when clusters form, merge, and persist is essential for understanding collective dynamics, synchronization, and failure mechanisms of complex networks such as electric power grids, distributed control networks, and autonomous swarming vehicles. We describe here a method to find and analyze all of the possible cluster synchronization patterns in a Laplacian-coupled network, by applying methods of computational group theory to dynamically-equivalent networks. We present a general technique to evaluate the stability of each of the dynamically valid cluster synchronization patterns. Our results are validated in an electro-optic experiment on a 5 node network that confirms the synchronization patterns predicted by the theory.

010       Traffic-driven epidemic spreading in correlated networks
021       In spite of the extensive previous efforts on traffic dynamics and epidemic spreading in complex networks, the problem of traffic-driven epidemic spreading on {\em correlated} networks has not been addressed. 
020       Interestingly, we find that the epidemic threshold, a fundamental quantity underlying the spreading dynamics, exhibits a non-monotonic behavior in that it can be minimized for some critical value of the assortativity coefficient, a parameter characterizing the network correlation. To understand this phenomenon, we use the degree-based mean-field theory to calculate the traffic-driven epidemic threshold for correlated networks. The theory predicts that the threshold is inversely proportional to the packet-generation rate and the largest eigenvalue of the betweenness matrix. We obtain consistency between theory and numerics. Our results may provide insights into the important problem of controlling/harnessing real-world epidemic spreading dynamics driven by traffic flows.

010       Collective Relaxation Dynamics of Small-World Networks
021       Complex networks exhibit a wide range of collective dynamic phenomena, including synchronization, diffusion, relaxation, and coordination processes. 
020       Their asymptotic dynamics is generically characterized by the local Jacobian, graph Laplacian or a similar linear operator. The structure of networks with regular, small-world and random connectivities are reasonably well understood, but their collective dynamical properties remain largely unknown. Here we present a two-stage mean-field theory to derive analytic expressions for network spectra. A single formula covers the spectrum from regular via small-world to strongly randomized topologies in Watts-Strogatz networks, explaining the simultaneous dependencies on network size N, average degree k and topological randomness q. We present simplified analytic predictions for the second largest and smallest eigenvalue, and numerical checks confirm our theoretical predictions for zero, small and moderate topological randomness q, including the entire small-world regime. For large q of the order of one, we apply standard random matrix theory thereby overarching the full range from regular to randomized network topologies. These results may contribute to our analytic and mechanistic understanding of collective relaxation phenomena of network dynamical systems.

010       Upper bounds for number of removed edges in the Erased Configuration   Model
021       Models for generating simple graphs are important in the study of real-world complex networks. 
020       A well established example of such a model is the erased configuration model, where each node receives a number of half-edges that are connected to half-edges of other nodes at random, and then self-loops are removed and multiple edges are concatenated to make the graph simple. Although asymptotic results for many properties of this model, such as the limiting degree distribution, are known, the exact speed of convergence in terms of the graph sizes remains an open question. We provide a first answer by analyzing the size dependence of the average number of removed edges in the erased configuration model. By combining known upper bounds with a Tauberian Theorem we obtain upper bounds for the number of removed edges, in terms of the size of the graph. Remarkably, when the degree distribution follows a power-law, we observe three scaling regimes, depending on the power law exponent. Our results provide a strong theoretical basis for evaluating finite-size effects in networks.

010       Deterministic hierarchical networks
021       It has been shown that many networks associated with complex systems are small-world (they have both a large local clustering coefficient and a small diameter) and they are also scale-free (the degrees are distributed according to a power law). 
020       Moreover, these networks are very often hierarchical, as they describe the modularity of the systems that are modeled. Most of the studies for complex networks are based on stochastic methods. However, a deterministic method, with an exact determination of the main relevant parameters of the networks, has proven useful. Indeed, this approach complements and enhances the probabilistic and simulation techniques and, therefore, it provides a better understanding of the systems modeled. In this paper we find the radius, diameter, clustering coefficient and degree distribution of a generic family of deterministic hierarchical small-world scale-free networks that has been considered for modeling real-life complex systems.

010       Structural and Spectral properties of Corona Graphs
021       Product graphs have been gainfully used in literature to generate mathematical models of complex networks which inherit properties of real networks. 
020       Realizing the duplication phenomena imbibed in the definition of corona product of two graphs, we define Corona graphs. Given a small simple connected graph which we call seed graph, Corona graphs are defined by taking corona product of a seed graph iteratively. We show that the cumulative degree distribution of Corona graphs decay exponentially when the seed graph is regular and cumulative betweenness distribution follows power law when seed graph is a clique. We determine explicit formulae of eigenvalues, Laplacian eigenvalues and signless Laplacian eigenvalues of Corona graphs when the seed graph is regular. Computable expressions of eigenvalues and signless Laplacian eigenvalues of Corona graphs are also obtained when the seed graph is a star graph.

010       Minimum Sensor Placement for Robust Observability of Structured Complex   Networks
021       This paper addresses problems on the robust structural design of complex networks. 
020       More precisely, we address the problem of deploying the minimum number of dedicated sensors, i.e., those measuring a single state variable, that ensure the network to be structurally observable under disruptive scenarios. The disruptive scenarios considered are as follows: (i) the malfunction/loss of one arbitrary sensor, and (ii) the failure of connection (either unidirectional or bidirectional communication) between a pair of agents. First, we show these problems to be NP-hard, which implies that efficient algorithms to determine a solution are unlikely to exist. Secondly, we propose an intuitive two step approach: (1) we achieve an arbitrary minimum sensor placement ensuring structural observability; (2) we develop a sequential process to find minimum number of additional sensors required for robust observability. This step can be solved by recasting it as a weighted set covering problem. Although this is known to be an NP-hard problem, feasible approximations can be determined in polynomial-time that can be used to obtain feasible approximations to the robust structural design problems with optimality guarantees.

010       Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in 3D electrospun nanofiber mats   coated with gold nanorods
021       Nanofibers functionalized by metal nanostructures and particles are exploited as effective flexible substrates for SERS analysis. 
020       Their complex three-dimensional structure may provide Raman signals enhanced by orders of magnitude compared to untextured surfaces. Understanding the origin of such improved performances is therefore very important for pushing nanofiber-based analytical technologies to their upper limit. Here we report on polymer nanofiber mats which can be exploited as substrates for enhancing the Raman spectra of adsorbed probe molecules. The increased surface area and the scattering of light in the nanofibrous system are individually analyzed as mechanisms to enhance Raman scattering. The deposition of gold nanorods on the fibers further amplifies Raman signals due to SERS. This study suggests that Raman signals can be finely tuned in intensity and effectively enhanced in nanofiber mats and arrays by properly tailoring the architecture, composition, and light-scattering properties of the complex networks of filaments.

010       Classifying informative and imaginative prose using complex networks
021       Statistical methods have been widely employed in recent years to grasp many language properties. 
020       The application of such techniques have allowed an improvement of several linguistic applications, which encompasses machine translation, automatic summarization and document classification. In the latter, many approaches have emphasized the semantical content of texts, as it is the case of bag-of-word language models. This approach has certainly yielded reasonable performance. However, some potential features such as the structural organization of texts have been used only on a few studies. In this context, we probe how features derived from textual structure analysis can be effectively employed in a classification task. More specifically, we performed a supervised classification aiming at discriminating informative from imaginative documents. Using a networked model that describes the local topological/dynamical properties of function words, we achieved an accuracy rate of up to 95%, which is much higher than similar networked approaches. A systematic analysis of feature relevance revealed that symmetry and accessibility measurements are among the most prominent network measurements. Our results suggest that these measurements could be used in related language applications, as they play a complementary role in characterizing texts.

010       Small-world structure induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity in   networks with critical dynamics
021       The small-world property in the context of complex networks implies structural benefits to the processes taking place within a network, such as optimal information transmission and robustness. 
020       In this paper, we study a model network of integrate-and-fire neurons that are subject to activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. We find the learning rule that gives rise to a small-world structure when the collective dynamics of the system reaches a critical state which is characterised by power-law distributions of activity clusters. Moreover, by analysing the motif profile of the networks, we observe that bidirectional connectivity is impaired by the effects of this type of plasticity.

010       The success of complex networks at criticality
021       In spiking neural networks an action potential could in principle trigger subsequent spikes in the neighbourhood of the initial neuron. 
020       A successful spike is that which trigger subsequent spikes giving rise to cascading behaviour within the system. In this study we introduce a metric to assess the success of spikes emitted by integrate-and-fire neurons arranged in complex topologies and whose collective behaviour is undergoing a phase transition that is identified by neuronal avalanches that become clusters of activation whose distribution of sizes can be approximated by a power-law. In numerical simulations we report that scale-free networks with the small-world property is the structure in which neurons possess more successful spikes. As well, we conclude both analytically and in numerical simulations that fully-connected networks are structures in which neurons perform worse. Additionally, we study how the small-world property affects spiking behaviour and its success in scale-free networks.

010       Sensing and Control in Symmetric Networks
021       In engineering applications, one of the major challenges today is to develop reliable and robust control algorithms for complex networked systems. 
020       Controllability and observability of such systems play a crucial role in the design process. The underlying network structure may contain symmetries -- caused for example by the coupling of identical building blocks -- and these symmetries lead to repeated eigenvalues in a generic way. This complicates the design of controllers since repeated eigenvalues might decrease the controllability of the system. In this paper, we will analyze the relationship between the controllability and observability of complex networked systems and graph symmetries using results from representation theory. Furthermore, we will propose an algorithm to compute sparse input and output matrices based on projections onto the isotypic components. We will illustrate our results with the aid of two guiding examples, a network with $ D_4 $ symmetry and the Petersen graph.

010       Highly intensive data dissemination in complex networks
021       This paper presents a study on data dissemination in unstructured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network overlays. 
020       The absence of a structure in unstructured overlays eases the network management, at the cost of non-optimal mechanisms to spread messages in the network. Thus, dissemination schemes must be employed that allow covering a large portion of the network with a high probability (e.g.~gossip based approaches). We identify principal metrics, provide a theoretical model and perform the assessment evaluation using a high performance simulator that is based on a parallel and distributed architecture. A main point of this study is that our simulation model considers implementation technical details, such as the use of caching and Time To Live (TTL) in message dissemination, that are usually neglected in simulations, due to the additional overhead they cause. Outcomes confirm that these technical details have an important influence on the performance of dissemination schemes and that the studied schemes are quite effective to spread information in P2P overlay networks, whatever their topology. Moreover, the practical usage of such dissemination mechanisms requires a fine tuning of many parameters, the choice between different network topologies and the assessment of behaviors such as free riding. All this can be done only using efficient simulation tools to support both the network design phase and, in some cases, at runtime.

010       Resource location based on precomputed partial random walks in dynamic   networks
021       The problem of finding a resource residing in a network node (the \emph{resource location problem}) is a challenge in complex networks due to aspects as network size, unknown network topology, and network dynamics. 
020       The problem is especially difficult if no requirements on the resource placement strategy or the network structure are to be imposed, assuming of course that keeping centralized resource information is not feasible or appropriate. Under these conditions, random algorithms are useful to search the network. A possible strategy for static networks, proposed in previous work, uses short random walks precomputed at each network node as partial walks to construct longer random walks with associated resource information. In this work, we adapt the previous mechanisms to dynamic networks, where resource instances may appear in, and disappear from, network nodes, and the nodes themselves may leave and join the network, resembling realistic scenarios. We analyze the resulting resource location mechanisms, providing expressions that accurately predict average search lengths, which are validated using simulation experiments. Reduction of average search lengths compared to simple random walk searches are found to be very large, even in the face of high network volatility. We also study the cost of the mechanisms, focusing on the overhead implied by the periodic recomputation of partial walks to refresh the information on resources, concluding that the proposed mechanisms behave efficiently and robustly in dynamic networks.

010       Multilayer Network of Language: a Unified Framework for Structural   Analysis of Linguistic Subsystems
021       Recently, the focus of complex networks research has shifted from the analysis of isolated properties of a system toward a more realistic modeling of multiple phenomena - multilayer networks. 
020       Motivated by the prosperity of multilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the introduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of language is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their structural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions. Various aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex networks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their relations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the network construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of interest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and its shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network layers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The obtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the networks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during the exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural properties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the syllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties. The preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers in weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a close topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both languages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a powerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic subsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.

010       Asymptotic Mutual Information for the Two-Groups Stochastic Block Model
021       We develop an information-theoretic view of the stochastic block model, a popular statistical model for the large-scale structure of complex networks. 
020       A graph $G$ from such a model is generated by first assigning vertex labels at random from a finite alphabet, and then connecting vertices with edge probabilities depending on the labels of the endpoints. In the case of the symmetric two-group model, we establish an explicit `single-letter' characterization of the per-vertex mutual information between the vertex labels and the graph. <br />The explicit expression of the mutual information is intimately related to estimation-theoretic quantities, and --in particular-- reveals a phase transition at the critical point for community detection. Below the critical point the per-vertex mutual information is asymptotically the same as if edges were independent. Correspondingly, no algorithm can estimate the partition better than random guessing. Conversely, above the threshold, the per-vertex mutual information is strictly smaller than the independent-edges upper bound. In this regime there exists a procedure that estimates the vertex labels better than random guessing.

010       Recoverable DTN Routing based on a Relay of Cyclic Message-Ferries on a   MSQ Network
021       An interrelation between a topological design of network and efficient algorithm on it is important for its applications to communication or transportation systems. 
020       In this paper, we propose a design principle for a reliable routing in a store-carry-forward manner based on autonomously moving message-ferries on a special structure of fractal-like network, which consists of a self-similar tiling of equilateral triangles. As a collective adaptive mechanism, the routing is realized by a relay of cyclic message-ferries corresponded to a concatenation of the triangle cycles and using some good properties of the network structure. It is recoverable for local accidents in the hierarchical network structure. Moreover, the design principle is theoretically supported with a calculation method for the optimal service rates of message-ferries derived from a tandem queue model for stochastic processes on a chain of edges in the network. These results obtained from a combination of complex network science and computer science will be useful for developing a resilient network system.

010       Path statistics, memory, and coarse-graining of continuous-time random   walks on networks
021       Continuous-time random walks (CTRWs) on discrete state spaces, ranging from regular lattices to complex networks, are ubiquitous across physics, chemistry, and biology. 
020       Models with coarse-grained states, for example those employed in studies of molecular kinetics, and models with spatial disorder can give rise to memory and non-exponential distributions of waiting times and first-passage statistics. However, existing methods for analyzing CTRWs on complex energy landscapes do not address these effects. We therefore use statistical mechanics of the nonequilibrium path ensemble to characterize first-passage CTRWs on networks with arbitrary connectivity, energy landscape, and waiting time distributions. Our approach is valuable for calculating higher moments (beyond the mean) of path length, time, and action, as well as statistics of any conservative or non-conservative force along a path. For homogeneous networks we derive exact relations between length and time moments, quantifying the validity of approximating a continuous-time process with its discrete-time projection. For more general models we obtain recursion relations, reminiscent of transfer matrix and exact enumeration techniques, to efficiently calculate path statistics numerically. We have implemented our algorithm in PathMAN, a Python script that users can easily apply to their model of choice. We demonstrate the algorithm on a few representative examples which underscore the importance of non-exponential distributions, memory, and coarse-graining in CTRWs.

010       Distribution of maximal clique size of the vertices for theoretical   small-world networks and real-world networks
021       Our primary objective in this paper is to study the distribution of the maximal clique size of the vertices in complex networks. 
020       We define the maximal clique size for a vertex as the maximum size of the clique that the vertex is part of and such a clique need not be the maximum size clique for the entire network. We determine the maximal clique size of the vertices using a modified version of a branch-and-bound based exact algorithm that has been originally proposed to determine the maximum size clique for an entire network graph. We then run this algorithm on two categories of complex networks: One category of networks capture the evolution of small-world networks from regular network (according to the wellknown Watts-Strogatz model) and their subsequent evolution to random networks; we show that the distribution of the maximal clique size of the vertices follows a Poisson-style distribution at different stages of the evolution of the small-world network to a random network; on the other hand, the maximal clique size of the vertices is observed to be in-variant and to be very close to that of the maximum clique size for the entire network graph as the regular network is transformed to a small-world network. The second category of complex networks studied are real-world networks (ranging from random networks to scale-free networks) and we observe the maximal clique size of the vertices in five of the six real-world networks to follow a Poisson-style distribution. In addition to the above case studies, we also analyze the correlation between the maximal clique size and clustering coefficient as well as analyze the assortativity index of the vertices with respect to maximal clique size and node degree.

010       Change point detection in Network models: Preferential attachment and   long range dependence
021       Inspired by empirical data on real world complex networks, the last few years have seen an explosion in proposed generative models to understand and explain observed properties of real world networks, including power law degree distribution and "small world" distance scaling. 
020       In this context, a natural question is the phenomenon of {\it change point}, understanding how abrupt changes in parameters driving the network model change structural properties of the network. We study this phenomenon in one popular class of dynamically evolving networks: preferential attachment models. We derive asymptotic properties of various functionals of the network including the degree distribution as well as maximal degree asymptotics, in essence showing that the change point does effect the degree distribution but does {\bf not} change the degree exponent. This provides further evidence for long range dependence and sensitive dependence of the evolution of the process on the initial evolution of the process in such self-reinforced systems. We then propose an estimator for the change point and prove consistency properties of this estimator. The methodology developed highlights the effect of the non-ergodic nature of the evolution of the network on classical change point estimators.

010       Microscopic Analysis of the Uplink Interference in FDMA Small Cell   Networks
021       In this paper, we analytically derive an upper bound on the error in approximating the uplink (UL) single-cell interference by a lognormal distribution in frequency division multiple access (FDMA) small cell networks (SCNs). 
020       Such an upper bound is measured by the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) distance between the actual cumulative density function (CDF) and the approximate CDF. The lognormal approximation is important because it allows tractable network performance analysis. Our results are more general than the existing works in the sense that we do not pose any requirement on (i) the shape and/or size of cell coverage areas, (ii) the uniformity of user equipment (UE) distribution, and (iii) the type of multi-path fading. Based on our results, we propose a new framework to directly and analytically investigate a complex network with practical deployment of multiple BSs placed at irregular locations, using a power lognormal approximation of the aggregate UL interference. The proposed network performance analysis is particularly useful for the 5th generation (5G) systems with general cell deployment and UE distribution.

010       Fundamental limitations of network reconstruction
021       Network reconstruction is the first step towards understanding, diagnosing and controlling the dynamics of complex networked systems. 
020       It allows us to infer properties of the interaction matrix, which characterizes how nodes in a system directly interact with each other. Despite a decade of extensive studies, network reconstruction remains an outstanding challenge. The fundamental limitations governing which properties of the interaction matrix (e.g., adjacency pattern, sign pattern and degree sequence) can be inferred from given temporal data of individual nodes remain unknown. Here we rigorously derive necessary conditions to reconstruct any property of the interaction matrix. These conditions characterize how uncertain can we be about the coupling functions that characterize the interactions between nodes, and how informative does the measured temporal data need to be; rendering two classes of fundamental limitations of network reconstruction. Counterintuitively, we find that reconstructing any property of the interaction matrix is generically as difficult as reconstructing the interaction matrix itself, requiring equally informative temporal data. Revealing these fundamental limitations shed light on the design of better network reconstruction algorithms, which offer practical improvements over existing methods.

010       Hierarchical mutual information for the comparison of hierarchical   community structures in complex networks
021       The quest for a quantitative characterization of community and modular structure of complex networks produced a variety of methods and algorithms to classify different networks. 
020       However, it is not clear if such methods provide consistent, robust and meaningful results when considering hierarchies as a whole. Part of the problem is the lack of a similarity measure for the comparison of hierarchical community structures. In this work we give a contribution by introducing the {\it hierarchical mutual information}, which is a generalization of the traditional mutual information, and allows to compare hierarchical partitions and hierarchical community structures. The {\it normalized} version of the hierarchical mutual information should behave analogously to the traditional normalized mutual information. Here, the correct behavior of the hierarchical mutual information is corroborated on an extensive battery of numerical experiments. The experiments are performed on artificial hierarchies, and on the hierarchical community structure of artificial and empirical networks. Furthermore, the experiments illustrate some of the practical applications of the hierarchical mutual information. Namely, the comparison of different community detection methods, and the study of the consistency, robustness and temporal evolution of the hierarchical modular structure of networks.

010       Time Series Clustering via Community Detection in Networks
021       In this paper, we propose a technique for time series clustering using community detection in complex networks. 
020       Firstly, we present a method to transform a set of time series into a network using different distance functions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most similar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to identify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and, consequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series distance functions, network generation methods and community detection techniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed network-based approach achieves better results than various classic or up-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm that the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such as $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns presented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying network constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other techniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is robust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time shifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed method is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to topological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only for time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.

010       Control Principles of Complex Networks
021       A reflection of our ultimate understanding of a complex system is our ability to control its behavior. 
020       Typically, control has multiple prerequisites: It requires an accurate map of the network that governs the interactions between the system's components, a quantitative description of the dynamical laws that govern the temporal behavior of each component, and an ability to influence the state and temporal behavior of a selected subset of the components. With deep roots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the intricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network topology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the components. We match the pertinent mathematical results with empirical findings and applications. We show that uncovering the control principles of complex systems can help us explore and ultimately understand the fundamental laws that govern their behavior.

010       Network Community Detection on Metric Space
021       Community detection in a complex network is an important problem of much interest in recent years. 
020       In general, a community detection algorithm chooses an objective function and captures the communities of the network by optimizing the objective function, and then, one uses various heuristics to solve the optimization problem to extract the interesting communities for the user. In this article, we demonstrate the procedure to transform a graph into points of a metric space and develop the methods of community detection with the help of a metric defined for a pair of points. We have also studied and analyzed the community structure of the network therein. The results obtained with our approach are very competitive with most of the well-known algorithms in the literature, and this is justified over the large collection of datasets. On the other hand, it can be observed that time taken by our algorithm is quite less compared to other methods and justifies the theoretical findings.

010       Quantifying Complexity in Quantum Phase Transitions via Mutual   Information Complex Networks
021       We quantify the emergent complexity of quantum states near quantum critical points on regular 1D lattices, via complex network measures based on quantum mutual information as the adjacency matrix, in direct analogy to quantifying the complexity of EEG/fMRI measurements of the brain. 
020       Using matrix product state methods, we show that network density, clustering, disparity, and Pearson's correlation obtain the critical point for both quantum Ising and Bose-Hubbard models to a high degree of accuracy in finite-size scaling for three classes of quantum phase transitions, $Z_2$, mean field superfluid/Mott insulator, and a BKT crossover.

010       Synchronization versus neighborhood similarity in complex networks of   non-identical oscillators
021       Does the assignment order of a fixed collection of slightly distinct subsystems into given communication channels influence the overall ensemble behavior? We discuss this question in the context of complex networks of non-identical interacting oscillators. 
020       Three connection configurations found in Nature are considered here: Similar, Dissimilar and Neutral patterns. These strategies correspond respectively to oscillators alike, distinct and indifferent relate to its neighbors. To construct such scenarios we define a vertex weighted graph measure, the Total Dissonance, which comprises the sum of the dissonances between all neighbor oscillators in the network. Our numerical simulations show that the more homogeneous is a network, the higher tend to be both the coupling strength required to phase-locking and the associated final phase configuration spread over the circle. On the other hand, the initial spread of partial synchronization occurs faster for Similar patterns in comparison to Dissimilar ones, while neutral patterns are an intermediate situation between both extremes.

These challenges concern the multilayer structure of most of the networks, the formulation of a network geometry and topology, and the development of a quantum theory of networks. Making progress on these aspects of network theory can open new venues to address interdisciplinary and physics challenges including progress on brain dynamics, new insights into quantum technologies, and quantum gravity.

010       Layer-layer competition in multiplex complex networks
021       The coexistence of multiple types of interactions within social, technological and biological networks has moved the focus of the physics of complex systems towards a multiplex description of the interactions between their constituents. 
020       This novel approach has unveiled that the multiplex nature of complex systems has strong influence in the emergence of collective states and their critical properties. Here we address an important issue that is intrinsic to the coexistence of multiple means of interactions within a network: their competition. To this aim, we study a two-layer multiplex in which the activity of users can be localized in each of the layer or shared between them, favoring that neighboring nodes within a layer focus their activity on the same layer. This framework mimics the coexistence and competition of multiple communication channels, in a way that the prevalence of a particular communication platform emerges as a result of the localization of users activity in one single interaction layer. Our results indicate that there is a transition from localization (use of a preferred layer) to delocalization (combined usage of both layers) and that the prevalence of a particular layer (in the localized state) depends on their structural properties.

010       Interplay between the local information based behavioral responses and   the epidemic spreading in complex networks
021       The spreading of an infectious disease can trigger human behavior responses to the disease, which in turn plays a crucial role on the spreading of epidemic. 
020       In this study, to illustrate the impacts of the human behavioral responses, a new class of individuals, $S^F$, is introduced to the classical susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$) model. In the model, $S^F$ state represents that susceptible individuals who take self-initiate protective measures to lower the probability of being infected, and a susceptible individual may go to $S^F$ state with a response rate when contacting an infectious neighbor. Via the percolation method, the theoretical formulas for the epidemic threshold as well as the prevalence of epidemic are derived. Our finding indicates that, with the increasing of the response rate, the epidemic threshold is enhanced and the prevalence of epidemic is reduced. The analytical results are also verified by the numerical simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that, because the mean field method neglects the dynamic correlations, a wrong result based on the mean field method is obtained---the epidemic threshold is not related to the response rate, i.e., the additional $S^F$ state has no impact on the epidemic threshold.

010       The role of adjacency matrix degeneration in maximum entropy weighted   network models
021       Complex network null models based on entropy maximization are becoming a powerful tool to characterize and analyze data from real systems. 
020       However, it is not easy to extract good and unbiased information from these models: A proper understanding of the nature of the underlying events represented in them is crucial. In this paper we emphasize this fact stressing how an accurate counting of configurations compatible with given constraints is fundamental to build good null models for the case of networks with integer valued adjacency matrices constructed from aggregation of one or multiple layers. We show how different assumptions about the elements from which the networks are built give rise to distinctively different statistics, even when considering the same observables to match those of real data. We illustrate our findings by applying the formalism to three datasets using an open-source software package accompanying the present work and demonstrate how such differences are clearly seen when measuring network observables.

The numerical analysis is performed in the general framework of gradient discretizations which is extended to the model under consideration. Two families of schemes namely the Vertex Approximate Gradient scheme (VAG) and the Hybrid Finite Volume scheme (HFV) are detailed and shown to satisfy the gradient scheme framework, which yields, in particular, convergence.

010       Gramian-based reachability metrics for bilinear networks
021       This paper studies Gramian-based reachability metrics for bilinear control systems. 
020       In the context of complex networks, bilinear systems capture scenarios where an actuator not only can affect the state of a node but also interconnections among nodes. Under the assumption that the input's infinity norm is bounded by some function of the network dynamic matrices, we derive a Gramian-based lower bound on the minimum input energy required to steer the state from the origin to any reachable target state. This result motivates our study of various objects associated to the reachability Gramian to quantify the ease of controllability of the bilinear network: the minimum eigenvalue (worst-case minimum input energy to reach a state), the trace (average minimum input energy to reach a state), and its determinant (volume of the ellipsoid containing the reachable states using control inputs with no more than unit energy). We establish an increasing returns property of the reachability Gramian as a function of the actuators, which in turn allows us to derive a general lower bound on the reachability metrics in terms of the aggregate contribution of the individual actuators. We conclude by examining the effect on the worst-case minimum input energy of the addition of bilinear inputs to difficult-to-control linear symmetric networks. We show that the bilinear networks resulting from the addition of either inputs at a finite number of interconnections or at all self loops with weight vanishing with the network scale remain difficult-to-control. Various examples illustrate our results.

010       The robustness of multiplex networks under layer node-based attack
021       From transportation networks to complex infrastructures, and to social and economic networks, a large variety of systems can be described in terms of multiplex networks formed by a set of nodes interacting through different network layers. 
020       Network robustness, as one of the most successful application areas of complex networks, has also attracted great interest in both theoretical and empirical researches. However, the vast majority of existing researches mainly focus on the robustness of single-layer networks an interdependent networks, how multiplex networks respond to potential attack is still short of further exploration. Here we study the robustness of multiplex networks under two attack strategies: layer node-based random attack and layer node-based targeted attack. A theoretical analysis framework is proposed to calculate the critical threshold and the size of giant component of multiplex networks when a fraction of layer nodes are removed randomly or intentionally. Via numerous simulations, it is unveiled that the theoretical method can accurately predict the threshold and the size of giant component, irrespective of attack strategies. Moreover, we also compare the robustness of multiplex networks under multiplex node-based attack and layer node-based attack, and find that layer node-based attack makes multiplex networks more vulnerable, regardless of average degree and underlying topology. Our finding may shed new light on the protection of multiplex networks.

021       In this paper, we investigate the linear controllability framework for complex networks from a physical point of view. 
020       There are three main results. (1) If one applies control signals as determined from the structural controllability theory, there is a high probability that the control energy will diverge. Especially, if a network is deemed controllable using a single driving signal, then most likely the energy will diverge. (2) The energy required for control exhibits a power-law scaling behavior. (3) Applying additional control signals at proper nodes in the network can reduce and optimize the energy cost. We identify the fundamental structures embedded in the network, the longest control chains, which determine the control energy and give rise to the power-scaling behavior. (To our knowledge, this was not reported in any previous work on control of complex networks.) In addition, the issue of control precision is addressed. These results are supported by extensive simulations from model and real networks, physical reasoning, and mathematical analyses. <br />Notes on the submission history of this work: This work started in late 2012. The phenomena of power-law energy scaling and energy divergence with a single controller were discovered in 2013. Strategies to reduce and optimize control energy was articulated and tested in 2013. The senior co-author (YCL) gave talks about these results at several conferences, including the NETSCI 2014 Satellite entitled "Controlling Complex Networks" on June 2, 2014. The paper was submitted to PNAS in September 2014 and was turned down. It was revised and submitted to PRX in early 2015 and was rejected. After that it was revised and submitted to Nature Communications in May 2015 and again was turned down.

010       Control of stochastic and induced switching in biophysical networks
021       Noise caused by fluctuations at the molecular level is a fundamental part of intracellular processes. 
020       While the response of biological systems to noise has been studied extensively, there has been limited understanding of how to exploit it to induce a desired cell state. Here we present a scalable, quantitative method based on the Freidlin-Wentzell action to predict and control noise-induced switching between different states in genetic networks that, conveniently, can also control transitions between stable states in the absence of noise. We apply this methodology to models of cell differentiation and show how predicted manipulations of tunable factors can induce lineage changes, and further utilize it to identify new candidate strategies for cancer therapy in a cell death pathway model. This framework offers a systems approach to identifying the key factors for rationally manipulating biophysical dynamics, and should also find use in controlling other classes of noisy complex networks.

010       Fixed-time cluster synchronization for complex networks via pinning   control
021       In this paper, the fixed-time cluster synchronization problem for complex networks via pinning control is discussed. 
020       Fixed-time synchronization has been a hot topic in recent years, which means that the network can achieve synchronization in finite-time and the settling time is bounded by a constant for any initial values. To realize the fixed-time cluster synchronization, a simple distributed protocol by pinning control technique is designed, whose validity is rigorously proved, and some sufficient criteria for fixed-time cluster synchronization are also obtained. Especially, when the cluster number is one, the cluster synchronization becomes the complete synchronization problem; when the intrinsic dynamics for each node is missed, the fixed-time cluster synchronization becomes the fixed-time cluster (or complete) consensus problem; when the network has only one node, the coupling term between nodes will disappear, and the synchronization problem becomes the simplest master-slave case, which also includes the stability problem for nonlinear systems like neural networks. All these cases are also discussed. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the correctness of obtained theoretical results.

010       Pore space analysis of beech wood: the vessel network
021       Water transport in wood is vital for the survival of trees. 
020       With synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM), it becomes possible to characterize and quantify the 3D network formed by vessels that are responsible for longitudinal transport. In the present paper, the spatial size dependence of vessels and the organization inside single growth rings in terms of vessel induced porosity was studied by SRXTM. Network characteristics, such as connectivity, were deduced by digital image analysis from the processed tomographic data and related to known complex network topologies.

010       A complex network theory approach for the spatial distribution of fire   breaks in heterogeneous forest landscapes for the control of wildland fires
021       Based on complex network theory, we propose a computational methodology that addresses the spatial distribution of fuel breaks for the inhibition of the spread and size of wildland fires on heterogeneous landscapes. 
020       This is a two-tire approach where the dynamics of fire spread are modeled as a random Markov field process on a directed network whose edge weights, are provided by a state-of-the-art cellular automata model that integrates detailed GIS, landscape and meteorological data. Within this framework, the spatial distribution of fuel breaks is reduced to the problem of finding the network nodes among which the fire spreads faster, thus their removal favours the inhibition of the fire propagation. Here this is accomplished exploiting the information centrality statistics. We illustrate the proposed approach through (a) an artificial forest of randomly distributed density of vegetation, and (b) a real-world case concerning the island of Rhodes in Greece whose a major part of its forest burned in 2008. Simulation results show that the methodology outperforms significantly the benchmark tactic of random distribution of fuel breaks.

010       On the Role of Network Centrality in the Controllability of Complex   Networks
021       In recent years complex networks have gained increasing attention in different fields of science and engineering. 
020       The problem of controlling these networks is an interesting and challenging problem to investigate. In this paper we look at the controllability problem focusing on the energy needed for the control. Precisely not only we want to analyze whether a network can be controlled, but we also want to establish whether the control can be performed using a limited amount of energy. We restrict our study to irreducible and (marginally) stable networks and we find that the leading right and left eigenvectors of the network matrix play a crucial role in this analysis. Interestingly, our results suggest the existence of a connection between controllability and network centrality, a well-known concept in network science. In case the network is reversible, the latter connection involves the PageRank, an extensively studied type of centrality measure. Finally, the proposed results are applied to examples concerning random graphs.

010       Can recurrence networks show small world property?
021       Recurrence networks are complex networks, constructed from time series data, having several practical applications. 
020       Though their properties when constructed with the threshold value \epsilon chosen at or just above the percolation threshold of the network are quite well understood, what happens as the threshold increases beyond the usual operational window is still not clear from a complex network perspective. The present Letter is focused mainly on the network properties at intermediate-to-large values of the recurrence threshold, for which no systematic study has been performed so far. We argue, with numerical support, that recurrence networks constructed from chaotic attractors with \epsilon equal to the usual recurrence threshold or slightly above cannot, in general, show small-world property. However, if the threshold is further increased, the recurrence network topology initially changes to a small-worldstructure and finally to that of a classical random graph as the threshold approaches the size of the strange attractor.

010       Information transfer in community structured multiplex networks
021       The study of complex networks that account for different types of interactions has become a subject of interest in the last few years, specially because its representational power in the description of users interactions in diverse online social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). 
020       The mathematical description of these interacting networks has been coined under the name of multilayer networks, where each layer accounts for a type of interaction. It has been shown that diffusive processes on top of these networks present a phenomenology that cannot be explained by the naive superposition of single layer diffusive phenomena but require the whole structure of interconnected layers. Nevertheless, the description of diffusive phenomena on multilayer networks has obviated the fact that social networks have strong mesoscopic structure represented by different communities of individuals driven by common interests, or any other social aspect. In this work, we study the transfer of information in multilayer networks with community structure. The final goal is to understand and quantify, if the existence of well-defined community structure at the level of individual layers, together with the multilayer structure of the whole network, enhances or deteriorates the diffusion of packets of information.

010       Self-organization of network dynamics into local quantized states
021       Self-organization and pattern formation in network-organized systems emerges from the collective activation and interaction of many interconnected units. 
020       A striking feature of these non-equilibrium structures is that they are often localized and robust: only a small subset of the nodes, or cell assembly, is activated. Understanding the role of cell assemblies as basic functional units in neural networks and socio-technical systems emerges as a fundamental challenge in network theory. A key open question is how these elementary building blocks emerge, and how they operate, linking structure and function in complex networks. Here we show that a network analogue of the Swift-Hohenberg continuum model---a minimal-ingredients model of nodal activation and interaction within a complex network---is able to produce a complex suite of localized patterns. Hence, the spontaneous formation of robust operational cell assemblies in complex networks can be explained as the result of self-organization, even in the absence of synaptic reinforcements. Our results show that these self-organized, local structures can provide robust functional units to understand natural and socio-technical network-organized processes.

010       Control and controllability of nonlinear dynamical networks: a   geometrical approach
021       In spite of the recent interest and advances in linear controllability of complex networks, controlling nonlinear network dynamics remains to be an outstanding problem. 
020       We develop an experimentally feasible control framework for nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability (multiple coexisting final states or attractors), which are representative of, e.g., gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The control objective is to apply parameter perturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that the former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework practically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing the following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b) it is applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK, in which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a directional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from the former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of the attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for nonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying attractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We demonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of experimental GRNs. A finding is that, due to nonlinearity, noise can counter-intuitively facilitate control of the network dynamics.

010       Graphic Realizations of Joint-Degree Matrices
021       In this paper we introduce extensions and modifications of the classical degree sequence graphic realization problem studied by Erd\H{o}s-Gallai and Havel-Hakimi, as well as of the corresponding connected graphic realization version. 
020       We define the joint-degree matrix graphic (resp. connected graphic) realization problem, where in addition to the degree sequence, the exact number of desired edges between vertices of different degree classes is also specified. We give necessary and sufficient conditions, and polynomial time decision and construction algorithms for the graphic and connected graphic realization problems. These problems arise naturally in the current topic of graph modeling for complex networks. From the technical point of view, the joint-degree matrix realization algorithm is straightforward. However, the connected joint-degree matrix realization algorithm involves a novel recursive search of suitable local graph modifications. Also, we outline directions for further work of both theoretical and practical interest. In particular, we give a Markov chain which converges to the uniform distribution over all realizations. We show that the underline state space is connected, and we leave the question of the mixing rate open.

010       Role of dimensionality in complex networks: Connection with nonextensive   statistics
021       Deep connections are known to exist between scale-free networks and non-Gibbsian statistics. 
020       For example, typical degree distributions at the thermodynamical limit are of the form $P(k) \propto e_q^{-k/\kappa}$, where the $q$-exponential form $e_q^z \equiv [1+(1-q)z]^{\frac{1}{1-q}}$ optimizes the nonadditive entropy $S_q$ (which, for $q\to 1$, recovers the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy). We introduce and study here $d$-dimensional geographically-located networks which grow with preferential attachment involving Euclidean distances through $r_{ij}^{-\alpha_A} \; (\alpha_A \ge 0)$. Revealing the connection with $q$-statistics, we numerically verify (for $d$ =1, 2, 3 and 4) that the $q$-exponential degree distributions exhibit, for both $q$ and $\kappa$, universal dependences on the ratio $\alpha_A/d$. Moreover, the $q=1$ limit is rapidly achieved by increasing $\alpha_A/d$ to infinity.

010       One node driving synchronisation
021       Abrupt changes of behaviour in complex networks can be triggered by a single node. 
020       This work describes the dynamical fundamentals of how the behaviour of one node affects the whole network formed by coupled phase-oscillators with heterogeneous coupling strengths. The synchronisation of phase-oscillators is independent of the distribution of the natural frequencies, weakly depends on the network size, but highly depends on only one key oscillator whose ratio between its natural frequency in a rotating frame and its coupling strength is maximum. This result is based on a novel method to calculate the critical coupling strength with which the phase-oscillators emerge into frequency synchronisation. In addition, we put forward an analytical method to approximately calculate the phase-angles for the synchronous oscillators.

010       Moss: A Scalable Tool for Efficiently Sampling and Counting 4- and   5-Node Graphlets
021       Counting the frequencies of 3-, 4-, and 5-node undirected motifs (also know as graphlets) is widely used for understanding complex networks such as social and biology networks. 
020       However, it is a great challenge to compute these metrics for a large graph due to the intensive computation. Despite recent efforts to count triangles (i.e., 3-node undirected motif counting), little attention has been given to developing scalable tools that can be used to characterize 4- and 5-node motifs. In this paper, we develop computational efficient methods to sample and count 4- and 5- node undirected motifs. Our methods provide unbiased estimators of motif frequencies, and we derive simple and exact formulas for the variances of the estimators. Moreover, our methods are designed to fit vertex centric programming models, so they can be easily applied to current graph computing systems such as Pregel and GraphLab. We conduct experiments on a variety of real-word datasets, and experimental results show that our methods are several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods under the same estimation errors.

010       Atypical scaling behavior persists in real world interaction networks
021       Scale-free power law structure describes complex networks derived from a wide range of real world processes. 
020       The extensive literature focuses almost exclusively on networks with power law exponent strictly larger than 2, which can be explained by constant vertex growth and preferential attachment. The complementary scale-free behavior in the range between 1 and 2 has been mostly neglected as atypical because there is no known generating mechanism to explain how networks with this property form. However, empirical observations reveal that scaling in this range is an inherent feature of real world networks obtained from repeated interactions within a population, as in social, communication, and collaboration networks. A generative model explains the observed phenomenon through the realistic dynamics of constant edge growth and a positive feedback mechanism. Our investigation, therefore, yields a novel empirical observation grounded in a strong theoretical basis for its occurrence.

010       Control of complex networks requires both structure and dynamics
021       The study of network structure has uncovered signatures of the organization of complex systems. 
020       However, there is also a need to understand how to control them; for example, identifying strategies to revert a diseased cell to a healthy state, or a mature cell to a pluripotent state. Two recent methodologies suggest that the controllability of complex systems can be predicted solely from the graph of interactions between variables, without considering their dynamics: structural controllability and minimum dominating sets. We demonstrate that such structure-only methods fail to characterize controllability when dynamics are introduced. We study Boolean network ensembles of network motifs as well as three models of biochemical regulation: the segment polarity network in Drosophila melanogaster, the cell cycle of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the floral organ arrangement in Arabidopsis thaliana. We demonstrate that structure-only methods both undershoot and overshoot the number and which sets of critical variables best control the dynamics of these models, highlighting the importance of the actual system dynamics in determining control. Our analysis further shows that the logic of automata transition functions, namely how canalizing they are, plays an important role in the extent to which structure predicts dynamics.

010       A City Is a Complex Network
021       A city is not a tree but a semi-lattice. 
020       To use a perhaps more familiar term, a city is a complex network. The complex network constitutes a unique topological perspective on cities and enables us to better understand the kind of problem a city is. The topological perspective differentiates it from the perspectives of Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics that deal with essentially regular shapes and more or less similar things. Many urban theories, such as the Central Place Theory, Zipf's Law, the Image of the City, and the Theory of Centers can be interpreted from the point of view of complex networks. A livable city consists of far more small things than large ones, and their shapes tend to be irregular and rough. This chapter illustrates the complex network view and argues that we must abandon the kind of thinking (mis-)guided by Euclidean geometry and Gaussian statistics, and instead adopt fractal geometry, power-law statistics, and Alexander's living geometry to develop sustainable cities. <br />Keywords: Scaling, living structure, theory of centers, objective beauty, head/tail breaks

010       Self-Coordinated Corona Graphs: a model for complex networks
021       Recently, real world networks having constant/shrinking diameter along with power-law degree distribution are observed and investigated in literature. 
020       Taking an inspiration from these findings, we propose a deterministic complex network model, which we call Self-Coordinated Corona Graphs (SCCG), based on the corona product of graphs. As it has also been established that self coordination/organization of nodes gives rise to emergence of power law in degree distributions of several real networks, the networks in the proposed model are generated by the virtue of self coordination of nodes in corona graphs. Alike real networks, the SCCG inherit motifs which act as the seed graphs for the generation of SCCG. We also analytically prove that the power law exponent of SCCG is approximately $2$ and the diameter of SCCG produced by a class of motifs is constant. Finally, we compare different properties of the proposed model with that of the BA and Pseudofractal scale-free models for complex networks.

010       Balance of interactions determines optimal survival in multi-species   communities
021       We consider a multi-species community modelled as a complex network of populations, where the links are given by a random asymmetric matrix J, with fraction 1-C of zero entries, where C reflects the over-all connectivity of the system. 
020       The non-zero elements of J are drawn from a gaussian distribution with mean 'mu' and standard deviation . The signs of the elements J reflect the nature of density-dependent interactions, such as predatory-prey, mutualism or competition, and their magnitudes reflect the strength of the interaction. In this study we try to uncover the broad features of the interspecies interactions that determine the global robustness of this network, as indicated by the average number of active nodes (i.e. non-extinct species) in the network, and the total population, reflecting the biomass yield. We find that the network transitions from a completely extinct system to one where all nodes are active, as the mean interaction strength goes from negative to positive. We also find that the total population, displays distinct non-monotonic scaling behaviour with respect to the product 'mu'C, implying that survival is dependent not merely on the number of links, but rather on the combination of the sparseness of the connectivity matrix and the net interaction strength. Moreover, the total population levels are optimal when the network has intermediate net positive connection strengths. At the local level we observe marked qualitative changes in dynamical patterns, ranging from anti-phase clusters of period 2 cycles and chaotic bands, to fixed points, under the variation of mean 'mu' of the interaction strengths. Lastly, we propose an effective low dimensional map to capture the behavior of the entire network, and this provides a broad understanding of the interplay of the local dynamical patterns and the global robustness trends in the network.

010       Spatial network surrogates for disentangling complex system structure   from spatial embedding of nodes
021       Networks with nodes embedded in a metric space have gained increasing interest in recent years. 
020       The effects of spatial embedding on the networks' structural characteristics, however, are rarely taken into account when studying their macroscopic properties. Here, we propose a hierarchy of null models to generate random surrogates from a given spatially embedded network that can preserve global and local statistics associated with the nodes' embedding in a metric space. Comparing the original network's and the resulting surrogates' global characteristics allows to quantify to what extent these characteristics are already predetermined by the spatial embedding of the nodes and links. We apply our framework to various real-world spatial networks and show that the proposed models capture macroscopic properties of the networks under study much better than standard random network models that do not account for the nodes' spatial embedding. Depending on the actual performance of the proposed null models, the networks are categorized into different classes. Since many real-world complex networks are in fact spatial networks, the proposed approach is relevant for disentangling underlying complex system structure from spatial embedding of nodes in many fields, ranging from social systems over infrastructure and neurophysiology to climatology.

010       Chimera-like states in modular neural networks
021       Chimera states, namely the coexistence of coherent and incoherent behavior, were previously analyzed in complex networks. 
020       However, they have not been extensively studied in modular networks. Here, we consider the neural network of the \textit{C.elegans} soil worm, organized into six interconnected communities, where neurons obey chaotic bursting dynamics. Neurons are assumed to be connected with electrical synapses within their communities and with chemical synapses across them. As our numerical simulations reveal, the coaction of these two types of coupling can shape the dynamics in such a way that chimera-like states can happen. They consist of a fraction of synchronized neurons which belong to the larger communities, and a fraction of desynchronized neurons which are part of smaller communities. In addition to the Kuramoto order parameter $\rho$, we also employ other measures of coherence, such as the chimera-like $\chi$ and metastability $\lambda$ indices, which quantify the degree of synchronization among communities and along time, respectively. We perform the same analysis for networks that share common features with the \textit{C.elegans} neural network. Similar results suggest that under certain assumptions, chimera-like states are prominent phenomena in modular networks, and might provide insight for the behavior of more complex modular networks.

010       A Complex Network Approach for Collaborative Recommendation
021       Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most widely used and successful approach for personalized service recommendations. 
020       Among the collaborative recommendation approaches, neighborhood based approaches enjoy a huge amount of popularity, due to their simplicity, justifiability, efficiency and stability. Neighborhood based collaborative filtering approach finds K nearest neighbors to an active user or K most similar rated items to the target item for recommendation. Traditional similarity measures use ratings of co-rated items to find similarity between a pair of users. Therefore, traditional similarity measures cannot compute effective neighbors in sparse dataset. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach, which generates user-user and item-item networks using traditional similarity measures in the first phase. In the second phase, two hybrid approaches HB1, HB2, which utilize structural similarity of both the network for finding K nearest neighbors and K most similar items to a target items are introduced. To show effectiveness of the measures, we compared performances of neighborhood based CFs using state-of-the-art similarity measures with our proposed structural similarity measures based CFs. Recommendation results on a set of real data show that proposed measures based CFs outperform existing measures based CFs in various evaluation metrics.

010       Bayesian modeling of networks in complex business intelligence problems
021       Complex network data problems are increasingly common in many fields of application. 
020       Our motivation is drawn from strategic marketing studies monitoring customer choices of specific products, along with co-subscription networks encoding multiple purchasing behavior. Data are available for several agencies within the same insurance company, and our goal is to efficiently exploit co-subscription networks to inform targeted advertising of cross-sell strategies to currently mono-product customers. We address this goal by developing a Bayesian hierarchical model, which clusters agencies according to common mono-product customer choices and co-subscription networks. Within each cluster, we efficiently model customer behavior via a cluster-dependent mixture of latent eigenmodels. This formulation provides key information on mono-product customer choices and multiple purchasing behavior within each cluster, informing targeted cross-sell strategies. We develop simple algorithms for tractable inference, and assess performance in simulations and an application to business intelligence.

010       Monitoring Potential Drug Interactions and Reactions via Network   Analysis of Instagram User Timelines
021       Much recent research aims to identify evidence for Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) and Adverse Drug reactions (ADR) from the biomedical scientific literature. 
020       In addition to this "Bibliome", the universe of social media provides a very promising source of large-scale data that can help identify DDI and ADR in ways that have not been hitherto possible. Given the large number of users, analysis of social media data may be useful to identify under-reported, population-level pathology associated with DDI, thus further contributing to improvements in population health. Moreover, tapping into this data allows us to infer drug interactions with natural products--including cannabis--which constitute an array of DDI very poorly explored by biomedical research thus far. Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology at large. Using drug, symptom, and natural product dictionaries for identification of the various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we have collected ~7000 timelines. We report on 1) the development of a monitoring tool to easily observe user-level timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, and 2) population-level behavior via the analysis of co-occurrence networks computed from user timelines at three different scales: monthly, weekly, and daily occurrences. Analysis of these networks further reveals 3) drug and symptom direct and indirect associations with greater support in user timelines, as well as 4) clusters of symptoms and drugs revealed by the collective behavior of the observed population. This demonstrates that Instagram contains much drug- and pathology specific data for public health monitoring of DDI and ADR, and that complex network analysis provides an important toolbox to extract health-related associations and their support from large-scale social media data.

010       Centrality metrics and localization in core-periphery networks
021       Two concepts of centrality have been defined in complex networks. 
020       The first considers the centrality of a node and many different metrics for it has been defined (e.g. eigenvector centrality, PageRank, non-backtracking centrality, etc). The second is related to a large scale organization of the network, the core-periphery structure, composed by a dense core plus an outlying and loosely-connected periphery. In this paper we investigate the relation between these two concepts. We consider networks generated via the Stochastic Block Model, or its degree corrected version, with a strong core-periphery structure and we investigate the centrality properties of the core nodes and the ability of several centrality metrics to identify them. We find that the three measures with the best performance are marginals obtained with belief propagation, PageRank, and degree centrality, while non-backtracking and eigenvector centrality (or MINRES}, showed to be equivalent to the latter in the large network limit) perform worse in the investigated networks.

010       Controllability Metrics on Networks with Linear Decision Process-type   Interactions and Multiplicative Noise
021       This paper aims at the study of controllability properties and induced controllability metrics on complex networks governed by a class of (discrete time) linear decision processes with mul-tiplicative noise. 
020       The dynamics are given by a couple consisting of a Markov trend and a linear decision process for which both the "deterministic" and the noise components rely on trend-dependent matrices. We discuss approximate, approximate null and exact null-controllability. Several examples are given to illustrate the links between these concepts and to compare our results with their continuous-time counterpart (given in [16]). We introduce a class of backward stochastic Riccati difference schemes (BSRDS) and study their solvability for particular frameworks. These BSRDS allow one to introduce Gramian-like controllability metrics. As application of these metrics, we propose a minimal intervention-targeted reduction in the study of gene networks.

010       Dynamic information routing in complex networks
021       Flexible information routing fundamentally underlies the function of many biological and artificial networks. 
020       Yet, how such systems may specifically communicate and dynamically route information is not well understood. Here we identify a generic mechanism to route information on top of collective dynamical reference states in complex networks. Switching between collective dynamics induces flexible reorganization of information sharing and routing patterns, as quantified by delayed mutual information and transfer entropy measures between activities of a network's units. We demonstrate the power of this generic mechanism specifically for oscillatory dynamics and analyze how individual unit properties, the network topology and external inputs coact to systematically organize information routing. For multi-scale, modular architectures, we resolve routing patterns at all levels. Interestingly, local interventions within one sub-network may remotely determine non-local network-wide communication. These results help understanding and designing information routing patterns across systems where collective dynamics co-occurs with a communication function.

010       Chaotic, informational and synchronous behaviour of multiplex networks
021       The understanding of the relationship between topology and behaviour in interconnected networks would allow to characterise and predict behaviour in many real complex networks since both are usually not simultaneously known. 
020       Most previous studies have focused on the relationship between topology and synchronisation. In this work, we provide analytical formulas that shows how topology drives complex behaviour: chaos, information, and weak or strong synchronisation; in multiplex networks with constant Jacobian. We also study this relationship numerically in multiplex networks of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. Whereas behaviour in the analytically tractable network is a direct but not trivial consequence of the spectra of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, where behaviour may strongly depend on the break of symmetry in the topology of interconnections, in Hindmarsh-Rose neural networks the nonlinear nature of the chemical synapses breaks the elegant mathematical connection between the spectra of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix and the behaviour of the network, creating networks whose behaviour strongly depends on the nature (chemical or electrical) of the inter synapses.

010       On the shadow moments of apparently infinite-mean phenomena
021       We propose an approach to compute the conditional moments of fat-tailed phenomena that, only looking at data, could be mistakenly considered as having infinite mean. 
020       This type of problems manifests itself when a random variable Y has a heavy- tailed distribution with an extremely wide yet bounded support. We introduce the concept of dual distribution, by means of a log-transformation that removes the upper bound. The tail of the dual distribution can then be studied using extreme value theory, without making excessive parametric assumptions, and the estimates one obtains can be used to study the original distribution and compute its moments by reverting the log- transformation. The central difference between our approach and a simple truncation is in the smoothness of the transformation between the original and the dual distribution, allowing use of extreme value theory. War casualties, operational risk, environment blight, complex networks and many other econophysics phenomena are possible fields of application.

010       Persistent topological features of dynamical systems
021       A general method for constructing simplicial complex from observed time series of dynamical systems based on the delay coordinate reconstruction procedure is presented. 
020       The obtained simplicial complex preserves all pertinent topological features of the reconstructed phase space and it may be analyzes from topological, combinatorial and algebraic aspects. In focus of this study is the computation of homology of the invariant set of some well known dynamical systems which display chaotic behavior. Persistent homology of simplicial complex and its relationship with the embedding dimensions are examined by studying the lifetime of topological features and topological noise. The consistency of topological properties for different dynamic regimes and embedding dimensions is examined. The obtained results shed new light on the topological properties of the reconstructed phase space and open up new possibilities for application of advanced topological methods. the method presented here may be used as a generic method for constructing simplicial complex from a scalar time series which has a number of advantages compared to the mapping of the time series to a complex network.

010       Characterization of river flow fluctuations via horizontal visibility   graphs
021       We report on a large-scale characterization of river discharges by employing the network framework of the horizontal visibility graph. 
020       By mapping daily time series from 141 different stations of 53 Brazilian rivers into complex networks, we present an useful approach for investigating the dynamics of river flows. We verified that the degree distributions of these networks were well described by exponential functions, where the characteristic exponents are almost always larger than the value obtained for random time series. The faster-than-random decay of the degree distributions is an another evidence that the fluctuation dynamics underlying the river discharges has a long-range correlated nature. We further investigated the evolution of the river discharges by tracking the values of the characteristic exponents (of the degree distribution) and the global clustering coefficients of the networks over the years. We show that the river discharges in several stations have evolved to become more or less correlated (and displaying more or less complex internal network structures) over the years, a behavior that could be related to changes in the climate system and other man-made phenomena.

010       Link Prediction with Node Clustering Coefficient
021       Predicting missing links in incomplete complex networks efficiently and accurately is still a challenging problem. 
020       The recently proposed CAR (Cannistrai-Alanis-Ravai) index shows the power of local link/triangle information in improving link-prediction accuracy. With the information of level-2 links, which are links between common-neighbors, most classical similarity indices can be improved. Nevertheless, calculating the number of level-2 links makes CAR index not efficient enough. Inspired by the idea of employing local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index with more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle structure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common neighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good effectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is because that it employs links existing between neighbors of the common-neighbor and these links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this common-neighbor. Ten real-world networks drawn from five various fields are used to test the performance of our method against to classical similarity indices and recently proposed CAR index. Two estimators: precision and AUP, are used to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Generally speaking, our new index only performs competitively with CAR, but it is a good complement to CAR for networks with not very high LCP-corr, which is a measure to estimate the correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of links between common-neighbors. Besides, the proposed index is also more efficient than CAR index.

010       Functional brain modules reconfigure at multiple scales across the human   lifespan
021       The human brain is a complex network of interconnected brain regions organized into functional modules with distinct roles in cognition and behavior. 
020       An important question concerns the persistence and stability of these modules over the human lifespan. Here we use graph-theoretic analysis to algorithmically uncover the brain's intrinsic modular organization across multiple spatial scales ranging from small communities comprised of only a few brain regions to large communities made up of many regions. We find that at coarse scales modules become progressively more segregated, while at finer scales segregation decreases. Module composition also exhibits scale-specific and age-dependent changes. At coarse scales, the module assignments of regions normally associated with control, default mode, attention, and visual networks are highly flexible. At fine scales the most flexible regions are associated with the default mode network. Finally, we show that, with age, some regions in the default mode network, specifically retrosplenial cortex, maintain a greater proportion of functional connections to their own module, while regions associated with somatomotor and saliency/ventral attention networks distribute their links more evenly across modules.

The first model is an agent-based model over Bianconi-Barabasi networks, used to explain the relation between network size, extroversion, and age of individuals. The second model deals with the emergence of urban tribes as a consequence of a smaller propensity to communicate with different with different traits and opinions.

010       Identify influential spreaders in complex networks, the role of   neighborhood
021       Identifying the most influential spreaders is an important issue in controlling the spreading processes in complex networks. 
020       Centrality measures are used to rank node influence in a spreading dynamics. Here we propose a node influence measure based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors' centrality, which we call the neighborhood centrality. By simulating the spreading processes in six real-world networks, we find that the neighborhood centrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the degree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most influential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in considering the neighborhood of a node, which is not the case of the larger the better. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is a good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of neighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and even decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be informative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to determine its importance in the network.

010       Controlling synchronous patterns in complex networks
021       Although the set of permutation symmetries of a complex network can be very large, few of the symmetries give rise to stable synchronous patterns. 
020       Here we present a new framework and develop techniques for controlling synchronization patterns in complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators. Specifically, according to the network permutation symmetry, we design a small-size and weighted network, namely the control network, and use it to control the large-size complex network by means of pinning coupling. We argue mathematically that for \emph{any} of the network symmetries, there always exists a critical pinning strength beyond which the unstable synchronous pattern associated to this symmetry can be stabilized. The feasibility of the control method is verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and real-work networks, and is demonstrated by experiment of coupled chaotic circuits. Our studies pave a way to the control of dynamical patterns in complex networks.

010       Two-dimensional epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures:   A platform for topological superconducting networks
021       Progress in the emergent field of topological superconductivity relies on synthesis of new material combinations, combining superconductivity, low density, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). 
020       For example, theory [1-4] indicates that the interface between a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor (Sm) with strong SOC and a superconductor (S) hosts Majorana modes with nontrivial topological properties [5-8]. Recently, epitaxial growth of Al on InAs nanowires was shown to yield a high quality S-Sm system with uniformly transparent interfaces [9] and a hard induced gap, indicted by strongly suppressed sub gap tunneling conductance [10]. Here we report the realization of a two-dimensional (2D) InAs/InGaAs heterostructure with epitaxial Al, yielding a planar S-Sm system with structural and transport characteristics as good as the epitaxial wires. The realization of 2D epitaxial S-Sm systems represent a significant advance over wires, allowing extended networks via top-down processing. Among numerous potential applications, this new material system can serve as a platform for complex networks of topological superconductors with gate-controlled Majorana zero modes [1-4]. We demonstrate gateable Josephson junctions and a highly transparent 2D S-Sm interface based on the product of excess current and normal state resistance.

010       SGPD Volume Maximization for Community Detection
021       In this note we briefly study the feasibility of community detection in complex networks using peripheral vertices. 
020       Our method suggests a novel direction in axiomizing the problem of clustering in graphs and complex networks by looking at the topological role each vertex plays in the community structure, regardless of the attributes. The promising strength of pseudo-peripheral vertices as a lever for analysis of complex networks is also demonstrated on real-world data.

010       Enhancing speed of pinning synchronizability: low-degree nodes with high   feedback gains
021       Controlling complex networks is of paramount importance in science and engineering. 
020       Despite recent efforts to improve controllability and synchronous strength, little attention has been paid to the speed of pinning synchronizability (rate of convergence in pinning control) and the corresponding pinning node selection. To address this issue, we propose a hypothesis to restrict the control cost, then build a linear matrix inequality related to the speed of pinning controllability. By solving the inequality, we obtain both the speed of pinning controllability and optimal control strength (feedback gains in pinning control) for all nodes. Interestingly, some low-degree nodes are able to achieve large feedback gains, which suggests that they have high influence on controlling system. In addition, when choosing nodes with high feedback gains as pinning nodes, the controlling speed of real systems is remarkably enhanced compared to that of traditional large-degree and large-betweenness selections. Thus, the proposed approach provides a novel way to investigate the speed of pinning controllability and can evoke other effective heuristic pinning node selections for large-scale systems.

010       Control Improvisation with Probabilistic Temporal Specifications
021       We consider the problem of generating randomized control sequences for complex networked systems typically actuated by human agents. 
020       Our approach leverages a concept known as control improvisation, which is based on a combination of data-driven learning and controller synthesis from formal specifications. We learn from existing data a generative model (for instance, an explicit-duration hidden Markov model, or EDHMM) and then supervise this model in order to guarantee that the generated sequences satisfy some desirable specifications given in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL). We present an implementation of our approach and apply it to the problem of mimicking the use of lighting appliances in a residential unit, with potential applications to home security and resource management. We present experimental results showing that our approach produces realistic control sequences, similar to recorded data based on human actuation, while satisfying suitable formal requirements.

010       Community dynamics in connected time-dependent multilayer networks
021       Different strategies have been considered to extract information from social media about how similarly people react to the same news or event. 
020       In this context, a powerful method is offered by the application of graph techniques to the contents produced by social network users. In particular, large events typically attract enough content traffic along time to enable an analysis that explicitly models a dependence from the time dimension. Here we demonstrate how it is possible to extend the application of community detection strategies in complex networks to the case of time-dependent multilayer networks, whenever the connection between consecutive time layers is non-trivial. We apply the method to 400K Twitter post related to the Expo event held in Milan (Italy) between May and October 2015.

010       Conflicting attachment and the growth of bipartite networks
021       Simple growth mechanisms have been proposed to explain the emergence of seemingly universal network structures. 
020       The widely-studied model of preferential attachment assumes that new nodes are more likely to connect to highly connected nodes. Preferential attachment explains the emergence of scale-free degree distributions within complex networks. Yet, it is incompatible with many network systems, particularly bipartite systems in which two distinct types of agents interact. For example, the addition of new links in a host-parasite system corresponds to the infection of hosts by parasites. Increasing connectivity is beneficial to a parasite and detrimental to a host. Therefore, the overall network connectivity is subject to conflicting pressures. Here, we propose a stochastic network growth model of conflicting attachment, inspired by a particular kind of parasite-host interactions: that of viruses interacting with microbial hosts. The mechanism of network growth includes conflicting preferences to network density as well as costs involved in modifying the network connectivity according to these preferences. We find that the resulting networks exhibit realistic patterns commonly observed in empirical data, including the emergence of nestedness, modularity, and nested-modular structures that exhibit both properties. We study the role of conflicting interests in shaping network structure and assess opportunities to incorporate greater realism in linking growth process to pattern in systems governed by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.

010       Network geometry with flavor: from complexity to quantum geometry
021       Here we introduce the Network Geometry with Flavor $s=-1,0,1$ (NGF) describing simplicial complexes defined in arbitrary dimension $d$ and evolving by a non-equilibrium dynamics. 
020       The NGF can generate discrete geometries of different nature, ranging from chains and higher dimensional manifolds to scale-free networks with small-world properties, scale-free degree distribution and non-trivial community structure. The NGF admits as limiting cases both the Bianconi-Barab\'asi model for complex networks the stochastic Apollonian network, and the recently introduced model for Complex Quantum Network Manifolds. The thermodynamic properties of NGF reveal that NGF obeys a generalized area law opening a new scenario for formulating its coarse-grained limit. The structure of NGF is strongly dependent on the dimensionality $d$. We also show that NGF admits a quantum mechanical description in terms of associated quantum network states. Quantum network states are evolving by a Markovian dynamics and a quantum network state at time $t$ encodes all possible NGF evolutions up to time $t$. Interestingly the NGF remains fully classical but its statistical properties reveal the relation to its quantum mechanical description. In fact the $\delta$-dimensional faces of the NGF have generalized degrees that follow either the Fermi-Dirac, Boltzmann or Bose-Einstein statistics depending on the flavor $s$ and the dimensions $d$ and $\delta$.

021       Predicting the future evolution of complex systems is one of the main challenges in complexity science. 
020       Based on a current snapshot of a network, link prediction algorithms aim to predict its future evolution. We apply here link prediction algorithms to data on the international trade between countries. This data can be represented as a complex network where links connect countries with the products that they export. Link prediction techniques based on heat and mass diffusion processes are employed to obtain predictions for products exported in the future. These baseline predictions are improved using a recent metric of country fitness and product similarity. The overall best results are achieved with a newly developed metric of product similarity which takes advantage of causality in the network evolution.

020       The size of the real world complex networks, such as online social networks, WWW networks, collaboration networks, is exponentially increasing with time. It is not feasible to completely collect, store and process these networks. In the present work, we propose a method to estimate the degree centrality ranking of a node without having complete structure of the graph. The proposed algorithm uses degree of a node and power law exponent of the degree distribution to calculate the ranking. We also study simulation results on Barabasi-Albert model. Simulation results show that the average error in the estimated ranking is approximately $5\%$ of the total number of nodes.

We measured distributions of papers in different scientific fields, their growth rates and properties of co-authorship networks. {The elements of descriptive statistics and the tools of the complex network theory are used to highlight the interdisciplinary as well as international effects.} Our analysis allows to compare contributions of the international community to Chornobyl-related research as well as integration of Ukraine in the international research on this subject. Furthermore, the content analysis of titles and abstracts of the publications allowed to detect the most important terms used for description of Chornobyl-related problems.

010       Fundamental building blocks of controlling complex networks: A universal   controllability framework
021       To understand the controllability of complex networks is a forefront problem relevant to different fields of science and engineering. 
020       Despite recent advances in network controllability theories, an outstanding issue is to understand the effect of network topology and nodal interactions on the controllability at the most fundamental level. Here we develop a universal framework based on local information only to unearth the most {\em fundamental building blocks} that determine the controllability. In particular, we introduce a network dissection process to fully unveil the origin of the role of individual nodes and links in control, giving rise to a criterion for the much needed strong structural controllability. We theoretically uncover various phase-transition phenomena associated with the role of nodes and links and strong structural controllability. Applying our theory to a large number of empirical networks demonstrates that technological networks are more strongly structurally controllable (SSC) than many social and biological networks, and real world networks are generally much more SSC than their random counterparts with intrinsic resilience and adaptability as a result of human design and natural evolution.

010       Cover times of random searches
021       How long does it take a random searcher to visit all sites of a given domain? This time, known as the cover time, is a key observable to quantify the efficiency of exhaustive searches, which require a complete exploration of an area and not only the discovery of a single target; examples range from immune system cells chasing pathogens to animals harvesting resources, robotized exploration by e.g. 
020       automated cleaners or deminers, or algorithmics. Despite its broad relevance, the cover time has remained elusive and so far explicit results have been scarce and mostly limited to regular random walks. Here we determine the full distribution of the cover time for a broad range of random search processes, which includes the prominent examples of L\'evy strategies, intermittent strategies, persistent random walks and random walks on complex networks, and reveal its universal features. We show that for all these examples the mean cover time can be minimized, and that the corresponding optimal strategies also minimize the mean search time for a single target, unambiguously pointing towards their robustness.

010       Resiliency of Deep Neural Networks under Quantization
021       The complexity of deep neural network algorithms for hardware implementation can be much lowered by optimizing the word-length of weights and signals. 
020       Direct quantization of floating-point weights, however, does not show good performance when the number of bits assigned is small. Retraining of quantized networks has been developed to relieve this problem. In this work, the effects of retraining are analyzed for a feedforward deep neural network (FFDNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The network complexity is controlled to know their effects on the resiliency of quantized networks by retraining. The complexity of the FFDNN is controlled by varying the unit size in each hidden layer and the number of layers, while that of the CNN is done by modifying the feature map configuration. We find that the performance gap between the floating-point and the retrain-based ternary (+1, 0, -1) weight neural networks exists with a fair amount in 'complexity limited' networks, but the discrepancy almost vanishes in fully complex networks whose capability is limited by the training data, rather than by the number of connections. This research shows that highly complex DNNs have the capability of absorbing the effects of severe weight quantization through retraining, but connection limited networks are less resilient. This paper also presents the effective compression ratio to guide the trade-off between the network size and the precision when the hardware resource is limited.

010       Simple and efficient self-healing strategy for damaged complex networks
021       The process of destroying a complex network through node removal has been the subject of extensive interest and research. 
020       Node loss typically leaves the network disintegrated into many small and isolated clusters. Here we show that these clusters typically remain close to each other and we suggest a simple algorithm that is able to reverse the inflicted damage by restoring the network's functionality. After damage, each node decides independently whether to create a new link depending on the fraction of neighbors it has lost. In addition to relying only on local information, where nodes do not need knowledge of the global network status, we impose the additional constraint that new links should be as short as possible (i.e. that the new edge completes a shortest possible new cycle). We demonstrate that this self-healing method operates very efficiently, both in model and real networks. For example, after removing the most connected airports in USA, the self-healing algorithm re-joined almost 90\% of the surviving airports.

010       A universal data based method for reconstructing complex networks with   binary-state dynamics
021       To understand, predict, and control complex networked systems, a prerequisite is to reconstruct the network structure from observable data. 
020       Despite recent progress in network reconstruction, binary-state dynamics that are ubiquitous in nature, technology and society still present an outstanding challenge in this field. Here we offer a framework for reconstructing complex networks with binary-state dynamics by developing a universal data-based linearization approach that is applicable to systems with linear, nonlinear, discontinuous, or stochastic dynamics governed by monotonous functions. The linearization procedure enables us to convert the network reconstruction into a sparse signal reconstruction problem that can be resolved through convex optimization. We demonstrate generally high reconstruction accuracy for a number of complex networks associated with distinct binary-state dynamics from using binary data contaminated by noise and missing data. Our framework is completely data driven, efficient and robust, and does not require any a priori knowledge about the detailed dynamical process on the network. The framework represents a general paradigm for reconstructing, understanding, and exploiting complex networked systems with binary-state dynamics.

010       The Kuramoto model in complex networks
021       Synchronization of an ensemble of oscillators is an emergent phenomenon present in several complex systems, ranging from social and physical to biological and technological systems. 
020       The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.

010       Nearest Neighbor search in Complex Network for Community Detection
021       Nearest neighbor search is a basic computational tool used extensively in almost research domains of computer science specially when dealing with large amount of data. 
020       However, the use of nearest neighbor search is restricted for the purpose of algorithmic development by the existence of the notion of nearness among the data points. The recent trend of research is on large, complex networks and their structural analysis, where nodes represent entities and edges represent any kind of relation between entities. Community detection in complex network is an important problem of much interest. In general, a community detection algorithm represents an objective function and captures the communities by optimizing it to extract the interesting communities for the user. In this article, we have studied the nearest neighbor search problem in complex network via the development of a suitable notion of nearness. Initially, we have studied and analyzed the exact nearest neighbor search using metric tree on proposed metric space constructed from complex network. After, the approximate nearest neighbor search problem is studied using locality sensitive hashing. For evaluation of the proposed nearest neighbor search on complex network we applied it in community detection problem. The results obtained using our methods are very competitive with most of the well known algorithms exists in the literature and this is verified on collection of real networks. On the other-hand, it can be observed that time taken by our algorithm is quite less compared to popular methods.

010       Multifractal analysis of weighted networks by a modified sandbox   algorithm
021       Complex networks have attracted growing attention in many fields. 
020       As a generalization of fractal analysis, multifractal analysis (MFA) is a useful way to systematically describe the spatial heterogeneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns. Some algorithms for MFA of unweighted complex networks have been proposed in the past a few years, including the sandbox (SB) algorithm recently employed by our group. In this paper, a modified SB algorithm (we call it SBw algorithm) is proposed for MFA of weighted networks.First, we use the SBw algorithm to study the multifractal property of two families of weighted fractal networks (WFNs): "Sierpinski" WFNs and "Cantor dust" WFNs. We also discuss how the fractal dimension and generalized fractal dimensions change with the edge-weights of the WFN. From the comparison between the theoretical and numerical fractal dimensions of these networks, we can find that the proposed SBw algorithm is efficient and feasible for MFA of weighted networks. Then, we apply the SBw algorithm to study multifractal properties of some real weighted networks ---collaboration networks. It is found that the multifractality exists in these weighted networks, and is affected by their edge-weights.

010       Evolving Models for Meso-Scale Structures
021       Real world complex networks are scale free and possess meso-scale properties like core-periphery and community structure. 
020       We study evolution of the core over time in real world networks. This paper proposes evolving models for both unweighted and weighted scale free networks having local and global core-periphery as well as community structure. Network evolves using topological growth, self growth, and weight distribution function. To validate the correctness of proposed models, we use K-shell and S-shell decomposition methods. Simulation results show that the generated unweighted networks follow power law degree distribution with droop head and heavy tail. Similarly, generated weighted networks follow degree, strength, and edge-weight power law distributions. We further study other properties of complex networks, such as clustering coefficient, nearest neighbor degree, and strength degree correlation.

010       Rank me thou shalln&#x27;t Compare me
021       Centrality measures have been defined to quantify the importance of a node in complex networks. 
020       The relative importance of a node can be measured using its centrality rank based on the centrality value. In the present work, we predict the degree centrality rank of a node without having the entire network. The proposed method uses degree of the node and some network parameters to predict its rank. These network parameters include network size, minimum, maximum, and average degree of the network. These parameters are estimated using random walk sampling techniques. The proposed method is validated on Barabasi-Albert networks. Simulation results show that the proposed method predicts the rank of higher degree nodes with more accuracy. The average error in the rank prediction is approximately $0.16\%$ of the network size.

010       Can topology reshape segregation patterns?
021       We consider a metapopulation version of the Schelling model of segregation over several complex networks and lattice. 
020       We show that the segregation process is topology independent and hence it is intrinsic to the individual tolerance. The role of the topology is to fix the places where the segregation patterns emerge. In addition we address the question of the time evolution of the segregation clusters, resulting from different dynamical regimes of a coarsening process, as a function of the tolerance parameter. We show that the underlying topology may alter the early stage of the coarsening process, once large values of the tolerance are used, while for lower ones a different mechanism is at work and it results to be topology independent.

010       A biologically constrained model of the whole basal ganglia addressing   the paradoxes of connections and selection
021       The basal ganglia nuclei form a complex network of nuclei often assumed to perform selection, yet their individual roles and how they influence each other is still largely unclear. 
020       In particular, the ties between the external and internal parts of the globus pallidus are paradoxical, as anatomical data suggest a potent inhibitory projection between them while electrophys-iological recordings indicate that they have similar activities. Here we introduce a theoretical study that reconciles both views on the intra-pallidal projection, by providing a plausible characterization of the relationship between the external and internal globus pallidus. Specifically, we developed a mean-field model of the whole basal ganglia, whose parameterization is optimized to respect best a collection of numerous anatomical and electrophysiological data. We first obtained models respecting all our constraints, hence anatomical and electrophysiological data on the intrapallidal projection are globally consistent. This model furthermore predicts that both aforementioned views about the intra-pallidal projection may be reconciled when this projection is weakly inhibitory, thus making it possible to support similar neural activity in both nuclei and for the entire basal ganglia to select between actions. Second, we predicts that afferent projections are substantially unbalanced towards the external segment, as it receives the strongest excitation from STN and the weakest inhibition from the striatum. Finally, our study strongly suggest that the intrapallidal connection pattern is not focused but diffuse, as this latter pattern is more efficient for the overall selection performed in the basal ganglia.

010       Fluid leakage near the percolation threshold
021       Percolation is a concept widely used in many fields of research and refers to the propagation of substances through porous media (e.g., coffee filtering), or the behaviour of complex networks (e.g., spreading of diseases). 
020       Percolation theory asserts that most percolative processes are universal, that is, the emergent powerlaws only depend on the general, statistical features of the macroscopic system, but not on specific details of the random realisation. In contrast, our computer simulations of the leakage through a seal---applying common assumptions of elasticity, contact mechanics, and fluid dynamics---show that the critical behaviour (how the flow ceases near the sealing point) solely depends on the microscopic details of the last constriction. It appears fundamentally impossible to accurately predict from statistical properties of the surfaces alone how strongly we have to tighten a water tap to make it stop dripping and also how it starts dripping once we loosen it again.

010       Topic segmentation via community detection in complex networks
021       Many real systems have been modelled in terms of network concepts, and written texts are a particular example of information networks. 
020       In recent years, the use of network methods to analyze language has allowed the discovery of several interesting findings, including the proposition of novel models to explain the emergence of fundamental universal patterns. While syntactical networks, one of the most prevalent networked models of written texts, display both scale-free and small-world properties, such representation fails in capturing other textual features, such as the organization in topics or subjects. In this context, we propose a novel network representation whose main purpose is to capture the semantical relationships of words in a simple way. To do so, we link all words co-occurring in the same semantic context, which is defined in a threefold way. We show that the proposed representations favours the emergence of communities of semantically related words, and this feature may be used to identify relevant topics. The proposed methodology to detect topics was applied to segment selected Wikipedia articles. We have found that, in general, our methods outperform traditional bag-of-words representations, which suggests that a high-level textual representation may be useful to study semantical features of texts.

010       Thermodynamic characterization of networks using graph polynomials
021       In this paper, we present a method for characterizing the evolution of time-varying complex networks by adopting a thermodynamic representation of network structure computed from a polynomial (or algebraic) characterization of graph structure. 
020       Commencing from a representation of graph structure based on a characteristic polynomial computed from the normalized Laplacian matrix, we show how the polynomial is linked to the Boltzmann partition function of a network. This allows us to compute a number of thermodynamic quantities for the network, including the average energy and entropy. Assuming that the system does not change volume, we can also compute the temperature, defined as the rate of change of entropy with energy. All three thermodynamic variables can be approximated using low-order Taylor series that can be computed using the traces of powers of the Laplacian matrix, avoiding explicit computation of the normalized Laplacian spectrum. These polynomial approximations allow a smoothed representation of the evolution of networks to be constructed in the thermodynamic space spanned by entropy, energy, and temperature. We show how these thermodynamic variables can be computed in terms of simple network characteristics, e.g., the total number of nodes and node degree statistics for nodes connected by edges. We apply the resulting thermodynamic characterization to real-world time-varying networks representing complex systems in the financial and biological domains. The study demonstrates that the method provides an efficient tool for detecting abrupt changes and characterizing different stages in network evolution.

010       Fast extraction of the backbone of projected bipartite networks to aid   community detection
021       This paper introduces a computationally inexpensive method of extracting the backbone of one-mode networks projected from bipartite networks. 
020       We show that the edge weights in the one-mode projections are distributed according to a Poisson binomial distribution and that finding the expected weight distribution of a one-mode network projected from a random bipartite network only requires knowledge of the bipartite degree distributions. Being able to extract the backbone of a projection is highly beneficial in filtering out redundant information in large complex networks and narrowing down the information in the one-mode projection to the most relevant. We demonstrate that the backbone of a one-mode projection aids in the detection of communities.

010       Inferring topologies via driving-based generalized synchronization of   two-layer networks
021       The interaction topology among the constituents of a complex network plays a crucial role in the network's evolutionary mechanisms and functional behaviors. 
020       However, some network topologies are usually unknown or uncertain. Meanwhile, coupling delay are ubiquitous in various man-made and natural networks. Hence, it is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex dynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay. In this paper, topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated via generalized synchronization of a two-layer network. Particularly, based on the LaSalle-type invariance principle of stochastic differential delay equations, an adaptive control technique is proposed by constructing an auxiliary layer and designing proper control input and updating laws so that the unknown topology can be recovered upon successful generalized synchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The technique provides a certain theoretical basis for topology inference of complex networks. In particular, when the considered network is composed of systems with high-dimension or complicated dynamics, a simpler response layer can be constructed, which is conducive to circuit design. Moreover, it is practical to take into consideration perturbations caused by control input. Finally, the method is applicable to infer topology of a subnetwork embedded within a complex system and locate hidden sources. We hope the results can provide basic insight into further research endeavors on understanding practical and economical topology inference of networks.

010       Theoretical knock-outs on biological networks
021       In this work we formalize a method to compute the degree of importance of biological agents that participates on the dynamics of a biological phenomenon build upon a complex network. 
020       We call this new procedure by theoretical knock-out (KO). To devise this method, we make two approaches: algebraically and algorithmically. In both cases we compute a vector on an asymptotic state, called flux vector. The flux is given by a random walk on a directed graph that represents a biological phenomenon. This vector gives us the information about the relative flux of walkers on a vertex which represents a biological agent. With two vector of this kind, we can calculate the relative mean error between them by averaging over its coefficients. This quantity allows us to assess the degree of importance of each vertex of a complex network that evolves in time and has experimental background. We find out that this procedure can be applied in any sort of biological phenomena in which we can know the role and interrelationships of its agents. These results also provide experimental biologists to predict the order of importance of biological agents on a mounted complex network.

021       It is a significant challenge to predict the network topology from a small amount of dynamical observations. 
020       Different from the usual framework of the node-based reconstruction, two optimization approaches (i.e., the global and partitioned reconstructions) are proposed to infer the structure of undirected networks from dynamics. These approaches are applied to evolutionary games occurring on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks via compressed sensing, which can more efficiently achieve higher reconstruction accuracy with relatively small amounts of data. Our approaches provide different perspectives on effectively reconstructing complex networks.

010       Steady-state distributions of probability fluxes on complex networks
021       The methodology based on the random walk processes is adapted and applied to a comprehensive analysis of the statistical properties of the probability fluxes. 
020       To this aim we define a simple model of the Markovian stochastic dynamics on a complex network extended by the additional transition, called hereafter the gate. The random skips through the gate, driven by the external constant force, violate the detailed balance in the network. We argue, using a theoretical approach and numerical simulations, that the stationary distributions of the probability fluxes emergent under such conditions converge, regardless of the network topology, to the normal distribution. This result, combined with the stationary fluctuation theorem, permits to show that its standard deviation depends directly on the square root of the average flux. In turn, the central result of our paper relates this quantity to the external constant force and the two parameters that entirely characterize the normal distribution of the probability fluxes both close to as well as far from the equilibrium state. Also, the other effects that modify these parameters, such as the addition of shortcuts to the tree-like network, the extension and configuration of the gate and a change in the network size studied by means of the computer simulations are widely discussed in terms of the rigorous theoretical predictions.

010       Distress propagation in complex networks: the case of non-linear   DebtRank
021       We consider a dynamical model of distress propagation on complex networks, which we apply to the study of financial contagion in networks of banks connected to each other by direct exposures. 
020       The model that we consider is an extension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The mechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss, distress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The original DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected banks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of non-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a data-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system depends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios. We find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where small shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and that the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.

010       The second will be first: competition on directed networks
021       Multiple sinks competition is investigated for a walker diffusing on directed complex networks. 
020       The asymmetry of the imposed spatial support makes the system non transitive. As a consequence, it is always possible to identify a suitable location for the second absorbing sink that screens at most the flux of agents directed against the first trap, whose position has been preliminarily assigned. The degree of mutual competition between pairs of nodes is analytically quantified through apt indicators that build on the topological characteristics of the hosting graph. Moreover, the positioning of the second trap can be chosen so as to minimize, at the same time the probability of being in turn shaded by a thirdly added trap. Supervised placing of absorbing traps on a asymmetric disordered and complex graph is hence possible, as follows a robust optimization protocol. This latter is here discussed and successfully tested against synthetic data.

010       A mathematical model of reward and executive circuitry in obsessive   compulsive disorde
021       The neuronal circuit that controls obsessive and compulsive behaviors involves a complex network of brain regions (some with known involvement in reward processing). 
020       Among these are cortical regions, the striatum and the thalamus (which compose the CSTC pathway), limbic areas such as the amygdala and the hippocampus, and well as dopamine pathways. Abnormal dynamic behavior in this brain network is a hallmark feature of patients with increased anxiety and motor activity, like the ones affected by OCD. There is currently no clear understanding of precisely what mechanisms generates these behaviors. <br />We attempt to investigate a collection of connectivity hypotheses of OCD by means of a computational model of the brain circuitry that governs reward and motion execution. Mathematically, we use methods from ordinary differential equations and continuous time dynamical systems. We use classical analytical methods as well as computational approaches to study phenomena in the phase plane (e.g., behavior of the system's solutions when given certain initial conditions) and in the parameter space (e.g., sensitive dependence of initial conditions). <br />We find that different obsessive-compulsive subtypes may correspond to different abnormalities in the network connectivity profiles. We suggest that it is combinations of parameters (connectivity strengths between regions), rather the than the value of any one parameter taken independently, that provides the best basis for predicting behavior, and for understanding the heterogeneity of the illness.

On this basis, we propose a model to recognize the dynamic structure of a network. Then, we introduce and discuss the open issues and future work for developing the proposed recognition model.

010       The spreading ability of nodes towards localized targets in complex   networks
021       As an important type of dynamics on complex networks, spreading is widely used to model many real processes such as the epidemic contagion and information propagation. 
020       One of the most significant research questions in spreading is to rank the spreading ability of nodes in the network. To this end, substantial effort has been made and a variety of effective methods have been proposed. These methods usually define the spreading ability of a node as the number of finally infected nodes given that the spreading is initialized from the node. However, in many real cases such as advertising and medicine science the spreading only aims to cover a specific group of nodes. Therefore, it is necessary to study the spreading ability of nodes towards localized targets in complex networks. In this paper, we propose a reversed local path algorithm for this problem. Simulation results show that our method outperforms the existing methods in identifying the influential nodes with respect to these localized targets. Moreover, the influential spreaders identified by our method can effectively avoid infecting the non-target nodes in the spreading process.

010       Studies on the Structure and Dynamics of Urban Bus Networks in Indian   Cities
021       In recent times, the domain of network science has become extremely useful in understanding the underlying structure of various real-world networks and to answer non-trivial questions regarding them. 
020       In this study, we rigourously analyze the statistical properties of the bus networks of six major Indian cities as graphs in L- and P-space, using tools from network science. Although public transport networks, such as airline and railway networks have been extensively studied, a comprehensive study on the structure and growth of bus networks is lacking. In India, where bus networks play an important role in day-to-day commutation, it is of significant interest to analyze their topological structure, and answer some of the basic questions on their evolution, growth, robustness and resiliency. We start from an empirical analysis of these networks, and determine their principle characteristics in terms of the complex network theory. The common features of small-world property and heavy tails in degree-distribution plots are observed in all the networks studied. Our analysis further reveals a wide spectrum of network topologies arising due to an interplay between preferential and random attachment of nodes. Unlike real-world networks, like the Internet, WWW and airline, which are virtual, bus networks are physically constrained in two-dimensional space by the underlying road networks. In order to understand the role of constraints in the evolution of these networks, we calculate their fractal dimensions that reveal a three-dimensional space-like evolution in a constrained two-dimensional plane. We also extend our study to understand the complex dynamical processes of epidemic outbreaks and information diffusion in these networks using SI and SIR models.

010       Network complexity and topological phase transitions
021       A new type of collective excitations, due exclusively to the topology of a complex random network that can be characterized by a fractal dimension $D_F$, is investigated. 
020       We show analytically that these excitations generate phase transitions due to the non-periodic topology of the $D_F&gt;1$ complex network. An Ising system, with long range interactions over such a network, is studied in detail to support the claim. The analytic treatment is possible because the evaluation of the partition function can be decomposed into closed factor loops, in spite of the architectural complexity. This way we compute the magnetization distribution, magnetization loops, and the two point correlation function; and relate them to the network topology. In summary, the removal of the infrared divergences leads to an unconventional phase transition, where spin correlations are robust against thermal fluctuations.

010       Link prediction based on path entropy
021       Information theory has been taken as a prospective tool for quantifying the complexity of complex networks. 
020       In this paper, we first study the information entropy or uncertainty of a path using the information theory. Then we apply the path entropy to the link prediction problem in real-world networks. Specifically, we propose a new similarity index, namely Path Entropy (PE) index, which considers the information entropies of shortest paths between node pairs with penalization to long paths. Empirical experiments demonstrate that PE index outperforms the mainstream link predictors.

010       Classification of weighted networks through mesoscale homological   features
021       As complex networks find applications in a growing range of disciplines, the diversity of naturally occurring and model networks being studied is exploding. 
020       The adoption of a well-developed collection of network taxonomies is a natural method for both organizing this data and understanding deeper relationships between networks. Most existing metrics for network structure rely on classical graph-theoretic measures, extracting characteristics primarily related to individual vertices or paths between them, and thus classify networks from the perspective of local features. Here, we describe an alternative approach to studying structure in networks that relies on an algebraic-topological metric called persistent homology, which studies intrinsically mesoscale structures called cycles, constructed from cliques in the network. We present a classification of 14 commonly studied weighted network models into four groups or classes, and discuss the structural themes arising in each class. Finally, we compute the persistent homology of two real-world networks and one network constructed by a common dynamical systems model, and we compare the results with the three classes to obtain a better understanding of those networks.

010       Energy transport in the Anderson insulator
021       We study the heat conductivity in Anderson insulators in the presence of power-law interaction. 
020       Particle-hole excitations built on localized electron states are viewed as two-level systems randomly distributed in space and energy and coupled due to electron-electron interaction. A small fraction of these states form resonant pairs that in turn build a complex network allowing for energy propagation. We identify the character of energy transport through this network and evaluate the thermal conductivity. For physically relevant cases of 2D and 3D spin systems with $1/r^3$ dipole-dipole interaction (originating from the conventional $1/r$ Coulomb interaction between electrons), the found thermal conductivity $\kappa$ scales with temperature as $\kappa\propto T^3 $ and $\kappa\propto T^{4/3}$, respectively. Our results may be of relevance also to other realizations of random spin Hamiltonians with long-range interactions.

010       Community Detection in Complex Networks Using Density-based Clustering   Algorithm
021       Like clustering analysis, community detection aims at assigning nodes in a network into different communities. 
020       Fdp is a recently proposed density-based clustering algorithm which does not need the number of clusters as prior input and the result is insensitive to its parameter. However, Fdp cannot be directly applied to community detection due to its inability to recognize the community centers in the network. To solve the problem, a new community detection method (named IsoFdp) is proposed in this paper. First, we use Isomap technique to map the network data into a low dimensional manifold which can reveal diverse pair-wised similarity. Then Fdp is applied to detect the communities in networks. An improved partition density function is proposed to select the proper number of communities automatically. We test our method on both synthetic and real-world networks, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods.

020       The universal nature of velocity fluctuations in high Reynolds turbulent Helium flow is found to be inherited in the corresponding network topology. The degree distributions of the acceleration series are shown to have stretched exponential forms with the Reynolds number dependent fitting parameter. Furthermore, for acceleration time series, we find a transitional behavior in terms of the Reynolds number in all network features which is in agreement with recent empirical studies.

010       Complex Network Approach to Fractional Time Series
021       In order to extract correlation information inherited in stochastic time series, the visibility graph algorithm has been recently proposed, by which a time series can be mapped onto a complex network. 
020       We demonstrate that the visibility algorithm is not an appropriate one to study the correlation aspects of a time series. We then employ the horizontal visibility algorithm, as a much simpler one, to map fractional processes onto complex networks. The degree distributions are shown to have parabolic exponential forms with Hurst dependent fitting parameter. Further, we take into account other topological properties such as maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix and the degree assortativity, and show that such topological quantities can also be used to predict the Hurst exponent, with an exception for anti-persistent fractional Gaussian noises. To solve this problem, we take into account the Spearman correlation coefficient between nodes' degrees and their corresponding data values in the original time series.

010       Inducing chimera-synchronization in symmetric complex networks
021       In a recent study of chaos synchronization in symmetric complex networks [Pecora \textit{et al}., Nat. 
020       Commun. {\bf 5}, 4079 (2014)], it is found that stable synchronous clusters may coexist with many non-synchronous nodes in the asynchronous regime, resembling the chimera state observed in regular networks of non-locally coupled periodic oscillators. Although of practical significance, this new type of state, namely the chimera-synchronization state, is hardly generated for the general complex networks, due to either the topological instabilities or the weak coupling strength. Here, based on the strategy of pinning coupling, we propose an effective method for inducing chimera-synchronization in symmetric complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators. We are able to argue mathematically that, by pinning a group of nodes satisfying permutation symmetry, there always exits a critical pinning strength beyond which the unstable chimera-synchronization states can be successfully induced. The feasibility and efficiency of the control method are verified by numerical simulations of both artificial and real-world complex networks, with the numerical results well fitted by the theoretical predictions.

010       Evolutionary and topological properties of gene modules and driver   mutations in a leukemia gene regulatory network
021       The diverse, specialized genes in today's lifeforms evolved from a common core of ancient, elementary genes. 
020       However, these genes did not evolve individually: gene expression is controlled by a complex network of interactions, and alterations in one gene may drive reciprocal changes in its proteins' binding partners. We show that the topology of a leukemia gene regulatory network is strongly coupled with evolutionary properties. Slowly-evolving ("cold"), old genes tend to interact with each other, as do rapidly-evolving ("hot"), young genes, causing genes to evolve in clusters. We argue that gene duplication placed old, cold genes at the center of the network, and young, hot genes on the periphery, and demonstrate this with single-node centrality measures and two new measures of efficiency. Integrating centrality measures with evolutionary information, we define a medically-relevant "cancer network core," strongly enriched for common cancer mutations ($p=2\times 10^{-14}$). This could aid in identifying driver mutations and therapeutic targets.

010       Bias, Belief and Consensus: Collective opinion formation on fluctuating   networks
021       With the advent of online networks, societies are substantially more connected with individual members able to easily modify and maintain their own social links. 
020       Here, we show that active network maintenance exposes agents to confirmation bias, the tendency to confirm one's beliefs, and we explore how this affects collective opinion formation. We introduce a model of binary opinion dynamics on a complex network with fast, stochastic rewiring and show that confirmation bias induces a segregation of individuals with different opinions. We use the dynamics of global opinion to generally categorize opinion update rules and find that confirmation bias always stabilizes the consensus state. Finally, we show that the time to reach consensus has a non-monotonic dependence on the magnitude of the bias, suggesting a novel avenue for large-scale opinion engineering.

010       Controlling congestion on complex networks: fairness, efficiency and   network structure
021       We consider two elementary (max-flow and uniform-flow) and two realistic (max-min fairness and proportional fairness) congestion control schemes, and analyse how the algorithms and network structure affect throughput, the fairness of flow allocation, and the location of bottleneck edges. 
020       The more realistic proportional fairness and max-min fairness algorithms have similar throughput, but path flow allocations are more unequal in scale-free than in random regular networks. Scale-free networks have lower throughput than their random regular counterparts in the uniform-flow algorithm, which is favoured in the complex networks literature. We show, however, that this relation is reversed on all other congestion control algorithms for a region of the parameter space given by the degree exponent $\gamma$ and average degree ${k}$. Moreover, the uniform-flow algorithm severely underestimates the network throughput of congested networks, and a rich phenomenology of path flow allocations is only present in the more realistic $\alpha$-fair family of algorithms. Finally, we show that the number of paths passing through an edge characterises the location of a wide range of bottleneck edges in these algorithms. Such identification of bottlenecks could provide a bridge between the two fields of complex networks and congestion control.

010       An Empirical Comparison of Big Graph Frameworks in the Context of   Network Analysis
021       Complex networks are relational data sets commonly represented as graphs. 
020       The analysis of their intricate structure is relevant to many areas of science and commerce, and data sets may reach sizes that require distributed storage and processing. We describe and compare programming models for distributed computing with a focus on graph algorithms for large-scale complex network analysis. Four frameworks - GraphLab, Apache Giraph, Giraph++ and Apache Flink - are used to implement algorithms for the representative problems Connected Components, Community Detection, PageRank and Clustering Coefficients. The implementations are executed on a computer cluster to evaluate the frameworks' suitability in practice and to compare their performance to that of the single-machine, shared-memory parallel network analysis package NetworKit. Out of the distributed frameworks, GraphLab and Apache Giraph generally show the best performance. In our experiments a cluster of eight computers running Apache Giraph enables the analysis of a network with about 2 billion edges, which is too large for a single machine of the same type. However, for networks that fit into memory of one machine, the performance of the shared-memory parallel implementation is far better than the distributed ones. The study provides experimental evidence for selecting the appropriate framework depending on the task and data volume.

010       Growth, collapse, and self-organized criticality in complex networks
021       To understand how certain dynamical behaviors can or cannot persist as the underlying network grows is a problem of increasing importance in complex dynamical systems as well as sustainability science and engineering. 
020       We address the question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain its synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real world can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external disturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient synchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a local perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the vicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large scale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the individual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading manner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the networked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the synchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to identify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of linear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the addition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose synchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A statistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the collapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations in the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized criticality. We demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon of synchronization collapse using a variety of complex network models, and uncover the underlying dynamical mechanism through an eigenvector analysis.

010       Mutual synchronization of spin torque nano-oscillators through a   non-local and tunable electrical coupling
021       The concept of spin torque driven high frequency magnetization dynamics has opened up the field of spintronics to non-linear physics, potentially in complex networks of dynamical systems. 
020       In the scarce demonstrations of synchronized spin-torque oscillators, the local nature of the magnetic coupling that is used have largely hampered a good understanding and thus the control of the synchronization process. Here we take advantage of the non-local nature of an electrical coupling to mutually synchronize spin-torque oscillators through their self-emitted microwave currents. The control of the synchronized state is achieved at the nanoscale through two active components of spin transfer torques, but also externally through an electrical delay line. These additional levels of control of the synchronization capability provide new approaches to underlie a large variety of nanoscale collective dynamics in complex networks.

020       On the other hands, it is a horrible job to compute some stochastic parameters of a large network having thousand and thousand nodes. We design several recursive algorithms for finding spanning trees having maximal leaves (MLS-trees) in investigation of topological structures of Sierpinski growing network models, and use MLS-trees to determine the kernels, dominating and balanced sets of the models. We propose a new stochastic method for the models, called the edge-cumulative distribution, and show that it obeys a power law distribution.

010       Analytical Solution for the Size of the Minimum Dominating Set in   Complex Networks
021       Domination is the fastest-growing field within graph theory with a profound diversity and impact in real-world applications, such as the recent breakthrough approach that identifies optimized subsets of proteins enriched with cancer-related genes. 
020       Despite its conceptual simplicity, domination is a classical NP-complete decision problem which makes analytical solutions elusive and poses difficulties to design optimization algorithms for finding a dominating set of minimum cardinality in a large network. Here we derive for the first time an approximate analytical solution for the density of the minimum dominating set (MDS) by using a combination of cavity method and Ultra-Discretization (UD) procedure. The derived equation allows us to compute the size of MDS by only using as an input the information of the degree distribution of a given network.

010       A complex network theory approach for optimizing contamination warning   sensor location in water distribution networks
021       Drinking water for human health and well-being is crucial. 
020       Accidental and intentional water contamination can pose great danger to consumers. Optimal design of a system that can quickly detect the presence of contamination in a water distribution network is very challenging for technical and operational reasons. However, on the one hand improvement in chemical and biological sensor technology has created the possibility of designing efficient contamination detection systems. On the other hand, methods and tools from complex network theory, which was primarily the domain of mathematicians and physicists, provide analytical output for engineers to design, optimize, operate, and maintain complex network systems such as power grids, water distribution networks, telecommunication systems, internet, roads, supply chains, traffic and transportation systems. In this work, we develop a new modeling approach for the optimal placement of sensors for contamination detection in a water distribution network. The approach originally combines classical optimization and complex systems theory.

010       Linear and Optimization Hamiltonians in Clustered Exponential Random   Graph Modeling
021       Exponential random graph theory is the complex network analog of the canonical ensemble theory from statistical physics. 
020       While it has been particularly successful in modeling networks with specified degree distributions, a naive model of a clustered network using a graph Hamiltonian linear in the number of triangles has been shown to undergo an abrupt transition into an unrealistic phase of extreme clustering via triangle condensation. Here we study a non-linear graph Hamiltonian that explicitly forbids such a condensation and show numerically that it generates an equilibrium phase with specified intermediate clustering.

010       The Hayastan Shakarian cut: measuring the impact of network   disconnections
021       In this article we present the Hayastan Shakarian (HS), a robustness index for complex networks. 
020       HS measures the impact of a network disconnection (edge) while comparing the sizes of the remaining connected components. Strictly speaking, the Hayastan Shakarian index is defined as edge removal that produces the maximal inverse of the size of the largest connected component divided by the sum of the sizes of the remaining ones. <br />We tested our index in attack strategies where the nodes are disconnected in decreasing order of a specified metric. We considered using the Hayastan Shakarian cut (disconnecting the edge with max HS) and other well-known strategies as the higher betweenness centrality disconnection. All strategies were compared regarding the behavior of the robustness (R-index) during the attacks. In an attempt to simulate the internet backbone, the attacks were performed in complex networks with power-law degree distributions (scale-free networks). <br />Preliminary results show that attacks based on disconnecting using the Hayastan Shakarian cut are more dangerous (decreasing the robustness) than the same attacks based on other centrality measures. We believe that the Hayastan Shakarian cut, as well as other measures based on the size of the largest connected component, provides a good addition to other robustness metrics for complex networks.

010       The hidden geometry of weighted complex networks
021       The topology of many real complex networks has been conjectured to be embedded in hidden metric spaces, where distances between nodes encode their likelihood of being connected. 
020       Besides of providing a natural geometrical interpretation of their complex topologies, this hypothesis yields the recipe for sustainable Internet's routing protocols, sheds light on the hierarchical organization of biochemical pathways in cells, and allows for a rich characterization of the evolution of international trade. We present empirical evidence that this geometric interpretation also applies to the weighted organisation of real complex networks. We introduce a very general and versatile model and use it to quantify the level of coupling between their topology, their weights, and an underlying metric space. Our model accurately reproduces both their topology and their weights, and our results suggest that the formation of connections and the assignment of their magnitude are ruled by different processes.

010       Nonlinear Consensus Strategies for Multi-Agent Networks in Presence of   Communication Delays and Switching Topologies: Real-Time Receding Horizon   Approach
021       This paper presents a novel framework which combines a non-iterative solution of Real-Time Nonlinear Receding Horizon Control (NRHC) methodology to achieve consensus within complex network topologies with existing time-delays and in presence of switching topologies. 
020       In this formulation, we solve the distributed nonlinear optimization problem for multi-agent network systems directly, \emph{in real-time}, without any dependency on iterative processes, where the stability and convergence guarantees are provided for the solution. Three benchmark examples on non-linear chaotic systems provide validated results which demonstrate the significant outcomes of such methodology.

010       Nonlinear waves on circle networks with excitable nodes
021       Nonlinear wave formation and propagation on a complex network with excitable node dynamics is of fundamental interest in diverse fields in science and engineering. 
020       Here, we propose a new model of the Kuramoto type to study nonlinear wave generation and propagation on circular subgraphs of a complex network. On circle networks, in the continuum limit, this model is equivalent to the over-damped Frenkel-Kontorova model. The new model is shown to keep the essential features of those well-known models such as the diffusively coupled B\"ar-Eiswirth model but with much simplified expression such that analytic analysis becomes possible. We classify traveling wave solutions on circle networks and show the universality of its features with perturbation analysis and numerical computation.

010       Pattern Formation on Networks: from Localised Activity to Turing   Patterns
021       Systems of dynamical interactions between competing species can be used to model many complex systems, and can be mathematically described by {\em random} networks. 
020       Understanding how patterns of activity arise in such systems is important for understanding many natural phenomena. The emergence of patterns of activity on complex networks with reaction-diffusion dynamics on the nodes is studied here. The connection between solutions with a single activated node, which can bifurcate from an undifferentiated state, and the fully developed system-scale patterns are investigated computationally. The different coexisting patterns of activity the network can exhibit are shown to be connected via a snaking type bifurcation structure, similar to those responsible for organising localised pattern formation in regular lattices. These results reveal the origin of the multistable patterns found in systems organised on complex networks. A key role is found to be played by nodes with so called {\em optimal degree}, on which the interaction between the reaction kinetics and the network structure organise the behaviour of the system. A statistical representation of the density of solutions over the parameter space is used as a means to answer important questions about the number of accessible states that can be exhibited in systems with such a high degree of complexity.

010       Global multi-layer network of human mobility
021       Recent availability of geo-localized data capturing individual human activity together with the statistical data on international migration opened up unprecedented opportunities for a study on global mobility. 
020       In this paper we consider it from the perspective of a multi-layer complex network, built using a combination of three datasets: Twitter, Flickr and official migration data. Those datasets provide different but equally important insights on the global mobility: while the first two highlight short-term visits of people from one country to another, the last one - migration - shows the long-term mobility perspective, when people relocate for good. And the main purpose of the paper is to emphasize importance of this multi-layer approach capturing both aspects of human mobility at the same time. So we start from a comparative study of the network layers, comparing short- and long- term mobility through the statistical properties of the corresponding networks, such as the parameters of their degree centrality distributions or parameters of the corresponding gravity model being fit to the network. We also focus on the differences in country ranking by their short- and long-term attractiveness, discussing the most noticeable outliers. Finally, we apply this multi-layered human mobility network to infer the structure of the global society through a community detection approach and demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a multi-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way more consistent with other available relevant sources of international connections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network layer taken separately.

010       Universality in random quantum networks
021       Networks constitute efficient tools for assessing universal features of complex systems. 
020       In physical contexts, classical as well as quantum, networks are used to describe a wide range of phenomena, such as phase transitions, intricate aspects of many-body quantum systems or even characteristic features of a future quantum internet. Random quantum networks and their associated directed graphs are employed for capturing statistically dominant features of complex quantum systems. Here, we develop an efficient iterative method capable of evaluating the probability of a graph being strongly connected. It is proven that random directed graphs with constant edge-establishing probability are typically strongly connected, i.e. any ordered pair of vertices is connected by a directed path. This typical topological property of directed random graphs is exploited to demonstrate universal features of the asymptotic evolution of large random qubit networks. These results are independent of our knowledge of the details of the network topology. These findings suggest that also other highly complex networks, such as a future quantum internet, may exhibit similar universal properties.

010       Controllability of complex networks using perturbation theory of extreme   singular values
021       Pinning control on complex dynamical networks has emerged as a very important topic in recent trends of control theory due to the extensive study of collective coupled behaviors and their role in physics, engineering and biology. 
020       In practice, real-world networks consists of a large number of vertices and one may only be able to perform a control on a fraction of them only. Controllability of such systems has been addressed in \cite{PorfiriDiBernardo:Automatica08}, where it was reformulated as a global asymptotic stability problem. The goal of this short note is to refine the analysis proposed in \cite{PorfiriDiBernardo:Automatica08} using recent results in singular value perturbation theory.

010       Network structure of subway passenger flows
021       The results of transportation infrastructure network analyses have been used to analyze complex networks in a topological context. 
020       However, most modeling approaches, including those based on complex network theory, do not fully account for real-life traffic patterns and may provide an incomplete view of network functions. This study utilizes trip data obtained from the Beijing Subway System to characterize individual passenger movement patterns. A directed weighted passenger flow network was constructed from the subway infrastructure network topology by incorporating trip data. The passenger flow networks exhibit several properties that can be characterized by power-law distributions based on flow size, and log-logistic distributions based on the fraction of boarding and departing passengers. The study also characterizes the temporal patterns of in-transit and waiting passengers and provides a hierarchical clustering structure for passenger flows. This hierarchical flow organization varies in the spatial domain. Ten cluster groups were identified, indicating a hierarchical urban polycentric structure composed of large concentrated flows at urban activity centers. These empirical findings provide insights regarding urban human mobility patterns within a large subway network.

010       Latent Network Features and Overlapping Community Discovery via Boolean   Intersection Representations
021       We propose a new latent Boolean feature model for complex networks that captures different types of node interactions and network communities. 
020       The model is based on a new concept in graph theory, termed the Boolean intersection representation of a graph, which generalizes the notion of an intersection representation. We mostly focus on one form of Boolean intersection, termed cointersection, and describe how to use this representation to deduce node feature sets and their communities. We derive several general bounds on the minimum number of features used in cointersection representations and discuss graph families for which exact cointersection characterizations are possible. Our results also include algorithms for finding optimal and approximate cointersection representations of a graph.

010       Greedy reduction of navigation time in random search processes
021       Random search processes are instrumental in studying and understanding navigation properties of complex networks, food search strategies of animals, diffusion control of molecular processes in biological cells, and improving web search engines. 
020       An essential part of random search processes and their applications are various forms of (continuous or discrete time) random walk models. The efficiency of a random search strategy in complex networks is measured with the mean first passage time between two nodes or, more generally, with the mean first passage time between two subsets of the vertex set. In this paper we formulate a problem of adding a set of $k$ links between the two subsets of the vertex set that optimally reduce the mean first passage time between the sets. We demonstrate that the mean first passage time between two sets is non-increasing and supermodular set function defined over the set of links between the two sets. This allows us to use two greedy algorithms that approximately solve the problem and we compare their performance against several standard link prediction algorithms. We find that the proposed greedy algorithms are better at choosing the links that reduce the navigation time between the two sets.

010       Centrality Measures for Networks with Community Structure
021       Understanding the network structure, and finding out the influential nodes is a challenging issue in the large networks. 
020       Identifying the most influential nodes in the network can be useful in many applications like immunization of nodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex networks. A lot of research is done to devise centrality measures which could efficiently identify the most influential nodes in the network. There are two major approaches to the problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that exploit knowledge about the overall network topology in order to find the influential nodes, while on the other end, random strategies are completely agnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a limited knowledge of the network structure are required. Indeed, in practice, information about the global structure of the overall network is rarely available or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network might be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate global centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed that requires information only at the community level to identify the influential nodes in the network. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a community structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the influential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global deterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies with an available and the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and real-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of nodes for epidemic control.

Further, 16 key hub genes (Col4a1, Lcn2, Cdk4, etc.) are determined by introducing an integrated centrality and have been confirmed by biological/medical research to play important roles in hypertension.

010       Hierarchical organization of functional connectivity in the mouse brain:   a complex network approach
021       This paper represents a contribution to the study of the brain functional connectivity from the perspective of complex networks theory. 
020       More specifically, we apply graph theoretical analyses to provide evidence of the modular structure of the mouse brain and to shed light on its hierarchical organization. We propose a novel percolation analysis and we apply our approach to the analysis of a resting-state functional MRI data set from 41 mice. This approach reveals a robust hierarchical structure of modules persistent across different subjects. Importantly, we test this approach against a statistical benchmark (or null model) which constrains only the distributions of empirical correlations. Our results unambiguously show that the hierarchical character of the mouse brain modular structure is not trivially encoded into this lower-order constraint. Finally, we investigate the modular structure of the mouse brain by computing the Minimal Spanning Forest, a technique that identifies subnetworks characterized by the strongest internal correlations. This approach represents a faster alternative to other community detection methods and provides a means to rank modules on the basis of the strength of their internal edges.

010       A pathway-based network analysis of hypertension-related genes
021       Complex network approach has become an effective way to describe interrelationships among large amounts of biological data, which is especially useful in finding core functions and global behavior of biological systems. 
020       Hypertension is a complex disease caused by many reasons including genetic, physiological, psychological and even social factors. In this paper, based on the information of biological pathways, we construct a network model of hypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the interrelationship between genes. Statistical and topological characteristics show that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and exhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among these genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven key hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb3l2, Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da. These genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the treatment of hypertension should focus on the combination of drugs on multiple genes.

010       Multifractal and Network Analysis of Phase Transition
021       Many models and real complex systems possess critical thresholds at which the systems shift from one sate to another. 
020       The discovery of the early warnings of the systems in the vicinity of critical point are of great importance to estimate how far a system is from a critical threshold. Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and visibility graph method have been employed to investigate the fluctuation and geometrical structures of magnetization time series of two-dimensional Ising model around critical point. The Hurst exponent has been confirmed to be a good indicator of phase transition. Increase of the multifractality of the time series have been observed from generalized Hurst exponents and singularity spectrum. Both Long-term correlation and broad probability density function are identified to be the sources of multifractality of time series near critical regime. Heterogeneous nature of the networks constructed from magnetization time series have validated the fractal properties of magnetization time series from complex network perspective. Evolution of the topology quantities such as clustering coefficient, average degree, average shortest path length, density, assortativity and heterogeneity serve as early warnings of phase transition. Those methods and results can provide new insights about analysis of phase transition problems and can be used as early warnings for various complex systems.

010       Ensemble equivalence for distinguishable particles
021       Statistics of distinguishable particles has become relevant in systems of colloidal particles and in the context of applications of statistical mechanics to complex networks. 
020       When studying these type of systems with the standard textbook formalism, non-physical results such as non-extensive entropies are obtained. In this paper, we will show that the commonly used expression for the partition function of a system of distinguishable particles leads to huge fluctuations of the number of particles in the grand canonical ensemble and, consequently, to non-equivalence of statistical ensembles. We will see how a new proposed definition for the entropy of distinguishable particles by Swendsen [J. Stat. Phys. 107, 1143 (2002)] solves the problem and restores ensemble equivalence. We also show that the new proposal for the partition function does not produce any inconsistency for a system of distinguishable localized particles, where the monoparticular partition function is not extensive.

010       Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks
021       Identifying a set of influential spreaders in complex networks plays a crucial role in effective information spreading. 
020       A simple strategy is to choose top-$r$ ranked nodes as spreaders according to influence ranking method such as PageRank, ClusterRank and $k$-shell decomposition. Besides, some heuristic methods such as hill-climbing, SPIN, degree discount and independent set based are also proposed. However, these approaches suffer from a possibility that some spreaders are so close together that they overlap sphere of influence or time consuming. In this report, we present a simply yet effectively iterative method named VoteRank to identify a set of decentralized spreaders with the best spreading ability. In this approach, all nodes vote in a spreader in each turn, and the voting ability of neighbors of elected spreader will be decreased in subsequent turn. Experimental results on four real networks show that under Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, VoteRank outperforms the traditional benchmark methods on both spreading speed and final affected scale. What's more, VoteRank is also superior to other group-spreader identifying methods on computational time.

010       Burstiness and fractional diffusion on complex networks
021       Many dynamical processes on real world networks display complex temporal patterns as, for instance, a fat-tailed distribution of inter-events times, leading to heterogeneous waiting times between events. 
020       In this work, we focus on distributions whose average inter-event time diverges, and study its impact on the dynamics of random walkers on networks. The process can naturally be described, in the long time limit, in terms of Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives. We show that all the dynamical modes possess, in the asymptotic regime, the same power law relaxation, which implies that the dynamics does not exhibit time-scale separation between modes, and that no mode can be neglected versus another one, even for long times. Our results are then confirmed by numerical simulations.

010       A Unified Framework for Information Consumption Based on Markov Chains
021       This paper establishes a Markov chain model as a unified framework for understanding information consumption processes in complex networks, with clear implications to the Internet and big-data technologies. 
020       In particular, the proposed model is the first one to address the formation mechanism of the "trichotomy" in observed probability density functions from empirical data of various social and technical networks. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate a good match of the proposed model with real datasets, showing its superiority over the classical power-law models.

010       Accelerating Local Search for the Maximum Independent Set Problem
021       Computing high-quality independent sets quickly is an important problem in combinatorial optimization. 
020       Several recent algorithms have shown that kernelization techniques can be used to find exact maximum independent sets in medium-sized sparse graphs, as well as high-quality independent sets in huge sparse graphs that are intractable for exact (exponential-time) algorithms. However, a major drawback of these algorithms is that they require significant preprocessing overhead, and therefore cannot be used to find a high-quality independent set quickly. <br />In this paper, we show that performing simple kernelization techniques in an online fashion significantly boosts the performance of local search, and is much faster than pre-computing a kernel using advanced techniques. In addition, we show that cutting high-degree vertices can boost local search performance even further, especially on huge (sparse) complex networks. Our experiments show that we can drastically speed up the computation of large independent sets compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms, while also producing results that are very close to the best known solutions.

010       Recovery rate affects the effective epidemic threshold with synchronous   updating
021       Accurate identification of effective epidemic threshold is essential for understanding epidemic dynamics on complex networks. 
020       The existing studies on the effective epidemic threshold of the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model generally assume that all infected nodes immediately recover after the infection process, which more or less does not conform to the realistic situation of disease. In this paper, we systematically study the effect of arbitrary recovery rate on the SIR spreading dynamics on complex networks. We derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size based on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical predictions and numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world networks. Our results extend the existing theoretical studies, and help us to understand the phase transition with arbitrary recovery rate.

010       Self-induced switchings between multiple space-time patterns on complex   networks of excitable units
021       We report on self-induced switchings between multiple distinct space--time patterns in the dynamics of a spatially extended excitable system. 
020       These switchings between low-amplitude oscillations, nonlinear waves, and extreme events strongly resemble a random process, although the system is deterministic. We show that a chaotic saddle -- which contains all the patterns as well as channel-like structures that mediate the transitions between them -- is the backbone of such a pattern switching dynamics. Our analyses indicate that essential ingredients for the observed phenomena are that the system behaves like an inhomogeneous oscillatory medium that is capable of self-generating spatially localized excitations and that is dominated by short-range connections but also features long-range connections. With our findings, we present an alternative to the well-known ways to obtain self-induced pattern switching, namely noise-induced attractor hopping, heteroclinic orbits, and adaptation to an external signal. This alternative way can be expected to improve our understanding of pattern switchings in spatially extended natural dynamical systems like the brain and the heart.

010       Higher order assortativity in complex networks
021       Assortativity was first introduced by Newman and has been extensively studied and applied to many real world networked systems since then. 
020       Assortativity is a graph metrics and describes the tendency of high degree nodes to be directly connected to high degree nodes and low degree nodes to low degree nodes. It can be interpreted as a first order measure of the connection between nodes, i.e. the first autocorrelation of the degree-degree vector. Even though assortativity has been used so extensively, to the author's knowledge, no attempt has been made to extend it theoretically. This is the scope of our paper. We will introduce higher order assortativity by extending the Newman index based on a suitable choice of the matrix driving the connections. Higher order assortativity will be defined for paths, shortest paths, random walks of a given time length, connecting any couple of nodes. The Newman assortativity is achieved for each of these measures when the matrix is the adjacency matrix, or, in other words, the correlation is of order 1. Our higher order assortativity indexes can be used for describing a variety of real networks, help discriminating networks having the same Newman index and may reveal new topological network features.

010       A multiscale model of distributed fracture and permeability in solids in   all-round compression
021       We present a microstructural model of permeability in fractured solids, where the fractures are described in terms of recursive families of parallel, equidistant cohesive faults. 
020       Faults originate upon the attainment of a tensile or shear resistance in the undamaged material. Secondary faults may form in a hierarchical orga- nization, creating a complex network of connected fractures that modify the permeability of the solid. The undamaged solid may possess initial porosity and permeability. The particular geometry of the superposed micro-faults lends itself to an explicit analytical quantification of the porosity and permeability of the dam- aged material. The approach is particularly appealing as a means of modeling low permeability oil and gas reservoirs stimulated by hydraulic fracturing.

010       A Graph-Theoretic Approach to Efficient Voice-Leading

020       We quantify the relative importance of particular chords within this framework. The graph-theoretic notion of eccentricity suggests that when working in a harmonic scheme dictated by any common musical scale, no triad is any more isolated than any other. Complex network theory refines this idea, and in this context provides measures of how important particular triads might be for the flow of chord progressions through the harmonic network. We review and compare several different such measures of centrality and communicability.

010       Dynamics of &quot;comb-of-comb&quot; networks
021       The dynamics of complex networks, being a current hot topic of many scientific fields, is often coded through the corresponding Laplacian matrix. 
020       The spectrum of this matrix carries the main features of the networks' dynamics. Here we consider the deterministic networks which can be viewed as "comb-of-comb" iterative structures. For their Laplacian spectra we find analytical equations involving Chebyshev polynomials, whose properties allow one to analyze the spectra in deep. Here, in particular, we find that in the infinite size limit the corresponding spectral dimension goes as $d_s\rightarrow2$. The $d_s$ leaves its fingerprint in many dynamical processes, as we exeplarily show by considering the dynamical properties of the polymer networks, including single monomer displacement under a constant force, mechanical relaxation, and fluorescence depolarization.

010       On the topologic structure of economic complex networks: Empirical   evidence from large scale payment network of Estonia
021       This paper presents the first topological analysis of the economic structure of an entire country based on payments data obtained from Swedbank. 
020       This data set is exclusive in its kind because around 80% of Estonia's bank transactions are done through Swedbank, hence, the economic structure of the country can be reconstructed. Scale-free networks are commonly observed in a wide array of different contexts such as nature and society. In this paper, the nodes are comprised by customers of the bank (legal entities) and the links are established by payments between these nodes. We study the scaling-free and structural properties of this network. We also describe its topology, components and behaviors. We show that this network shares typical structural characteristics known in other complex networks: degree distributions follow a power law, low clustering coefficient and low average shortest path length. We identify the key nodes of the network and perform simulations of resiliency against random and targeted attacks of the nodes with two different approaches. With this, we find that by identifying and studying the links between the nodes is possible to perform vulnerability analysis of the Estonian economy with respect to economic shocks.

010       Complex Networks of Words in Fables
021       In this chapter we give an overview of the application of complex network theory to quantify some properties of language. 
020       Our study is based on two fables in Ukrainian, Mykyta the Fox and Abu-Kasym's slippers. It consists of two parts: the analysis of frequency-rank distributions of words and the application of complex-network theory. The first part shows that the text sizes are sufficiently large to observe statistical properties. This supports their selection for the analysis of typical properties of the language networks in the second part of the chapter. In describing language as a complex network, while words are usually associated with nodes, there is more variability in the choice of links and different representations result in different networks. Here, we examine a number of such representations of the language network and perform a comparative analysis of their characteristics. Our results suggest that, irrespective of link representation, the Ukrainian language network used in the selected fables is a strongly correlated, scale-free, small world. We discuss how such empirical approaches may help form a useful basis for a theoretical description of language evolution and how they may be used in analyses of other textual narratives.

010       Multifractality and Laplace spectrum of horizontal visibility graphs   constructed from fractional Brownian motions
021       Many studies have shown that additional information can be gained on time series by investigating their associated complex networks. 
020       In this work, we investigate the multifractal property and Laplace spectrum of the horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed from fractional Brownian motions. We aim to identify via simulation and curve fitting the form of these properties in terms of the Hurst index $H$. First, we use the sandbox algorithm to study the multifractality of these HVGs. It is found that multifractality exists in these HVGs. We find that the average fractal dimension $\langle D(0)\rangle$ of HVGs approximately satisfies the prominent linear formula $\langle D(0)\rangle = 2 - H$; while the average information dimension $\langle D(1)\rangle$ and average correlation dimension $\langle D(2)\rangle$ are all approximately bi-linear functions of $H$ when $H\ge 0.15$. Then, we calculate the spectrum and energy for the general Laplacian operator and normalized Laplacian operator of these HVGs. We find that, for the general Laplacian operator, the average logarithm of second-smallest eigenvalue $\langle \ln (u_2) \rangle$, the average logarithm of third-smallest eigenvalue $\langle \ln (u_3) \rangle$, and the average logarithm of maximum eigenvalue $\langle \ln (u_n) \rangle$ of these HVGs are approximately linear functions of $H$; while the average Laplacian energy $\langle E_{nL} \rangle$ is approximately a quadratic polynomial function of $H$. For the normalized Laplacian operator, $\langle \ln (u_2) \rangle$ and $\langle \ln (u_3) \rangle$ of these HVGs approximately satisfy linear functions of $H$; while $\langle \ln (u_n) \rangle$ and $\langle E_{nL} \rangle$ are approximately a 4th and cubic polynomial function of $H$ respectively.

010       Exploring triad-rich substructures by graph-theoretic characterizations   in complex networks
021       One of the most important problems in complex networks is how to detect metadata groups accurately. 
020       The main challenge lies in the fact that traditional structural communities do not always capture the intrinsic features of metadata groups. Motivated by the observation that metadata groups in PPI networks tend to consist of an abundance of interacting triad motifs, we define a 2-club substructure with diameter 2 which possessing triad-rich property to describe a metadata group. Based on the triad-rich substructure, we design a DIVision Algorithm using our proposed edge Niche Centrality DIVANC to detect metadata groups effectively in complex networks. We also extend DIVANC to detect overlapping metadata groups by proposing a simple 2-hop overlapping strategy. To verify the effectiveness of triad-rich substructures, we compare DIVANC with existing algorithms on PPI networks, LFR synthetic networks and football networks. The experimental results show that DIVANC outperforms most other algorithms significantly and, in particular, can detect sparse metadata groups.

010       Networks of plants: how to measure similarity in vegetable species
021       Despite the common misconception of nearly static organisms, plants do interact continuously with the environment and with each other. 
020       It is fair to assume that during their evolution they developed particular features to overcome problems and to exploit possibilities from environment. In this paper we introduce various quantitative measures based on recent advancements in complex network theory that allow to measure the effective similarities of various species. By using this approach on the similarity in fruit-typology ecological traits we obtain a clear plant classification in a way similar to traditional taxonomic classification. This result is not trivial, since a similar analysis done on the basis of diaspore morphological properties do not provide any clear parameter to classify plants species. Complex network theory can then be used in order to determine which feature amongst many can be used to distinguish scope and possibly evolution of plants. Future uses of this approach range from functional classification to quantitative determination of plant communities in nature.

010       Optimal synchronization of directed complex networks
021       We study optimal synchronization of networks of coupled phase oscillators. 
020       We extend previous theory for optimizing the synchronization properties of undirected networks to the important case of directed networks. We derive a generalized synchrony alignment function that encodes the interplay between network structure and the oscillators' natural frequencies and serves as an objective measure for the network's degree of synchronization. Using the generalized synchrony alignment function, we show that a network's synchronization properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also allows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in particular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal in- and out-degrees. For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks the heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship emerges for out-degrees. We also observe that a network's synchronization properties are promoted by a strong correlation between the nodal in-degrees and the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between the nodal out-degrees and the natural frequencies has comparatively little effect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that synchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies with the left singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the Laplacian matrix.

010       Machine learning meets network science: dimensionality reduction for   fast and efficient embedding of networks in the hyperbolic space
021       Complex network topologies and hyperbolic geometry seem specularly connected, and one of the most fascinating and challenging problems of recent complex network theory is to map a given network to its hyperbolic space. 
020       The Popularity Similarity Optimization (PSO) model represents - at the moment - the climax of this theory. It suggests that the trade-off between node popularity and similarity is a mechanism to explain how complex network topologies emerge - as discrete samples - from the continuous world of hyperbolic geometry. The hyperbolic space seems appropriate to represent real complex networks. In fact, it preserves many of their fundamental topological properties, and can be exploited for real applications such as, among others, link prediction and community detection. Here, we observe for the first time that a topological-based machine learning class of algorithms - for nonlinear unsupervised dimensionality reduction - can directly approximate the network's node angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model into a two-dimensional space, according to a similar topological organization that we named angular coalescence. On the basis of this phenomenon, we propose a new class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate coalescent embedding of networks in the hyperbolic space even for graphs with thousands of nodes.

Modelling these networked, ecological interactions at the same time is still an open challenge. We present a novel spatially-embedded multiplex network framework for modelling multi-host infection spreading through multiple routes of transmission. Our model is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial mechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which nodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a parasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in two different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one. Our simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread when both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with equal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may have additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of vectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread, (ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite transmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the same fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex topology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in parasite transmission in a given ecosystem. We also show that the multiplex models provide a richer phenomenology in terms of parasite spreading dynamics compared to mono-layer models. Our work opens new challenges and provides new quantitative tools for modelling multi-channel spreading in networked systems.

010       The noisy voter model on complex networks
021       We propose a new analytical method to study stochastic, binary-state models on complex networks. 
020       Moving beyond the usual mean-field theories, this alternative approach is based on the introduction of an annealed approximation for uncorrelated networks, allowing to deal with the network structure as parametric heterogeneity. As an illustration, we study the noisy voter model, a modification of the original voter model including random changes of state. The proposed method is able to unfold the dependence of the model not only on the mean degree (the mean-field prediction) but also on more complex averages over the degree distribution. In particular, we find that the degree heterogeneity ---variance of the underlying degree distribution--- has a strong influence on the location of the critical point of a noise-induced, finite-size transition occurring in the model, on the local ordering of the system, and on the functional form of its temporal correlations. Finally, we show how this latter point opens the possibility of inferring the degree heterogeneity of the underlying network by observing only the aggregate behavior of the system as a whole, an issue of interest for systems where only macroscopic, population level variables can be measured.

010       The effect of social welfare system based on the complex network
021       With the passage of time, the development of communication technology and transportation broke the isolation among people. 
020       Relationship tends to be complicated, pluralism, dynamism. In the network where interpersonal relationship and evolved complex net based on game theory work serve respectively as foundation architecture and theoretical model, with the combination of game theory and regard public welfare as influencing factor, we artificially initialize that closed network system. Through continual loop operation of the program, we summarize the changing rule of the cooperative behavior in the interpersonal relationship, so that we can analyze the policies about welfare system about whole network and the relationship of frequency of betrayal in cooperative behavior. Most analytical data come from some simple investigations and some estimates based on internet and environment and the study put emphasis on simulating social network and analyze influence of social welfare system on Cooperative Behavio.

010       Congestion induced by the structure of multiplex networks
021       Multiplex networks are representations of multilayer interconnected complex networks where the nodes are the same at every layer. 
020       They turn out to be good abstractions of the intricate connectivity of multimodal transportation networks, among other types of complex systems. One of the most important critical phenomena arising in such networks is the emergence of congestion in transportation flows. Here we prove analytically that the structure of multiplex networks can induce congestion for flows that otherwise will be decongested if the individual layers were not interconnected. We provide explicit equations for the onset of congestion and approximations that allow to compute this onset from individual descriptors of the individual layers. The observed cooperative phenomenon reminds the Braess' paradox in which adding extra capacity to a network when the moving entities selfishly choose their route can in some cases reduce overall performance. Similarly, in the multiplex structure, the efficiency in transportation can unbalance the transportation loads resulting in unexpected congestion.

010       Extracting Information from Multiplex Networks
021       Multiplex networks are generalized network structures that are able to describe networks in which the same set of nodes are connected by links that have different connotations. 
020       Multiplex networks are ubiquitous since they describe social, financial, engineering and biological networks as well. Extending our ability to analyze complex networks to multiplex network structures increases greatly the level of information that is possible to extract from Big Data. For these reasons characterizing the centrality of nodes in multiplex networks and finding new ways to solve challenging inference problems defined on multiplex networks are fundamental questions of network science. In this paper we discuss the relevance of the Multiplex PageRank algorithm for measuring the centrality of nodes in multilayer networks and we characterize the utility of the recently introduced indicator function $\widetilde{\Theta}^{S}$ for describing their mesoscale organization and community structure. As working examples for studying these measures we consider three multiplex network datasets coming for social science.

010       A Complex-Network Perspective on Alexander&#x27;s Wholeness
021       The wholeness, conceived and developed by Christopher Alexander, is what exists to some degree or other in space and matter, and can be described by precise mathematical language. 
020       However, it remains somehow mysterious and elusive, and therefore hard to grasp. This paper develops a complex network perspective on the wholeness to better understand the nature of order or beauty for sustainable design. I bring together a set of complexity-science subjects such as complex networks, fractal geometry, and in particular underlying scaling hierarchy derived by head/tail breaks - a classification scheme and a visualization tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution, in order to make Alexander's profound thoughts more accessible to design practitioners and complexity-science researchers. Through several case studies (some of which Alexander studied), I demonstrate that the complex-network perspective helps reduce the mystery of wholeness and brings new insights to Alexander's thoughts on the concept of wholeness or objective beauty that exists in fine and deep structure. The complex-network perspective enables us to see things in their wholeness, and to better understand how the kind of structural beauty emerges from local actions guided by the 15 fundamental properties, and by differentiation and adaptation processes. The wholeness goes beyond current complex network theory towards design or creation of living structures. <br />Keywords: Theory of centers, living geometry, Christopher Alexander, head/tail breaks, and beauty

010       On Complex Valued Convolutional Neural Networks
021       Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the cutting edge model for supervised machine learning in computer vision. 
020       In recent years CNNs have outperformed traditional approaches in many computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification and face recognition. CNNs are vulnerable to overfitting, and a lot of research focuses on finding regularization methods to overcome it. One approach is designing task specific models based on prior knowledge. <br />Several works have shown that properties of natural images can be easily captured using complex numbers. Motivated by these works, we present a variation of the CNN model with complex valued input and weights. We construct the complex model as a generalization of the real model. Lack of order over the complex field raises several difficulties both in the definition and in the training of the network. We address these issues and suggest possible solutions. <br />The resulting model is shown to be a restricted form of a real valued CNN with twice the parameters. It is sensitive to phase structure, and we suggest it serves as a regularized model for problems where such structure is important. This suggestion is verified empirically by comparing the performance of a complex and a real network in the problem of cell detection. The two networks achieve comparable results, and although the complex model is hard to train, it is significantly less vulnerable to overfitting. We also demonstrate that the complex network detects meaningful phase structure in the data.

010       Disease spread through animal movements: a static and temporal network   analysis of pig trade in Germany
021       Background: Animal trade plays an important role for the spread of infectious diseases in livestock populations. 
020       As a case study, we consider pig trade in Germany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The central question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the system of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying network of animal movements. <br />Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases. Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system using different network models, which include varying amounts of information: (i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots, (iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account. <br />Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a topological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures using centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in particular for an accurate calculation of the maximum outbreak size.

021       We present new conditions to obtain synchronization and consensus patterns in complex network systems. 
020       The key idea is to exploit symmetries of the nodes' vector fields to induce a desired synchronization/consensus pattern, where nodes are clustered in different groups each converging towards a different synchronized evolution. We show that the new conditions we present offer a systematic methodology to design a distributed network controller able to drive a network of interest towards a desired synchronization/consensus pattern.

010       Forman curvature for complex networks
021       We adapt Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the case of undirected networks, both weighted and unweighted, and investigate the measure in a variety of model and real-world networks. 
020       We find that most nodes and edges in model and real networks have a negative curvature. Furthermore, the distribution of Forman curvature of nodes and edges is narrow in random and small-world networks, while the distribution is broad in scale-free and real-world networks. In most networks, Forman curvature is found to display significant negative correlation with degree and centrality measures. However, Forman curvature is uncorrelated with clustering coefficient in most networks. Importantly, we find that both model and real networks are vulnerable to targeted deletion of nodes with highly negative Forman curvature. Our results suggest that Forman curvature can be employed to gain novel insights on the organization of complex networks.

010       A Game-Theoretic Approach for Detection of Overlapping Communities in   Dynamic Complex Networks
021       Complex networks tend to display communities which are groups of nodes cohesively connected among themselves in one group and sparsely connected to the remainder of the network. 
020       Detecting such communities is an important computational problem, since it provides an insight into the functionality of networks. Further, investigating community structure in a dynamic network, where the network is subject to change, is even more challenging. This paper presents a game-theoretical technique for detecting community structures in dynamic as well as static complex networks. In our method, each node takes the role of a player that attempts to gain a higher payoff by joining one or more communities or switching between them. The goal of the game is to reveal community structure formed by these players by finding a Nash-equilibrium point among them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first game-theoretic algorithm which is able to extract overlapping communities from either static or dynamic networks. We present the experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world networks.

010       Network Unfolding Map by Edge Dynamics Modeling
021       The emergence of collective dynamics in neural networks is a mechanism of the animal and human brain for information processing. 
020       In this paper, we develop a computational technique of distributed processing elements, which are called particles. We observe the collective dynamics of particles in a complex network for transductive inference on semi-supervised learning problems. Three actions govern the particles' dynamics: walking, absorption, and generation. Labeled vertices generate new particles that compete against rival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the network until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently dominated by rival particles. The result from the model simulation consists of sets of edges sorted by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a connected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics of the model is a stochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version with largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with subquadratic growth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding map. Intuitively, edges "stretch" and "shrink" according to edge dynamics. Consequently, such effect summarizes the relevant relationships between vertices and uncovered data classes. The proposed model captures important details of connectivity patterns over the edge dynamics evolution, which contrasts with previous approaches focused on vertex dynamics. Computer simulations reveal that our model can identify nonlinear features in both real and artificial data, including boundaries between distinct classes and the overlapping structure of data.

010       Novel Dynamical Phenomena in Magnetic systems
021       Dynamics of Ising models is a much studied phenomenon and has emerged as a rich field of present-day research. 
020       An important dynamical feature commonly studied is the quenching phenomenon below the critical temperature. In this thesis we have studied the zero temperature quenching dynamics of different Ising spin systems. First we have studied the zero temperature quenching dynamics of two dimensional Ising spin system with competating interactions. Then we have studied the effect of randomness or disorder on the quenching dynamics of Ising spin system. We have studied the effect of the nature of randomness on zero temperature quenching dynamics of one dimensional Ising model on two type of complex networks. A model for opinion dynamics also has been proposed in this thesis, in which the binary opinions of the individuals are determined according to the size of their neighboring domains. This model can be equivalently defined in terms of Ising spin variables and the various quantities studied have one to one correspondence with magnetic systems. Introducing disorder in this model through a parameter called rigidity parameter $\rho$ (probability that people are completely rigid and never change their opinion), the transition to a heterogeneous society at $\rho = 0^{+}$ is obtained. The Model (Model I) has been generalized introducing a parameter named as size sensitivity parameter to modify the dynamics of the proposed model and a macroscopic crossover in time is observed for the intermediate values of this parameter.

010       Intervality and coherence in complex networks
021       Food webs -- networks of predators and prey -- have long been known to exhibit "intervality": species can generally be ordered along a single axis in such a way that the prey of any given predator tend to lie on unbroken compact intervals. 
020       Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a "niche" dimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the highly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic network modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value by hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the cause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of $46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\it predator} intervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous as the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not exclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites, cellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as interval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web assembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate significant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for food-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental structural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach to food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem assembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features thought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex networks.

010       Input graph: the hidden geometry in controlling complex networks
021       The ability to control a complex network towards a desired behavior relies on our understanding of the complex nature of these social and technological networks. 
020       The existence of numerous control schemes in a network promotes us to wonder: what is the underlying relationship of all possible input nodes? Here we introduce input graph, a simple geometry that reveals the complex relationship between all control schemes and input nodes. We prove that the node adjacent to an input node in the input graph will appear in another control scheme, and the connected nodes in input graph have the same type in control, which they are either all possible input nodes or not. Furthermore, we find that the giant components emerge in the input graphs of many real networks, which provides a clear topological explanation of bifurcation phenomenon emerging in dense networks and promotes us to design an efficient method to alter the node type in control. The findings provide an insight into control principles of complex networks and offer a general mechanism to design a suitable control scheme for different purposes.

010       Guitar Solos as Networks
021       This paper presents an approach to model melodies (and music pieces in general) as networks. 
020       Notes of a melody can be seen as nodes of a network that are connected whenever these are played in sequence. This creates a directed graph. By using complex network theory, it is possible to extract some main metrics, typical of networks, that characterize the piece. Using this framework, we provide an analysis on a set of guitar solos performed by main musicians. The results of this study indicate that this model can have an impact on multimedia applications such as music classification, identification, and automatic music generation.

010       &quot;Conjectural&quot; links in complex networks
021       This paper introduces the concept of Conjectural Link for Complex Networks, in particular, social networks. 
020       Conjectural Link we understand as an implicit link, not available in the network, but supposed to be present, based on the characteristics of its topology. It is possible, for example, when in the formal description of the network some connections are skipped due to errors, deliberately hidden or withdrawn (e.g. in the case of partial destruction of the network). Introduced a parameter that allows ranking the Conjectural Link. The more this parameter - the more likely that this connection should be present in the network. This paper presents a method of recovery of partially destroyed Complex Networks using Conjectural Links finding. Presented two methods of finding the node pairs that are not linked directly to one another, but have a great possibility of Conjectural Link communication among themselves: a method based on the determination of the resistance between two nodes, and method based on the computation of the lengths of routes between two nodes. Several examples of real networks are reviewed and performed a comparison to know network links prediction methods, not intended to find the missing links in already formed networks.

010       Improved Bounds on the Epidemic Threshold of Exact SIS Models on Complex   Networks
021       The SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic model on an arbitrary network, without making approximations, is a $2^n$-state Markov chain with a unique absorbing state (the all-healthy state). 
020       This makes analysis of the SIS model and, in particular, determining the threshold of epidemic spread quite challenging. It has been shown that the exact marginal probabilities of infection can be upper bounded by an $n$-dimensional linear time-invariant system, a consequence of which is that the Markov chain is "fast-mixing" when the LTI system is stable, i.e. when $\frac{\beta}{\delta}&lt;\frac{1}{\lambda_{\max}(A)}$ (where $\beta$ is the infection rate per link, $\delta$ is the recovery rate, and $\lambda_{\max}(A)$ is the largest eigenvalue of the network's adjacency matrix). This well-known threshold has been recently shown not to be tight in several cases, such as in a star network. In this paper, We provide tighter upper bounds on the exact marginal probabilities of infection, by also taking pairwise infection probabilities into account. Based on this improved bound, we derive tighter eigenvalue conditions that guarantee fast mixing (i.e., logarithmic mixing time) of the chain. We demonstrate the improvement of the threshold condition by comparing the new bound with the known one on various networks and epidemic parameters.

010       Growing networks of overlapping communities with internal structure
021       We introduce an intuitive model that describes both the emergence of community structure and the evolution of the internal structure of communities in growing social networks. 
020       The model comprises two complementary mechanisms: One mechanism accounts for the evolution of the internal link structure of a single community, and the second mechanism coordinates the growth of multiple overlapping communities. The first mechanism is based on the assumption that each node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the community at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism gives rise to an effective maximal degree within communities. This observation is related to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's number, i.e., the empirical observation of a maximal number of ties which an average individual can sustain within its social groups. The second mechanism is based on a recently proposed generalization of preferential attachment to community structure, appropriately called structural preferential attachment (SPA). The combination of these two mechanisms into a single model (SPA+) allows us to reproduce a number of the global statistics of real networks: The distribution of community sizes, of node memberships and of degrees. The SPA+ model also predicts (a) three qualitative regimes for the degree distribution within overlapping communities and (b) strong correlations between the number of communities to which a node belongs and its number of connections within each community. We present empirical evidence that support our findings in real complex networks.

010       Unveiling causal activity of complex networks
021       We introduce a novel tool for analyzing complex network dynamics, allowing for cascades of causally-related events, which we call causal webs (c-webs), to be separated from other non-causally-related events. 
020       This tool shows that traditionally-conceived avalanches may contain mixtures of spatially-distinct but temporally-overlapping cascades of events, and dynamical disorder or noise. In contrast, c-webs separate these components, unveiling previously hidden features of the network and dynamics. We apply our method to mouse cortical data with resulting statistics which demonstrate for the first time that neuronal avalanches are not merely composed of causally-related events.

010       The role of SiO as a tracer of past star-formation events: The case of   the high-mass protocluster NGC 2264-C
021       NGC 2264-C is a high-mass protocluster where several star-formation events are known to have occurred. 
020       To investigate whether past protostellar activity has left a chemical imprint in this region, we mapped it in SiO($J = 2-1$), a shock tracer, and several other molecular lines with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. Our observations show the presence of a complex network of protostellar outflows. The strongest SiO emission lies beyond a radius of $\sim 0.1$ pc with respect to the center of the clump, and is characterized by broad ($&gt; 10$ km s$^{-1}$) lines and abundances of $\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ with respect to H$_2$. Interestingly, SiO appears relatively depleted ($\chi_\mathrm{SiO} \sim 4 \times 10^{-9}$) within this radius, despite it being affected by molecular outflow activity. We attribute this to fast condensation of SiO back onto dust grains and/or rapid gas-phase destruction of SiO, favored by the high density present in this area ($&gt; 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$). Finally, we identify a peripheral, narrow-line ($\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$) component, where SiO has an abundance of a few times 10$^{-11}$. After considering different options, we conclude that this weak emission may be tracing protostellar shocks from the star formation episode that preceded the current one, which have decelerated over time and eventually resulted in SiO being largely depleted/destroyed. Alternatively, a population of unresolved low-mass protostars may be responsible for the narrow SiO emission. High-angular resolution observations are necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities and thus understand the role of SiO as a chemical tracer of past star-formation episodes in massive protoclusters.

010       Disentangling regular and chaotic motion in the standard map using   complex network analysis of recurrences in phase space
021       Recurrence in the phase space of complex systems is a well-studied phenomenon, which has provided deep insights into the nonlinear dynamics of such systems. 
020       For dissipative systems, characteristics based on recurrence plots have recently attracted much interest for discriminating qualitatively different types of dynamics in terms of measures of complexity, dynamical invariants, or even structural characteristics of the underlying attractor's geometry in phase space. Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also provides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical regimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional conservative system. Specifically, we show that the recently developed approach of recurrence network analysis provides potentially useful geometric characteristics distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. We find that chaotic orbits in an intermittent laminar phase (commonly referred to as sticky orbits) have a distinct geometric structure possibly differing in a subtle way from those of regular orbits, which is highlighted by different recurrence network properties obtained from relatively short time series. Thus, this approach can help discriminating regular orbits from laminar phases of chaotic ones, which presents a persistent challenge to many existing chaos detection techniques.

010       On noise-induced synchronization and consensus of nonlinear network   systems under input disturbances
021       This paper is concerned with the study of synchronization and consensus phenomena in complex networks of diffusively-coupled nodes subject to external disturbances. 
020       Specifically, we make use of stochastic Lyapunov functions to provide conditions for synchronization and consensus for networks of nonlinear, diffusively coupled nodes, where noise diffusion is not just additive but it depends on the nodes' state. The sufficient condition we provide, wich links together network topology, coupling strength and noise diffusion, offers two interesting interpretations. First, as suggested by {\em intuition}, in order for a network to achieve synchronization/consensus, its nodes need to be sufficiently well connected together. The second implication might seem, instead, counter-intuitive: if noise diffusion is {\em properly} designed, then it can drive an unsynchronized network towards synchronization/consensus. Motivated by our current research in Smart Cities and Internet of Things, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing how our results can be used to control certain collective decision processes.

010       Characterising brain network topologies: a dynamic analysis approach   using heat kernels
021       Network theory provides a principled abstraction of the human brain: reducing a complex system into a simpler representation from which to investigate brain organisation. 
020       Recent advancement in the neuroimaging field are towards representing brain connectivity as a dynamic process in order to gain a deeper understanding of how the brain is organised for information transport. In this paper we propose a network modelling approach based on the heat kernel to capture the process of heat diffusion in complex networks. By applying the heat kernel to structural brain networks, we define new features which quantify change in energy flow. Identifying suitable features which can classify networks between cohorts is useful towards understanding the effect of disease on brain architecture. We demonstrate the discriminative power of heat kernel features in both synthetic and clinical preterm data. By generating an extensive range of synthetic networks with varying density and randomisation, we investigate how heat flows in the networks in relation to changes in network topology. We demonstrate that our proposed features provide a metric of network efficiency and may be indicative of organisational principles commonly associated with, for example, small-world architecture. In addition, we show the potential of these features to characterise and classify between network topologies. We further demonstrate our methodology in a clinical setting by applying it to a large cohort of preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age from which diffusion networks were computed. We show that our heat kernel features are able to successfully predict motor function measured at two years of age (sensitivity, specificity, F-score, accuracy = 75.0, 82.5, 78.6, 82.3%, respectively.

010       Pattern formation in a two-component reaction-diffusion system with   delayed processes on a network
021       Reaction-diffusion systems with time-delay defined on complex networks have been studied in the framework of the emergence of Turing instabilities. 
020       The use of the Lambert W-function allowed us get explicit analytic conditions for the onset of patterns as a function of the main involved parameters, the time-delay, the network topology and the diffusion coefficients. Depending on these parameters, the analysis predicts whether the system will evolve towards a stationary Turing pattern or rather to a wave pattern associated to a Hopf bifurcation. The possible outcomes of the linear analysis overcome the respective limitations of the single-species case with delay, and that of the classical activator-inhibitor variant without delay. Numerical results gained from the Mimura-Murray model support the theoretical approach.

010       Cascading failures in interdependent networks with finite functional   components
021       We present a cascading failure model of two interdependent networks in which functional nodes belong to components of size greater than or equal to $s$. 
020       We find theoretically and via simulation that in complex networks with random dependency links the transition is first-order for $s\geq 3$ and second-order for $s=2$. We find for two square lattices with a distance constraint $r$ in the dependency links that increasing $r$ moves the system from a regime without a phase transition to one with a second-order transition. As $r$ continues to increase the system collapses in a first-order transition. Each regime is associated with a different structure of domain formation of functional nodes.

010       Time Is of the Essence: Analyzing the Effect of Vertex-Joining Time on   Complex Network Evolution
021       Complex networks have non-trivial characteristics and appear in many real-world systems. 
020       Such networks are vitally important, but their full underlying dynamics are not completely understood. Utilizing new data sources, however, can unveil the evolution process of these networks. <br />This study uses the recently published Reddit dataset, containing over 1.65 billion comments, to construct the largest publicly available social network corpus to date. We used this dataset to deeply examine the network evolution process, which resulted in two key observations: First, links are more likely to be created among users who join a network at a similar time. Second, the rate in which new users join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; i.e., different user-join patterns create different topological properties. <br />Based on these observations, we developed the \textit{Temporal Preferential Attachment} random network generation model. This model produces not only scale-free networks that have relative high clustering coefficients, but also networks that are sensitive to both the rate and the time in which users join the network. This results in a more accurate and flexible model of how complex networks evolve, one which more closely represents real-world data.

010       Energy Scaling of Targeted Optimal Control of Complex Networks
021       Recently it has been shown that the control energy required to control a dynamical complex network is prohibitively large when there are only a few control inputs. 
020       Most methods to reduce the control energy have focused on where, in the network, to place additional control inputs. Here, in contrast, we show that by controlling the states of a subset of the nodes of a network, rather than the state of every node, while holding the number of control signals constant, the required energy to control a portion of the network can be reduced substantially. The energy requirements exponentially decay with the number of target nodes, suggesting that large networks can be controlled by a relatively small number of inputs as long as the target set is appropriately sized. We validate our conclusions in model and real networks to arrive at an energy scaling law to better design control objectives regardless of system size, energy restrictions, state restrictions, input node choices and target node choices.

021       Studying models of cyber epidemics over arbitrary complex networks can deepen our understanding of cyber security from a whole-system perspective. 
020       In this paper, we initiate the investigation of cyber epidemic models that accommodate the {\em dependences} between the cyber attack events. Due to the notorious difficulty in dealing with such dependences, essentially all existing cyber epidemic models have assumed them away. Specifically, we introduce the idea of Copulas into cyber epidemic models for accommodating the dependences between the cyber attack events. We investigate the epidemic equilibrium thresholds as well as the bounds for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium infection probabilities. We further characterize the side-effects of assuming away the due dependences between the cyber attack events, by showing that the results thereof are unnecessarily restrictive or even incorrect.

010       Benchmarking Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Complex Network Analysis
021       We lay the foundation for a benchmarking methodology for assessing current and future quantum computers. 
020       We pose and begin addressing fundamental questions about how to fairly compare computational devices at vastly different stages of technological maturity. We critically evaluate and offer our own contributions to current quantum benchmarking efforts, in particular those involving adiabatic quantum computation and the Adiabatic Quantum Optimizers produced by D-Wave Systems, Inc. We find that the performance of D-Wave's Adiabatic Quantum Optimizers scales roughly on par with classical approaches for some hard combinatorial optimization problems; however, architectural limitations of D-Wave devices present a significant hurdle in evaluating real-world applications. In addition to identifying and isolating such limitations, we develop algorithmic tools for circumventing these limitations on future D-Wave devices, assuming they continue to grow and mature at an exponential rate for the next several years.

010       Opinion dynamics over complex networks: kinetic modeling and numerical   methods
021       In this paper we consider the modeling of opinion dynamics over time dependent large scale networks. 
020       A kinetic description of the agents' distribution over the evolving network is considered which combines an opinion update based on binary interactions between agents with a dynamic creation and removal process of new connections. The number of connections of each agent influences the spreading of opinions in the network but also the way connections are created is influenced by the agents' opinion. The evolution of the network of connections is studied by showing that its asymptotic behavior is consistent both with Poisson distributions and truncated power-laws. In order to study the large time behavior of the opinion dynamics a mean field description is derived which allows to compute exact stationary solutions in some simplified situations. Numerical methods which are capable to describe correctly the large time behavior of the system are also introduced and discussed. Finally, several numerical examples showing the influence of the agents' number of connections in the opinion dynamics are reported.

021       Discovering communities in complex networks helps to understand the behaviour of the network. 
020       Some works in this promising research area exist, but communities uncovering in time-dependent and/or multiplex networks has not deeply investigated yet. In this paper, we propose a communities detection approach for multislice networks based on modularity optimization. We first present a method to reduce the network size that still preserves modularity. Then we introduce an algorithm that approximates modularity optimization (as usually adopted) for multislice networks, thus finding communities. The network size reduction allows us to maintain acceptable performances without affecting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

010       Preferential Attachment Model with Degree Bound and its Application to   Key Predistribution in WSN
021       Preferential attachment models have been widely studied in complex networks, because they can explain the formation of many networks like social networks, citation networks, power grids, and biological networks, to name a few. 
020       Motivated by the application of key predistribution in wireless sensor networks (WSN), we initiate the study of preferential attachment with degree bound. <br />Our paper has two important contributions to two different areas. The first is a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential attachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal preferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law, with many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme, the nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\max}$, where $d_{\max}$ is an integer chosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless sensor networks. We propose a new key predistribution scheme based on the above model. The important features of this model are that the network is fully connected, it has fewer keys, has larger size of the giant component and lower average path length compared with traditional key predistribution schemes and comparable resilience to random node attacks. <br />We argue that in many networks like key predistribution and Internet of Things, having nodes of very high degree will be a bottle-neck in communication. Thus, studying preferential attachment model with degree bound will open up new directions in the study of complex networks, and will have many applications in real world scenarios.

010       On Equivalence of Likelihood Maximization of Stochastic Block Model and   Constrained Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
021       Community structures detection in complex network is important for understanding not only the topological structures of the network, but also the functions of it. 
020       Stochastic block model and nonnegative matrix factorization are two widely used methods for community detection, which are proposed from different perspectives. In this paper, the relations between them are studied. The logarithm of likelihood function for stochastic block model can be reformulated under the framework of nonnegative matrix factorization. Besides the model equivalence, the algorithms employed by the two methods are different. Preliminary numerical experiments are carried out to compare the behaviors of the algorithms.

010       An Axiomatic and an Average-Case Analysis of Algorithms and Heuristics   for Metric Properties of Graphs
021       In recent years, researchers proposed several algorithms that compute metric quantities of real-world complex networks, and that are very efficient in practice, although there is no worst-case guarantee. 
020       <br />In this work, we propose an axiomatic framework to analyze the performances of these algorithms, by proving that they are efficient on the class of graphs satisfying certain axioms.

Furthermore, we prove that these properties are verified asymptotically almost surely by several probabilistic models that generate power law random graphs, such as the Configuration Model, the Chung-Lu model, and the Norros-Reittu model. Thus, our results imply average-case analyses in these models. <br />For example, in our framework, existing algorithms can compute the diameter and the radius of a graph in subquadratic time, and sometimes even in time $n^{1+o(1)}$. Moreover, in some regimes, it is possible to compute the $k$ most central vertices according to closeness centrality in subquadratic time, and to design a distance oracle with sublinear query time and subquadratic space occupancy. <br />In the worst case, it is impossible to obtain comparable results for any of these problems, unless widely-believed conjectures are false.

010       Distributed Resource Management in Systems of Systems: An Architecture   Perspective
021       This paper introduces a framework for studying the interactions of autonomous system components and the design of the connectivity structure in Systems of Systems (SoSs). 
020       This framework, which uses complex network models, is also used to study the connectivity structure's impact on resource management. We discuss resource sharing as a mechanism that adds a level of flexibility to distributed systems and describe the connectivity structures that enhance components' access to the resources available within the system. The framework introduced in this paper explicitly incorporates costs of connection and the benefits that are received by direct and indirect access to resources and provides measures of the optimality of connectivity structures. We discuss central and a distributed schemes that, respectively, represent systems in which a central planner determines the connectivity structure and systems in which distributed components are allowed to add and sever connections to improve their own resource access. Furthermore, we identify optimal connectivity structures for systems with various heterogeneity conditions.

010       Law of large numbers for the largest component in a hyperbolic model of   complex networks
021       We consider the component structure of a recent model of random graphs on the hyperbolic plane that was introduced by Krioukov et al. 
020       The model exhibits a power law degree sequence, small distances and clustering, features that are associated with the so-called complex networks. The model is controlled by two parameters $\alpha$ and $\nu$ where, roughly speaking, $\alpha$ controls the exponent of the power law and $\nu$ controls the average degree. Refining earlier results, we are able to show a law of large numbers for the largest component. That is, we show that the fraction of points in the largest component tends in probability to a constant $c$ that depends only on $\alpha,\nu$, while all other components are sublinear. We also study how $c$ depends on $\alpha, \nu$. To deduce our results, we introduce a local approximation of the random graph by a continuum percolation model on $\mathbb{R}^2$ that may be of independent interest.

010       GEMFsim: A Stochastic Simulator for the Generalized Epidemic Modeling   Framework
021       The recently proposed generalized epidemic modeling framework (GEMF) \cite{sahneh2013generalized} lays the groundwork for systematically constructing a broad spectrum of stochastic spreading processes over complex networks. 
020       This article builds an algorithm for exact, continuous-time numerical simulation of GEMF-based processes. Moreover the implementation of this algorithm, GEMFsim, is available in popular scientific programming platforms such as MATLAB, R, Python, and C; GEMFsim facilitates simulating stochastic spreading models that fit in GEMF framework. Using these simulations one can examine the accuracy of mean-field-type approximations that are commonly used for analytical study of spreading processes on complex networks.

010       Predicting the evolution of complex networks via local information
021       Almost all real-world networks are subject to constant evolution, and plenty of evolving networks have been investigated to uncover the underlying mechanisms for a deeper understanding of the organization and development of them. 
020       Compared with the rapid expansion of the empirical studies about evolution mechanisms exploration, the future links prediction methods corresponding to the evolution mechanisms are deficient. Real-world information always contain hints of what would happen next, which is also the case in the observed evolving networks. In this paper, we firstly propose a structured-dependent index to strengthen the robustness of link prediction methods. Then we treat the observed links and their timestamps in evolving networks as known information. We envision evolving networks as dynamic systems and model the evolutionary dynamics of nodes similarity. Based on the iterative updating of nodes' network position, the potential trend of evolving networks is uncovered, which improves the accuracy of future links prediction. Experiments on various real-world networks show that the proposed index performs better than baseline methods and the spatial-temporal position drift model performs well in real-world evolving networks.

010       Evoking complex neuronal networks by stimulating a single neuron
021       The dynamical responses of complex neuronal networks to external stimulus injected on a \emph{single} neuron are investigated. 
020       Stimulating the largest-degree neuron in the network, it is found that as the intensity of the stimulus increases, the network will be transiting from the resting to firing states and then restoring to the resting state, showing a bounded firing region in the parameter space. Furthermore, it is found that as the coupling strength decreases, the firing region is gradually expanded and, at the weak couplings, separated into disconnected subregions. By a simplified network model, we conduct a detail analysis on the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by stimulating intensity and coupling strength, and, by introducing a new coefficient named effective stimulus, explore the mechanisms of the modified firing region. It is revealed that the coupling strength and stimulating intensity are equally important in evoking the network, but with different mechanisms. Specifically, the effective stimuli are \emph{shifted up} globally with the increase of the stimulating intensity, while are \emph{drawn closer} with the increase of the coupling strength. The dynamical responses of small-world and random complex networks to external stimulus injected on the largest-degree neuron are also investigated, which confirm the generality of the observed phenomena.

010       Multifractal cross-correlation effects in two-variable time series of   complex network vertex observables
021       We investigate the scaling of the cross-correlations calculated for two-variable time series containing vertex properties in the context of complex networks. 
020       Time series of such observables are obtained by means of stationary, unbiased random walks. We consider three vertex properties that provide, respectively, short, medium, and long-range information regarding the topological role of vertices in a given network. In order to reveal the relation between these quantities, we applied the multifractal cross-correlation analysis technique, which provides information about the nonlinear effects in coupling of time series. We show that the considered network models are characterized by unique multifractal properties of the cross-correlation. In particular, it is possible to distinguish between Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi, Barab\'{a}si-Albert, and Watts-Strogatz networks on the basis of fractal cross-correlation. Moreover, the analysis of protein contact networks reveals characteristics shared with both scale-free and small-world models.

010       Behavior of Self-Motivated Agents in Complex Networks
021       Traditional evolutionary game theory describes how certain strategy spreads throughout the system where individual player imitates the most successful strategy among its neighborhood. 
020       Accordingly, player doesn't have own authority to change their state. However in the human society, peoples do not just follow strategies of other people, they choose their own strategy. In order to see the decision of each agent in timely basis and differentiate between network structures, we conducted multi-agent based modeling and simulation. In this paper, agent can decide its own strategy by payoff comparison and we name this agent as "Self-motivated agent". To explain the behavior of self-motivated agent, prisoner's dilemma game with cooperator, defector, loner and punisher are considered as an illustrative example. We performed simulation by differentiating participation rate, mutation rate and the degree of network, and found the special coexisting conditions.

010       Collective influence in evolutionary social dilemmas
021       When evolutionary games are contested in structured populations, the degree of each player in the network plays an important role. 
020       If they exist, hubs often determine the fate of the population in remarkable ways. Recent research based on optimal percolation in random networks has shown, however, that the degree is neither the sole nor the best predictor of influence in complex networks. Low-degree nodes may also be optimal influencers if they are hierarchically linked to hubs. Taking this into account leads to the formalism of collective influence in complex networks, which as we show here, has far-reaching implications for the favorable resolution of social dilemmas. In particular, there exists an optimal hierarchical depth for the determination of collective influence that we use to describe the potency of players for passing their strategies, which depends on the strength of the social dilemma. Interestingly, the degree, which corresponds to the baseline depth zero, is optimal only when the temptation to defect is small. Our research reveals that evolutionary success stories are related to spreading processes which are rooted in favorable hierarchical structures that extend beyond local neighborhoods.

010       Correlation networks from flows. The case of forced and time-dependent   advection-diffusion dynamics
021       Complex network theory provides an elegant and powerful framework to statistically investigate different types of systems such as society, brain or the structure of local and long-range dynamical interrelationships in the climate system. 
020       Network links in climate networks typically imply information, mass or energy exchange. However, the specific connection between oceanic or atmospheric flows and the climate network's structure is still unclear. We propose a theoretical approach for verifying relations between the correlation matrix and the climate network measures, generalizing previous studies and overcoming the restriction to stationary flows. Our methods are developed for correlations of a scalar quantity (temperature, for example) which satisfies an advection-diffusion dynamics in the presence of forcing and dissipation. Our approach reveals that correlation networks are not sensitive to steady sources and sinks and the profound impact of the signal decay rate on the network topology. We illustrate our results with calculations of degree and clustering for a meandering flow resembling a geophysical ocean jet.

020       The WS model with neighborhood size $k$ and rewiring probability probability $\beta$ can be viewed as a continuous interpolation between a deterministic ring lattice graph and the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph. We study both the computational and statistical aspects of detecting the deterministic ring lattice structure (or local geographical links, strong ties) in the presence of random connections (or long range links, weak ties), and for its recovery. The phase diagram in terms of $(k,\beta)$ is partitioned into several regions according to the difficulty of the problem. We propose distinct methods for the various regions.

Furthermore we adapt the classical Ricci flow that already proved to be a powerful tool in image processing and graphics, to the case of undirected and weighted networks. The application of the proposed method on peer-to-peer networks yields insights into topological properties and the structure of their underlying data.

010       Dependence of GAMA galaxy halo masses on the cosmic web environment from   100 square degrees of KiDS weak lensing data
021       Galaxies and their dark matter haloes are part of a complex network of mass structures, collectively called the cosmic web. 
020       Using the tidal tensor prescription these structures can be classified into four cosmic environments: voids, sheets, filaments and knots. As the cosmic web may influence the formation and evolution of dark matter haloes and the galaxies they host, we aim to study the effect of these cosmic environments on the average mass of galactic haloes. To this end we measure the galaxy-galaxy lensing profile of 91,195 galaxies, within 0.039 &lt; z &lt; 0.263, from the spectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, using ~100 square degrees of overlapping data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). In each of the four cosmic environments we model the contributions from group centrals, satellites and neighbouring groups to the stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles. After correcting the lens samples for differences in the stellar mass distribution, we find no dependence of the average halo mass of central galaxies on their cosmic environment. We do find a significant increase in the average contribution of neighbouring groups to the lensing profile in increasingly dense cosmic environments. We show, however, that the observed effect can be entirely attributed to the galaxy density at much smaller scales (within 4 Mpc/h), which is correlated with the density of the cosmic environments. Within our current uncertainties we find no direct dependence of galaxy halo mass on their cosmic environment.

010       Shock finding on a moving-mesh: II. Hydrodynamic shocks in the Illustris   universe
021       Hydrodynamical shocks are a manifestation of the non-linearity of the Euler equations and play a fundamental role in cosmological gas dynamics. 
020       In this work, we identify and analyse shocks in the Illustris simulation, and contrast the results with those of non-radiative runs. We show that simulations with more comprehensive physical models of galaxy formation pose new challenges for shock finding algorithms due to radiative cooling and star-forming processes, prompting us to develop a number of methodology improvements. We find in Illustris a total shock surface area which is about 1.4 times larger at the present epoch compared to non-radiative runs, and an energy dissipation rate at shocks which is higher by a factor of around 7. Remarkably, shocks with Mach numbers above and below $\mathcal{M}\approx10$ contribute about equally to the total dissipation across cosmic time. This is in sharp contrast to non-radiative simulations, and we demonstrate that a large part of the difference arises due to strong black hole radio-mode feedback in Illustris. We also provide an overview of the large diversity of shock morphologies, which includes complex networks of halo-internal shocks, shocks on to cosmic sheets, feedback shocks due to black holes and galactic winds, as well as ubiquitous accretion shocks. In high redshift systems more massive than $10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ we discover the existence of a double accretion shock pattern in haloes. They are created when gas streams along filaments without being shocked at the outer accretion shock, but then forms a second, roughly spherical accretion shock further inside.

010       A model to identify urban traffic congestion hotspots in complex   networks
021       Traffic congestion is one of the most notable problems arising in worldwide urban areas, importantly compromising human mobility and air quality. 
020       Current technologies to sense real-time data about cities, and its open distribution for analysis, allow the advent of new approaches for improvement and control. Here, we propose an idealized model, the Microscopic Congestion Model, based on the critical phenomena arising in complex networks, that allows to analytically predict congestion hotspots in urban environments. Results on real cities' road networks, considering, in some experiments, real-traffic data, show that the proposed model is capable of identifying susceptible junctions that might become hotspots if mobility demand increases.

010       Evaluating the effect of topic consideration in identifying communities   of rating-based social networks
021       Finding meaningful communities in social network has attracted the attentions of many researchers. 
020       The community structure of complex networks reveals both their organization and hidden relations among their constituents. Most of the researches in the field of community detection mainly focus on the topological structure of the network without performing any content analysis. Nowadays, real world social networks are containing a vast range of information including shared objects, comments, following information, etc. In recent years, a number of researches have proposed approaches which consider both the contents that are interchanged in the networks and the topological structures of the networks in order to find more meaningful communities. In this research, the effect of topic analysis in finding more meaningful communities in social networking sites in which the users express their feelings toward different objects (like movies) by the means of rating is demonstrated by performing extensive experiments.

010       KADABRA is an ADaptive Algorithm for Betweenness via Random   Approximation
021       We present KADABRA, a new algorithm to approximate betweenness centrality in directed and undirected graphs, which significantly outperforms all previous approaches on real-world complex networks. 
020       The efficiency of the new algorithm relies on two new theoretical contributions, of independent interest. The first contribution focuses on sampling shortest paths, a subroutine used by most algorithms that approximate betweenness centrality. We show that, on realistic random graph models, we can perform this task in time $|E|^{\frac{1}{2}+o(1)}$ with high probability, obtaining a significant speedup with respect to the $\Theta(|E|)$ worst-case performance. We experimentally show that this new technique achieves similar speedups on real-world complex networks, as well. The second contribution is a new rigorous application of the adaptive sampling technique. This approach decreases the total number of shortest paths that need to be sampled to compute all betweenness centralities with a given absolute error, and it also handles more general problems, such as computing the $k$ most central nodes. Furthermore, our analysis is general, and it might be extended to other settings.

010       A Fast Sampling Method of Exploring Graphlet Degrees of Large Directed   and Undirected Graphs
021       Exploring small connected and induced subgraph patterns (CIS patterns, or graphlets) has recently attracted considerable attention. 
020       Despite recent efforts on computing the number of instances a specific graphlet appears in a large graph (i.e., the total number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet), little attention has been paid to characterizing a node's graphlet degree, i.e., the number of CISes isomorphic to the graphlet that include the node, which is an important metric for analyzing complex networks such as social and biological networks. Similar to global graphlet counting, it is challenging to compute node graphlet degrees for a large graph due to the combinatorial nature of the problem. Unfortunately, previous methods of computing global graphlet counts are not suited to solve this problem. In this paper we propose sampling methods to estimate node graphlet degrees for undirected and directed graphs, and analyze the error of our estimates. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study this problem and give a fast scalable solution. We conduct experiments on a variety of real-word datasets that demonstrate that our methods accurately and efficiently estimate node graphlet degrees for graphs with millions of edges.

010       I/O-Efficient Generation of Massive Graphs Following the LFR Benchmark
021       LFR is a popular benchmark graph generator used to evaluate community detection algorithms. 
020       We present EM-LFR, the first external memory algorithm able to generate massive complex networks following the LFR benchmark. Its most expensive component is the generation of random graphs with prescribed degree sequences which can be divided into two steps: the graphs are first materialized deterministically using the Havel-Hakimi algorithm, and then randomized. Our main contributions are EM-HH and EM-ES, two I/O-efficient external memory algorithms for these two steps. We also propose EM-CM/ES, an alternative sampling scheme using the Configuration Model and rewiring steps to obtain a random simple graph. In an experimental evaluation we demonstrate their performance; our implementation is able to handle graphs with more than 37 billion edges on a single machine, is competitive with a massive parallel distributed algorithm, and is faster than a state-of-the-art internal memory implementation even on instances fitting in main memory. EM-LFR's implementation is capable of generating large graph instances orders of magnitude faster than the original implementation. We give evidence that both implementations yield graphs with matching properties by applying clustering algorithms to generated instances. Similarly, we analyse the evolution of graph properties as EM-ES is executed on networks obtained with EM-CM/ES and find that the alternative approach can accelerate the sampling process.

010       Simulated interaction of MHD shock waves with a complex network-like   region
021       We provide estimates of the wave energy reaching the solar chromosphere and corona in a network-like magnetic field topology, including a coronal null point. 
020       The waves are excited by an instantaneous strong subphotospheric source and propagate through the subphotosphere, photosphere, chromosphere, transition region, and corona with the plasma beta and other atmospheric parameters varying by several orders of magnitude. We compare two regimes of the wave propagation: a linear and nonlinear regime. While the amount of energy reaching the corona is similar in both regimes, this energy is transmitted at different frequencies. In both cases the dominant periods of waves at each height strongly depend on the local magnetic field topology, but this distribution is only in accordance with observations in the nonlinear case.

010       Combining complex networks and data mining: why and how
021       The increasing power of computer technology does not dispense with the need to extract meaningful in- formation out of data sets of ever growing size, and indeed typically exacerbates the complexity of this task. 
020       To tackle this general problem, two methods have emerged, at chronologically different times, that are now commonly used in the scientific community: data mining and complex network theory. Not only do complex network analysis and data mining share the same general goal, that of extracting information from complex systems to ultimately create a new compact quantifiable representation, but they also often address similar problems too. In the face of that, a surprisingly low number of researchers turn out to resort to both methodologies. One may then be tempted to conclude that these two fields are either largely redundant or totally antithetic. The starting point of this review is that this state of affairs should be put down to contingent rather than conceptual differences, and that these two fields can in fact advantageously be used in a synergistic manner. An overview of both fields is first provided, some fundamental concepts of which are illustrated. A variety of contexts in which complex network theory and data mining have been used in a synergistic manner are then presented. Contexts in which the appropriate integration of complex network metrics can lead to improved classification rates with respect to classical data mining algorithms and, conversely, contexts in which data mining can be used to tackle important issues in complex network theory applications are illustrated. Finally, ways to achieve a tighter integration between complex networks and data mining, and open lines of research are discussed.

010       Delocalized Epidemics on Graphs: A Maximum Entropy Approach
021       The susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) epidemic process on complex networks can show metastability, resembling an endemic equilibrium. 
020       In a general setting, the metastable state may involve a large portion of the network, or it can be localized on small subgraphs of the contact network. Localized infections are not interesting because a true outbreak concerns network--wide invasion of the contact graph rather than localized infection of certain sites within the contact network. Existing approaches to localization phenomenon suffer from a major drawback: they fully rely on the steady--state solution of mean--field approximate models in the neighborhood of their phase transition point, where their approximation accuracy is worst; as statistical physics tells us. We propose a dispersion entropy measure that quantifies the localization of infections in a generic contact graph. Formulating a maximum entropy problem, we find an upper bound for the dispersion entropy of the possible metastable state in the exact SIS process. As a result, we find sufficient conditions such that any initial infection over the network either dies out or reaches a localized metastable state. Unlike existing studies relying on the solution of mean--field approximate models, our investigation of epidemic localization is based on characteristics of exact SIS equations. Our proposed method offers a new paradigm in studying spreading processes over complex networks.

010       Generalized Method of Moments for Estimating Parameters of Stochastic   Reaction Networks
021       Discrete-state stochastic models have become a well-established approach to describe biochemical reaction networks that are influenced by the inherent randomness of cellular events. 
020       In the last years severalmethods for accurately approximating the statistical moments of such models have become very popular since they allow an efficient analysis of complex networks. We propose a generalized method of moments approach for inferring the parameters of reaction networks based on a sophisticated matching of the statistical moments of the corresponding stochastic model and the sample moments of population snapshot data. The proposed parameter estimation method exploits recently developed moment-based approximations and provides estimators with desirable statistical properties when a large number of samples is available. We demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the inference method on two case studies. The generalized method of moments provides accurate and fast estimations of unknown parameters of reaction networks. The accuracy increases when also moments of order higher than two are considered. In addition, the variance of the estimator decreases, when more samples are given or when higher order moments are included.

010       Comparing the diversity of information by word-of-mouth vs. web spread
021       Many studies have explored spreading and diffusion through complex networks. 
020       The following study examines a specific case of spreading of opinions in modern society through two spreading schemes, defined as being either through word-of-mouth (WOM), or through online search engines (WEB). We apply both modelling and real experimental results and compare the opinions people adopt through an exposure to their friend`s opinions, as opposed to the opinions they adopt when using a search engine based on the PageRank algorithm. A simulated study shows that when members in a population adopt decisions through the use of the WEB scheme, the population ends up with a few dominant views, while other views are barely expressed. In contrast, when members adopt decisions based on the WOM scheme, there is a far more diverse distribution of opinions in that population. The simulative results are further supported by an online experiment which finds that people searching information through a search engine end up with far more homogenous opinions as compared to those asking their friends.

010       Kernel-Based Structural Equation Models for Topology Identification of   Directed Networks
021       Structural equation models (SEMs) have been widely adopted for inference of causal interactions in complex networks. 
020       Recent examples include unveiling topologies of hidden causal networks over which processes such as spreading diseases, or rumors propagate. The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from their simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear dependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent to adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which account for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The advocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for nonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put forth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a convex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to proximal-splitting optimization methods. To this end, solvers with complementary merits are developed by leveraging the alternating direction method of multipliers, and proximal gradient iterations. Experiments conducted on simulated data demonstrate that the novel approach outperforms linear SEMs with respect to edge detection errors. Furthermore, tests on a real gene expression dataset unveil interesting new edges that were not revealed by linear SEMs, which could shed more light on regulatory behavior of human genes.

010       Multicore-periphery structure in networks
021       Many real-world networked systems exhibit a multicore-periphery structure, i.e., multiple cores, each of which contains densely connected elements, surrounded by sparsely connected elements that define the periphery. 
020       Identification of the multiple-periphery structure can provide a new handle on structures and functions of various complex networks, such as cognitive and biological networks, food webs, social networks, and communication and transportation networks. However, still no quantitative method exists to identify the multicore-periphery structure embedded in networks. Prior studies on core-periphery structure focused on either dichotomous or continuous division of a network into a single core and a periphery, whereas community detection algorithms did not discern the periphery from dense cohesive communities. Herein, we introduce a method to identify the optimal partition of a network into multiple dense cores and a loosely-connected periphery, and test the method on a well-known social network and the technology space network, which are best characterized by multiple-core structures. Our method gives precise and meaningful results. The analysis of multicore-periphery structure may advance our understandings of the structures and functions in diverse real-world networks.

010       Adapting the Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm for Enumerating Maximal Cliques in   Temporal Graphs
021       Dynamics of interactions play an increasingly important role in the analysis of complex networks. 
020       A modeling framework to capture this are temporal graphs which consist of a set of vertices (entities in the network) and a set of time-stamped binary interactions between the vertices. We focus on enumerating delta-cliques, an extension of the concept of cliques to temporal graphs: for a given time period delta, a delta-clique in a temporal graph is a set of vertices and a time interval such that all vertices interact with each other at least after every delta time steps within the time interval. Viard, Latapy, and Magnien [ASONAM 2015, TCS 2016] proposed a greedy algorithm for enumerating all maximal delta-cliques in temporal graphs. In contrast to this approach, we adapt the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm - an efficient, recursive backtracking algorithm which enumerates all maximal cliques in static graphs - to the temporal setting. We obtain encouraging results both in theory (concerning worst-case running time analysis based on the parameter "delta-slice degeneracy" of the underlying graph) as well as in practice with experiments on real-world data. The latter culminates in an improvement for most interesting delte-values concerning running time in comparison with the algorithm of Viard, Latapy, and Magnien.

010       A hybrid multiscale coarse-grained method for dynamics on complex   networks
021       Brute-force simulations for dynamics on very large networks are quite expensive. 
020       While phenomenological treatments may capture some macroscopic properties, they often ignore important microscopic details. Fortunately, one may be only interested in the property of local part and not in the whole network. Here, we propose a hybrid multiscale coarse-grained(HMCG) method which combines a fine Monte Carlo(MC) simulation on the part of nodes of interest with a more coarse Langevin dynamics on the rest part. We demonstrate the validity of our method by analyzing the equilibrium Ising model and the nonequilibrium susceptible-infected-susceptible model. It is found that HMCG not only works very well in reproducing the phase transitions and critical phenomena of the microscopic models, but also accelerates the evaluation of dynamics with significant computational savings compared to microscopic MC simulations directly for the whole networks. The proposed method is general and can be applied to a wide variety of networked systems just adopting appropriate microscopic simulation methods and coarse graining approaches.

010       Forman curvature for directed networks
021       A goal in network science is the geometrical characterization of complex networks. 
020       In this direction, we (<a href="/abs/1603.00386">arXiv:1603.00386</a>; J. Stat. Mech. (2016) P063206) have recently introduced the Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks. Investigation of Forman curvature in diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that this measure captures several aspects of the organization of complex undirected networks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed in nature, and the Forman curvature for undirected networks is unsuitable for analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we here extend the Forman curvature for undirected networks to the case of directed networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman curvature in directed networks elegantly incorporates node weights, edge weights and edge direction. By applying the Forman curvature for directed networks to a variety of model and real-world directed networks, we show that the measure can be used to characterize the structure of complex directed networks. Furthermore, our results also hold in real directed networks which are weighted or spatial in nature. These results in combination with our previous results suggest that the Forman curvature can be readily employed to study the organization of both directed and undirected complex networks.

010       Contagion on complex networks with persuasion
021       The threshold model has been widely adopted as a classic model for studying contagion processes on social networks. 
020       We consider asymmetric individual interactions in social networks and introduce a persuasion mechanism into the threshold model. Specifically, we study a combination of adoption and persuasion in cascading processes on complex networks. It is found that with the introduction of the persuasion mechanism, the system may become more vulnerable to global cascades, and the effects of persuasion tend to be more significant in heterogeneous networks than those in homogeneous networks: a comparison between heterogeneous and homogeneous networks shows that under weak persuasion, heterogeneous networks tend to be more robust against random shocks than homogeneous networks; whereas under strong persuasion, homogeneous networks are more stable. Finally, we study the effects of adoption and persuasion threshold heterogeneity on systemic stability. Though both heterogeneities give rise to global cascades, the adoption heterogeneity has an overwhelmingly stronger impact than the persuasion heterogeneity when the network connectivity is sufficiently dense.

010       Synchronization in the random field Kuramoto model on complex networks
021       We study the impact of random pinning fields on the emergence of synchrony in the Kuramoto model on complete graphs and uncorrelated random complex networks. 
020       We consider random fields with uniformly distributed directions and homogeneous and heterogeneous (Gaussian) field magnitude distribution. In our analysis we apply the Ott-Antonsen method and the annealed-network approximation to find the critical behavior of the order parameter. In the case of homogeneous fields, we find a tricritical point above which a second-order phase transition gives place to a first-order phase transition when the network is either fully connected, or scale-free with the degree exponent $\gamma&gt;5$. Interestingly, for scale-free networks with $2&lt;\gamma \leq 5$, the phase transition is of second-order at any field magnitude, except for degree distributions with $\gamma=3$ when the transition is of infinite order at $K_c=0$ independently on the random fields. Contrarily to the Ising model, even strong Gaussian random fields do not suppress the second-order phase transition in both complete graphs and scale-free networks though the fields increase the critical coupling for $\gamma &gt; 3$. Our simulations support these analytical results.

010       Orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix factorization under the   stochastic block model
021       We present a method based on the orthogonal symmetric non-negative matrix tri-factorization of the normalized Laplacian matrix for community detection in complex networks. 
020       While the exact factorization of a given order may not exist and is NP hard to compute, we obtain an approximate factorization by solving an optimization problem. We establish the connection of the factors obtained through the factorization to a non-negative basis of an invariant subspace of the estimated matrix, drawing parallel with the spectral clustering. Using such factorization for clustering in networks is motivated by analyzing a block-diagonal Laplacian matrix with the blocks representing the connected components of a graph. The method is shown to be consistent for community detection in graphs generated from the stochastic block model and the degree corrected stochastic block model. Simulation results and real data analysis show the effectiveness of these methods under a wide variety of situations, including sparse and highly heterogeneous graphs where the usual spectral clustering is known to fail. Our method also performs better than the state of the art in popular benchmark network datasets, e.g., the political web blogs and the karate club data.

010       Modeling Evolutionary Dynamics of Lurking in Social Networks
021       Lurking is a complex user-behavioral phenomenon that occurs in all large-scale online communities and social networks. 
020       It generally refers to the behavior characterizing users that benefit from the information produced by others in the community without actively contributing back to the production of social content. The amount and evolution of lurkers may strongly affect an online social environment, therefore understanding the lurking dynamics and identifying strategies to curb this trend are relevant problems. In this regard, we introduce the Lurker Game, i.e., a model for analyzing the transitions from a lurking to a non-lurking (i.e., active) user role, and vice versa, in terms of evolutionary game theory. We evaluate the proposed Lurker Game by arranging agents on complex networks and analyzing the system evolution, seeking relations between the network topology and the final equilibrium of the game. Results suggest that the Lurker Game is suitable to model the lurking dynamics, showing how the adoption of rewarding mechanisms combined with the modeling of hypothetical heterogeneity of users' interests may lead users in an online community towards a cooperative behavior.

010       $k$-core percolation on complex networks: Comparing random, localized   and targeted attacks
021       The type of malicious attack inflicting on networks greatly influences their stability under ordinary percolation in which a node fails when it becomes disconnected from the giant component. 
020       Here we study its generalization, $k$-core percolation, in which a node fails when it loses connection to a threshold $k$ number of neighbors. We study and compare analytically and by numerical simulations of $k$-core percolation the stability of networks under random attacks (RA), localized attacks (LA) and targeted attacks (TA), respectively. By mapping a network under LA or TA into an equivalent network under RA, we find that in both single and interdependent networks, TA exerts the greatest damage to the core structure of a network. We also find that for Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, LA and RA exert equal damage to the core structure whereas for scale-free (SF) networks, LA exerts much more damage than RA does to the core structure.

010       Measure for degree heterogeneity in complex networks and its application   to recurrence network analysis
021       We propose a novel measure of degree heterogeneity, for unweighted and undirected complex networks, which requires only the degree distribution of the network for its computation. 
020       We show that the proposed measure can be applied to all types of network topology with ease and increases with the diversity of node degrees in the network. The measure is applied to compute the heterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks with its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we introduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically with the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We numerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a function of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables. Finally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be used to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the time series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a single index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.

010       Leveraging percolation theory to single out influential spreaders in   networks
021       Among the consequences of the disordered interaction topology underlying many social, techno- logical and biological systems, a particularly important one is that some nodes, just because of their position in the network, may have a disproportionate effect on dynamical processes mediated by the complex interaction pattern. 
020       For example, the early adoption by an opinion leader in a social network may change the fate of a commercial product, or just a few super-spreaders may determine the virality of a meme in social media. Despite many recent efforts, the formulation of an accurate method to optimally identify influential nodes in complex network topologies remains an unsolved challenge. Here, we present the exact solution of the problem for the specific, but highly relevant, case of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model for epidemic spreading at criticality. By exploiting the mapping between bond percolation and the static properties of SIR, we prove that the recently introduced Non-Backtracking centrality is the optimal criterion for the identification of influential spreaders in locally tree-like networks at criticality. By means of simulations on synthetic networks and on a very extensive set of real-world networks, we show that the Non-Backtracking centrality is a highly reliable metric to identify top influential spreaders also in generic graphs not embedded in space, and for noncritical spreading.

010       Levy random walks on multiplex networks
021       Random walks constitute a fundamental mechanism for many dynamics taking place on complex networks. 
020       Besides, as a more realistic description of our society, multiplex networks have been receiving a growing interest, as well as the dynamical processes that occur on top of them. Here, inspired by one specific model of random walks that seems to be ubiquitous across many scientific fields, the Levy flight, we study a new navigation strategy on top of multiplex networks. Capitalizing on spectral graph and stochastic matrix theories, we derive analytical expressions for the mean first passage time and the average time to reach a node on these networks. Moreover, we also explore the efficiency of Levy random walks, which we found to be very different as compared to the single layer scenario, accounting for the structure and dynamics inherent to the multiplex network. Finally, by comparing with some other important random walk processes defined on multiplex networks, we find that in some region of the parameters, a Levy random walk is the most efficient strategy. Our results give us a deeper understanding of Levy random walks and show the importance of considering the topological structure of multiplex networks when trying to find efficient navigation strategies.

010       3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of protostellar collapse with   H-C-O dynamical chemistry
021       Combining the co-evolving chemistry, hydrodynamics and radiative transfer is an important step for star formation studies. 
020       It allows both a better link to observations and a self-consistent monitoring of the magnetic dissipation in the collapsing core. Our aim is to follow a chemo-dynamical evolution of collapsing dense cores with a reduced gas-grain chemical network. We present the results of radiative hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of 1 M$_\odot$ isolated dense core collapse. The physical setup includes RHD and dynamical evolution of a chemical network. To perform those simulations, we merged the multi-dimensional adaptive-mesh-refinement code RAMSES and the thermo-chemistry Paris-Durham shock code. We simulate the formation of the first hydro-static core (FHSC) and the co-evolution of 56 species describing mainly H-C-O chemistry. Accurate benchmarking is performed, testing the reduced chemical network against a well-establiched complex network. We show that by using a compact set of reactions, one can match closely the CO abundances with results of a much more complex network. Our main results are: (a) We find that gas-grain chemistry post-processing can lead to one order of magnitude lower CO gas-phase abundances compared to the dynamical chemistry, with strongest effect during the isothermal phase of collapse. (b) The free-fall time has little effect on the chemical abundances for our choice of the parameters. (c) Dynamical chemical evolution is required to describe the CO gas phase abundance as well as the CO ice formation for the mean grain size larger then 1$\mu{}$m. (d) Furthermore, dust mean size and size distribution have a strong effect on chemical abundances and hence on the ionization degree and magnetic dissipation. We conclude that dust grain growth in the collapse simulations can be as important as coupling the collapse with chemistry.

010       Structure-based control of complex networks with nonlinear dynamics
021       What can we learn about controlling a system solely from its underlying network structure? Here we adapt a recently developed framework for control of networks governed by a broad class of nonlinear dynamics that includes the major dynamic models of biological, technological, and social processes. 
020       This feedback-based framework provides realizable node overrides that steer a system towards any of its natural long term dynamic behaviors, regardless of the specific functional forms and system parameters. We use this framework on several real networks, identify the topological characteristics that underlie the predicted node overrides, and compare its predictions to those of structural controllability in control theory. Finally, we demonstrate this framework's applicability in dynamic models of gene regulatory networks and identify nodes whose override is necessary for control in the general case, but not in specific model instances.

010       Synchronization failure caused by interplay between noise and network   heterogeneity
021       We investigate synchronization in complex networks of noisy phase oscillators. 
020       We find that, while too weak a coupling is not sufficient for the whole system to synchronize, too strong a coupling induces a nontrivial type of phase slip among oscillators, resulting in synchronization failure. Thus, an intermediate coupling range for synchronization exists, which becomes narrower when the network is more heterogeneous. Analyses of two noisy oscillators reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present and coupling is strong. Therefore, the low synchronizability of heterogeneous networks can be understood as a result of the difference in effective coupling strength among oscillators with different degrees; oscillators with high degrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak coupling strengths that are insufficient for synchronization.

010       Feedback through graph motifs relates structure and function in complex   networks
021       How does the connectivity of a network system combine with the behavior of its individual components to determine its collective function? We approach this question by relating the internal network feedback to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of surprisingly simple and local statistics on the network topology. 
020       The resulting motif description provides a reduced order model of the network input-output dynamics and it relates the overall network function to feedback control theory. For example, this new formulation dramatically simplifies the classic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall graph behavior to a simple proportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. Higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types of feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity shapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show how this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time constant with which networks remember past signals. Rich connections between structure and function are developed for networks with random input and output weights, and those composed from nodes with distinct dynamics and connectivity. These simple statistical descriptions provide a powerful theoretical framework to understand the functionality of real-world network systems, as we illustrate for the mouse brain connectome.

010       Spatial Organization of the Cytoskeleton enhances Cargo Delivery to   Specific Target Areas on the Plasma Membrane of Spherical Cells
021       Intracellular transport is vital for the proper functioning and survival of a cell. 
020       Cargo (proteins, vesicles, organelles, etc.) is transferred from its place of creation to its target locations via molecular motor assisted transport along cytoskeletal filaments. The transport efficiency is strongly affected by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton, which constitutes an inhomogeneous, complex network. In cells with a centrosome microtubules grow radially from the central microtubule organizing center towards the cell periphery whereas actin filaments form a dense meshwork, the actin cortex, underneath the cell membrane with a broad range of orientations. The emerging ballistic motion along filaments is frequently interrupted due to constricting intersection nodes or cycles of detachment and reattachment processes in the crowded cytoplasm. In order to investigate the efficiency of search strategies established by the cell's specific spatial organization of the cytoskeleton we formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. With extensive computer simulations we analyze the dependence of the mean first passage times for narrow escape problems on the structural characteristics of the cytoskeleton, the motor properties and the fraction of time spent in each state. We find that an inhomogeneous architecture with a small width of the actin cortex constitutes an efficient intracellular search strategy.

010       Optimal Disruption of Complex Networks
021       The collection of all the strongly connected components in a directed graph, among each cluster of which any node has a path to another node, is a typical example of the intertwining structure and dynamics in complex networks, as its relative size indicates network cohesion and it also composes of all the feedback cycles in the network. 
020       Here we consider finding an optimal strategy with minimal effort in removal arcs (for example, deactivation of directed interactions) to fragment all the strongly connected components into tree structure with no effect from feedback mechanism. We map the optimal network disruption problem to the minimal feedback arc set problem, a non-deterministically polynomial hard combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory. We solve the problem with statistical physical methods from spin glass theory, resulting in a simple numerical method to extract sub-optimal disruption arc sets with significantly better results than a local heuristic method and a simulated annealing method both in random and real networks. Our results has various implications in controlling and manipulation of real interacted systems.

010       Sampling methods for the quasistationary regime of epidemic processes on   regular and complex networks
021       A major hurdle in the simulation of the steady state of epidemic processes is that the system will unavoidably visit an absorbing, disease-free state at sufficiently long times due to the finite size of the networks where epidemics evolves. 
020       In the present work, we compare different quasistationary (QS) simulation methods where the absorbing states are suitably handled and the thermodynamical limit of the original dynamics can be achieved. We analyze the standard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active configurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics returns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where the most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an absorbing state. We apply the methods to the contact process (CP) and susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models on regular and scale free networks. The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both models. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the methods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub mutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized epidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the auto-correlation time as a tool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis provides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation time for the investigated methods. Finally, we verify the equivalence between RBC method and a weak external field for epidemics on networks.

010       Onset of anomalous diffusion from local motion rules
021       Anomalous diffusion processes, in particular superdiffusive ones, are known to be efficient strategies for searching and navigation by animals and also in human mobility. 
020       One way to create such regimes are L\'evy flights, where the walkers are allowed to perform jumps, the "flights", that can eventually be very long as their length distribution is asymptotically power-law distributed. In our work, we present a model in which walkers are allowed to perform, on a 1D lattice, "cascades" of $n$ unitary steps instead of one jump of a randomly generated length, as in the L\'evy case, where $n$ is drawn from a cascade distribution $p_n$. We show that this local mechanism may give rise to superdiffusion or normal diffusion when $p_n$ is distributed as a power law. We also introduce waiting times that are power-law distributed as well and therefore the probability distribution scaling is steered by the two PDF's power-law exponents. As a perspective, our approach may engender a possible generalization of anomalous diffusion in context where distances are difficult to define, as in the case of complex networks, and also provide an interesting model for diffusion in temporal networks.

010       How the site degree influences quantum probability on inhomogeneous   substrates
021       We investigate the effect of the node degree and energy $E$ on the electronic wave function for regular and irregular structures, namely, regular lattices, disordered percolation clusters, and complex networks. 
020       We evaluate the dependence of the quantum probability for each site on its degree. For bi-regular structures, we prove analytically that the probability $P_k(E)$ of finding the particle on any site with $k$ neighbors is independent of $E$. For more general structures, the dependency of $P_k(E)$ on $E$ is discussed by taking into account exact results on a one-dimensional semi-regular chain: $P_k(E)$ is large for small values of $E$ when $k$ is also small, and its maximum values shift towards large values of $|E|$ with increasing $k$. Numerical evaluations of $P_k(E)$ for two different types of percolation clusters and the Apollonian network suggest that this feature might be generally valid

010       Design of artificial genetic regulatory networks with multiple delayed   adaptive responses
021       Genetic regulatory networks with adaptive responses are widely studied in biology. 
020       Usually, models consisting only of a few nodes have been considered. They present one input receptor for activation and one output node where the adaptive response is computed. In this work, we design genetic regulatory networks with many receptors and many output nodes able to produce delayed adaptive responses. This design is performed by using an evolutionary algorithm of mutations and selections that minimizes an error function defined by the adaptive response in signal shapes. We present several examples of network constructions with a predefined required set of adaptive delayed responses. We show that an output node can have different kinds of responses as a function of the activated receptor. Additionally, complex network structures are presented since processing nodes can be involved in several input-output pathways.

010       Leveraging Evolution Dynamics to Generate Benchmark Complex Networks   with Community Structures
021       The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the field of Complex Social Networks. 
020       Several network generation models have been extensively studied to develop an understanding of how real world networks evolve over time. Two important applications of these models are to study the evolution dynamics and processes that shape a network, and to generate benchmark networks with known community structures. Research has been conducted in both these directions, relatively independent of the other. This creates a disjunct between real world networks and the networks generated as benchmarks to study community detection algorithms. <br />In this paper, we propose to study both these application areas together. We introduce a network generation model which is based on evolution dynamics of real world networks and, it can generate networks with community structures that can be used as benchmark graphs. We study the behaviour of different community detection algorithms based on the proposed model and compare it with other models to generate benchmark graphs. Results suggest that the proposed model can generate networks which are not only structurally similar to real world networks but can be used to generate networks with varying community sizes and topologies.

010       Noise Response Data Reveal Novel Controllability Gramian for Nonlinear   Network Dynamics
021       Control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical networks, e.g., collective behavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a central problem in many scientific and engineering fields. 
020       For the linear version of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an important role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable by a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the controllability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs distribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental noise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated with randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This fact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract effectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In addition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between controllability and statistical mechanics.

010       Fluctuations of a surface relaxation model in interacting scale free   networks
021       Isolated complex networks have been studied deeply in the last decades due to the fact that many real systems can be modeled using these types of structures. 
020       However, it is well known that the behavior of a system not only depends on itself, but usually also depends on the dynamics of other structures. For this reason, interacting complex networks and the processes developed on them have been the focus of study of many researches in the last years. One of the most studied subjects in this type of structures is the Synchronization problem, which is important in a wide variety of processes in real systems. In this manuscript we study the synchronization of two interacting scale-free networks, in which each node has $ke$ dependency links with different nodes in the other network. We map the synchronization problem with an interface growth, by studying the fluctuations in the steady state of a scalar field defined in both networks. <br />We find that as $ke$ slightly increases from $ke=0$, there is a really significant decreasing in the fluctuations of the system. However, this considerable improvement takes place mainly for small values of $ke$, when the interaction between networks becomes stronger there is only a slight change in the fluctuations. We characterize how the dispersion of the scalar field depends on the internal degree, and we show that a combination between the decreasing of this dispersion and the integer nature of our growth model are the responsible for the behavior of the fluctuations with $ke$.

010       Permanence and Community Structure in Complex Networks
021       The goal of community detection algorithms is to identify densely-connected units within large networks. 
020       An implicit assumption is that all the constituent nodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are more important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been primarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding to what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most metrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These metrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In this paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not uniform. <br />The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the extent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its community, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss how permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution of communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the persistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen the community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a community, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading. <br />We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful communities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the networks more accurately than eight other popular community detection algorithms. Finally, we show that the communities obtained by this method are (i) less affected by the changes in vertex-ordering, and (ii) more resilient to resolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of values.

010       Coevolving complex networks in the model of social interactions
021       We analyze Axelrod's model of social interactions on coevolving complex networks. 
020       We introduce four extensions with different mechanisms of edge rewiring. The models are intended to catch two kinds of interactions - preferential attachment, which can be observed in scientists or actors collaborations, and local rewiring, which can be observed in friendship formation in everyday relations. Numerical simulations show that proposed dynamics can lead to the power-law distribution of nodes' degree and high value of the clustering coefficient, while still retaining the small-world effect in three models. All models are characterized by two phase transitions of a different nature. In case of local rewiring we obtain order-disorder discontinuous phase transition even in the thermodynamic limit, while in case of long-distance switching discontinuity disappears in the thermodynamic limit, leaving one continuous phase transition. In addition, we discover a new and universal characteristic of the second transition point - an abrupt increase of the clustering coefficient, due to formation of many small complete subgraphs inside the network.

010       Community Structure in Industrial SAT Instances
021       Modern SAT solvers have experienced a remarkable progress on solving industrial instances. 
020       Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure. <br />The research community on complex networks has developed techniques of analysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT community. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of industrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of explaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them. <br />In this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the community structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph with clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of its nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same community. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show that most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the contrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how this structure evolves by the effects of the execution of the SAT solver. We detect that new clauses learnt by the solver during the search contribute to destroy the original community structure of the formula. This partially explains the distinct performance of SAT solvers on random and industrial SAT instances.

010       WordNet2Vec: Corpora Agnostic Word Vectorization Method
021       A complex nature of big data resources demands new methods for structuring especially for textual content. 
020       WordNet is a good knowledge source for comprehensive abstraction of natural language as its good implementations exist for many languages. Since WordNet embeds natural language in the form of a complex network, a transformation mechanism WordNet2Vec is proposed in the paper. It creates vectors for each word from WordNet. These vectors encapsulate general position - role of a given word towards all other words in the natural language. Any list or set of such vectors contains knowledge about the context of its component within the whole language. Such word representation can be easily applied to many analytic tasks like classification or clustering. The usefulness of the WordNet2Vec method was demonstrated in sentiment analysis, i.e. classification with transfer learning for the real Amazon opinion textual dataset.

010       Failure-recovery model with competition between failures in complex   networks: a dynamical approach
021       Real systems are usually composed by units or nodes whose activity can be interrupted and restored intermittently due to complex interactions not only with the environment, but also with the same system. 
020       Majdand\v{z}i\'c $et\;al.$ [Nature Physics 10, 34 (2014)] proposed a model to study systems in which active nodes fail and recover spontaneously in a complex network and found that in the steady state the density of active nodes can exhibit an abrupt transition and hysteresis depending on the values of the parameters. Here we investigate a model of recovery-failure from a dynamical point of view. Using an effective degree approach we find that the systems can exhibit a temporal sharp decrease in the fraction of active nodes. Moreover we show that, depending on the values of the parameters, the fraction of active nodes has an oscillatory regime which we explain as a competition between different failure processes. We also find that in the non-oscillatory regime, the critical fraction of active nodes presents a discontinuous drop which can be related to a "targeted" k-core percolation process. Finally, using mean field equations we analyze the space of parameters at which hysteresis and oscillatory regimes can be found.

010       Evidential Label Propagation Algorithm for Graphs
021       Community detection has attracted considerable attention crossing many areas as it can be used for discovering the structure and features of complex networks. 
020       With the increasing size of social networks in real world, community detection approaches should be fast and accurate. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) is known to be one of the near-linear solutions and benefits of easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we extend the update rule and propagation criterion of LPA in the framework of belief functions. A new community detection approach, called Evidential Label Propagation (ELP), is proposed as an enhanced version of conventional LPA. The node influence is first defined to guide the propagation process. The plausibility is used to determine the domain label of each node. The update order of nodes is discussed to improve the robustness of the method. ELP algorithm will converge after the domain labels of all the nodes become unchanged. The mass assignments are calculated finally as memberships of nodes. The overlapping nodes and outliers can be detected simultaneously through the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ELP.

010       On the Role of Triadic Substructures in Complex Networks
021       In the course of the growth of the Internet and due to increasing availability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science has established itself as an own area of research. 
020       With quantitative scientists from computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from biology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network science serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major goals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological graph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from the same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure. However, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically implies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this gap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a general introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work devoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major challenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node subgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may participate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle, a novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic building blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs - subgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at random - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs. Finally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical processes acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs impose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a larger network structure.

010       Inducing Self-Organized Criticality in a network toy model by   neighborhood assortativity
021       Complex networks are a recent type of frameworks used to study complex systems with many interacting elements, such as Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). 
020       The network node's tendency to link to other nodes of similar type is characterized by assortative mixing. Real networks exhibit assortative mixing by vertex degree, however typical random network models, such as Erdos-Renyi or Barabasi-Albert, show no assortative arrangements. In this paper we introduce the neighborhood assortativity notion, as the tendency of a node to belong to a community (its neighborhood) showing an average property similar to its own. Imposing neighborhood assortative mixing by degree in a network toy model, SOC dynamics can be found. The long-range correlations resulting from the criticality have been characterized by means of fluctuation analysis and show an anticorrelation in the node's activity. The model contains only one parameter and its statistics plots for different values of the parameter can be collapsed into a single curve. The simplicity of the model allows performing numerical simulations and also to study analytically the statistics for a specific value of the parameter, making use of the Markov chains.

020       We have first estimated an Origin-Destination matrix of buses users from datasets about the ticket validation and GPS positioning of buses. Then we represent the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario and, in particular, applying community discovery techniques, to identify clusters that the service supply infrastructure has. Finally, from the superimposing of the flow of people represented in the OriginDestination matrix in the supply network, we exemplify how micro-interventions can be prospected by means of an example of the introduction of express routes.

010       Complex systems: features, similarity and connectivity
021       The increasing interest in complex networks research has been a consequence of several intrinsic features of this area, such as the generality of the approach to represent and model virtually any discrete system, and the incorporation of concepts and methods deriving from many areas, from statistical physics to sociology, which are often used in an independent way. 
020       Yet, for this same reason, it would be desirable to integrate these various aspects into a more coherent and organic framework, which would imply in several benefits normally allowed by the systematization in science, including the identification of new types of problems and the cross-fertilization between fields. More specifically, the identification of the main areas to which the concepts frequently used in complex networks can be applied paves the way to adopting and applying a larger set of concepts and methods deriving from those respective areas. Among the several areas that have been used in complex networks research, pattern recognition, optimization, linear algebra, and time series analysis seem to play a more basic and recurrent role. In the present manuscript, we propose a systematic way to integrate the concepts from these diverse areas regarding complex networks research. In order to do so, we start by grouping the multidisciplinary concepts into three main groups, namely features, similarity, and network connectivity. Then we show that several of the analysis and modeling approaches to complex networks can be thought as a composition of maps between these three groups, with emphasis on nine main types of mappings, which are presented and illustrated. Such a systematization of principles and approaches also provides an opportunity to review some of the most closely related works in the literature, which is also developed in this article.

010       Explosive spreading on complex networks: the role of synergy
021       In spite of the vast literature on spreading dynamics on complex networks, the role of local synergy, i.e., the interaction of elements that when combined produce a total effect greater than the sum of the individualelements, has been studied but only for irreversible spreading dynamics. 
020       Reversible spreading dynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local synergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process, in which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an infected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a number of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the synergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical results. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the strength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the steady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate exhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In fact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the invasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical understanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated hysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.

010       Effective information spreading based on local information in correlated   networks
021       Using network-based information to facilitate information spreading is an essential task for spreading dynamics in complex networks, which will benefit the promotion of technical innovations, healthy behaviors, new products, etc. 
020       Focusing on degree correlated networks, we propose a preferential contact strategy based on the local network structure and local informed density to promote the information spreading. During the spreading process, an informed node will preferentially select a contact target among its neighbors, basing on their degrees or local informed densities. By extensively implementing numerical simulations in synthetic and empirical networks, we find that when only consider the local structure information, the convergence time of information spreading will be remarkably reduced if low-degree neighbors are favored as contact targets. Meanwhile, the minimum convergence time depends non-monotonically on degree-degree correlation, and moderate correlation coefficients result in most efficient information spreading. Incorporating the informed density information into contact strategy, the convergence time of information spreading can be further reduced. Finally, we show that by using local informed density is more effective as compared with the global case.

010       Metastable Localization of Diseases in Complex Networks
021       We describe the phenomenon of localization in the epidemic SIS model on highly heterogeneous networks in which strongly connected nodes (hubs) play the role of centers of localization. 
020       We find that in this model the localized states below the epidemic threshold are metastable. The longevity and scale of the metastable outbreaks do not show a sharp localization transition, instead there is a smooth crossover from localized to delocalized states as we approach the epidemic threshold from below. Analyzing these long-lasting local outbreaks for a random regular graph with a hub, we show how this localization can be detected from the shape of the distribution of the number of infective nodes.

010       Equilibrium distributions in entropy driven balanced processes
021       For entropy driven balanced processes we obtain final states with Poisson, Bernoulli, negative binomial and P\'olya distributions. 
020       We apply this both for complex networks and particle production. For random networks we follow the evolution of the degree distribution, $P_n$, in a system where a node can activate $k$ fixed connections from $K$ possible partnerships among all nodes. The total number of connections, $N$, is also fixed. For particle physics problems $P_n$ is the probability of having $n$ particles (or other quanta) distributed among $k$ states (phase space cells) while altogether a fixed number of $N$ particles reside on $K$ states.

010       MeDICINE: Rapid Prototyping of Production-Ready Network Services in   Multi-PoP Environments
021       Virtualized network services consisting of multiple individual network functions are already today deployed across multiple sites, so called multi-PoP (points of presence) environ- ments. 
020       This allows to improve service performance by optimizing its placement in the network. But prototyping and testing of these complex distributed software systems becomes extremely challenging. The reason is that not only the network service as such has to be tested but also its integration with management and orchestration systems. Existing solutions, like simulators, basic network emulators, or local cloud testbeds, do not support all aspects of these tasks. To this end, we introduce MeDICINE, a novel NFV prototyping platform that is able to execute production-ready network func- tions, provided as software containers, in an emulated multi-PoP environment. These network functions can be controlled by any third-party management and orchestration system that connects to our platform through standard interfaces. Based on this, a developer can use our platform to prototype and test complex network services in a realistic environment running on his laptop.

010       Diffusion paths between product life-cycles in European phonographic   markets
021       We have investigated the product life-cycles of almost 17 000 hit singles performed on the 12 biggest national phonographic markets in Europe including: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. 
020       We have considered weekly singles charts from the last 50 years (1966-2015) in each country. We analyze the spread of hit singles popularity (chart topping) as an epidemiological process performed on various European countries. Popular hit singles are contagious from one country to another. Thus, we consider time delays between the initial hit single release and reaching the highest position on consecutive national singles charts. We create directed network of countries representing transitions of hit singles popularity between countries. It is obtained by simulating the most likely paths and picking up the most frequent links. A country of initial hit single release is considered as a source of infection. Our algorithm builds up spanning trees by attaching new nodes. The probability of attachment depends on: <br />1) new nodes immunity <br />2) infectivity of previous nodes from the tree. Thus we obtain network of popularity spread with a hub the UK, a bridge the Netherlands and outliers Italy and Spain. We have found a characteristic topology of hit singles popularity spread. The positive correlation between this network and geographic or cultural grid-map of Europe is also observed. However, the network of popularity spread has some typical properties of complex networks.

010       Neural networks with differentiable structure
021       While gradient descent has proven highly successful in learning connection weights for neural networks, the actual structure of these networks is usually determined by hand, or by other optimization algorithms. 
020       Here we describe a simple method to make network structure differentiable, and therefore accessible to gradient descent. We test this method on recurrent neural networks applied to simple sequence prediction problems. Starting with initial networks containing only one node, the method automatically builds networks that successfully solve the tasks. The number of nodes in the final network correlates with task difficulty. The method can dynamically increase network size in response to an abrupt complexification in the task; however, reduction in network size in response to task simplification is not evident for reasonable meta-parameters. The method does not penalize network performance for these test tasks: variable-size networks actually reach better performance than fixed-size networks of higher, lower or identical size. We conclude by discussing how this method could be applied to more complex networks, such as feedforward layered networks, or multiple-area networks of arbitrary shape.

010       Link Prediction via Matrix Completion
021       Inspired by practical importance of social networks, economic networks, biological networks and so on, studies on large and complex networks have attracted a surge of attentions in the recent years. 
020       Link prediction is a fundamental issue to understand the mechanisms by which new links are added to the networks. We introduce the method of robust principal component analysis (robust PCA) into link prediction, and estimate the missing entries of the adjacency matrix. On one hand, our algorithm is based on the sparsity and low rank property of the matrix, on the other hand, it also performs very well when the network is dense. This is because a relatively dense real network is also sparse in comparison to the complete graph. According to extensive experiments on real networks from disparate fields, when the target network is connected and sufficiently dense, whatever it is weighted or unweighted, our method is demonstrated to be very effective and with prediction accuracy being considerably improved comparing with many state-of-the-art algorithms.

010       A Numerical Approach to Stability of Multiclass Queueing Networks
021       Multiclass queueing networks (McQNs) provide a natural mathematical framework for modeling a wide range of stochastic systems, e.g., manufacturing lines, computer grids, and telecommunication systems. 
020       They differ from the classical Jacksonian network model in that the same (physical) item entering the system may require multiple service stages at the same station, with different service and routing characteristics. This distinguishing feature has a significant impact on the assessment of stability of such networks; more specifically, while for Jackson networks stability is equivalent to sub-criticality, for certain McQNs such an equivalence does not hold. As such, analytical stability conditions are not available in general and one needs to rely on numerical methods for assessing stability. We propose a numerical, simulation-based method for determining the stability region of a McQN with respect to its arrival rate(s). We exploit (stochastic) monotonicity of McQNs in order to design a stochastic search scheme in the parameter space; stability is then a monotone property and the stability region can be recovered from its boundary points, which can be evaluated via stochastic approximation schemes. Numerical experiments show that the monotonicity condition, which we prove for Jackson networks, carries over to all networks that we considered, including relatively complex networks for which the stability condition is not known. An extensive set of simulation experiments shows the effectiveness of our method.

010       Enhanced capital-asset pricing model for the reconstruction of bipartite   financial networks
021       Reconstructing patterns of interconnections from partial information is one of the most important issues in the statistical physics of complex networks. 
020       A paramount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and amplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by the interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate balance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single positions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches to reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically dense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover, reconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of bilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing bipartite networks of security holdings (\eg, investment portfolios). Here we propose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization, tailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the traditional {\em capital-asset pricing model} (CAPM) and allows to reproduce the correct topology of the network. We test this ECAPM method on a dataset, collected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of European institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our approach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed MECAPM both in reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to fire-sales spillovers. In general, ECAPM can be applied to the whole class of weighted bipartite networks described by the fitness model.

010       Word sense disambiguation via bipartite representation of complex   networks
021       In recent years, concepts and methods of complex networks have been employed to tackle the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task by representing words as nodes, which are connected if they are semantically similar. 
020       Despite the increasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use networks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on the attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In other words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly used in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations have probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and graphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible links between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite network model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing the context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written texts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of words, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the proposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also constructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished. Our results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite networks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed to characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the support vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of being robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the results obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification method might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written texts.

010       Quantum synchronization and quantum state sharing in irregular complex   network
021       We investigate quantum synchronization phenomenon within the complex network constituted by coupled optomechanical systems and prove the unknown identical quantum states can be shared or distributed in the quantum network even though the topology is varying. 
020       Considering a channel constructed by quantum correlation, we show that quantum synchronization can sustain and maintain high levels in Markovian dissipation for a long time. We analyze state sharing process between two typical complex networks, that is, a small-world network corresponding to linear motif state sharing and a scale-free network corresponding to whole network sharing, respectively. Our results predict that linked nodes can be directly synchronized in small-world network, but the whole network will be synchronized only if some specific synchronization conditions are satisfied. Furthermore, we give the synchronization conditions analytically through analyzing network dynamics. This proposal paves the way for studying multi-interaction synchronization and achieving an effective quantum information processing in complex network.

010       Law of localization in chemical reaction networks

020       metabolic pathways. Here we developed a theory to predict the sensitivity, i.e. the responses of concentrations and fluxes to perturbations of enzymes, from network structure alone. Responses turn out to exhibit two characteristic patterns, $localization$ and $hierarchy$. We present a general theorem connecting sensitivity with network topology that explains these characteristic patterns. Our results imply that network topology is an origin of biological robustness. Finally, we suggest a strategy to determine real networks from experimental measurements.

010       Generating massive complex networks with hyperbolic geometry faster in   practice
021       Generative network models play an important role in algorithm development, scaling studies, network analysis, and realistic system benchmarks for graph data sets. 
020       The commonly used graph-based benchmark model R-MAT has some drawbacks concerning realism and the scaling behavior of network properties. A complex network model gaining considerable popularity builds random hyperbolic graphs, generated by distributing points within a disk in the hyperbolic plane and then adding edges between points whose hyperbolic distance is below a threshold. <br />We present in this paper a fast generation algorithm for such graphs. Our experiments show that our new generator achieves speedup factors of 3-60 over the best previous implementation. One billion edges can now be generated in under one minute on a shared-memory workstation. Furthermore, we present a dynamic extension to model gradual network change, while preserving at each step the point position probabilities.

010       Bypass rewiring and robustness of complex networks
021       A concept of bypass rewiring is introduced and random bypass rewiring is analytically and numerically investigated with simulations. 
020       Our results show that bypass rewiring makes networks robust against removal of nodes including random failures and attacks. In particular, random bypass rewiring connects all nodes except the removed nodes on an even degree infinite network and makes the percolation threshold 0 for arbitrary occupation probabilities. In our example, the even degree network is more robust than the original network with random bypass rewiring while the original network is more robust than the even degree networks without random bypass. We propose a greedy bypass rewiring algorithm which guarantees the maximum size of the largest component at each step, assuming which node will be removed next is unknown. The simulation result shows that the greedy bypass rewiring algorithm improves the robustness of the autonomous system of the Internet under attacks more than random bypass rewiring.

010       Representation of texts as complex networks: a mesoscopic approach
021       Statistical techniques that analyze texts, referred to as text analytics, have departed from the use of simple word count statistics towards a new paradigm. 
020       Text mining now hinges on a more sophisticated set of methods, including the representations in terms of complex networks. While well-established word-adjacency (co-occurrence) methods successfully grasp syntactical features of written texts, they are unable to represent important aspects of textual data, such as its topical structure, i.e. the sequence of subjects developing at a mesoscopic level along the text. Such aspects are often overlooked by current methodologies. In order to grasp the mesoscopic characteristics of semantical content in written texts, we devised a network model which is able to analyze documents in a multi-scale fashion. In the proposed model, a limited amount of adjacent paragraphs are represented as nodes, which are connected whenever they share a minimum semantical content. To illustrate the capabilities of our model, we present, as a case example, a qualitative analysis of "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland". We show that the mesoscopic structure of a document, modeled as a network, reveals many semantic traits of texts. Such an approach paves the way to a myriad of semantic-based applications. In addition, our approach is illustrated in a machine learning context, in which texts are classified among real texts and randomized instances.

010       node2vec: Scalable Feature Learning for Networks
021       Prediction tasks over nodes and edges in networks require careful effort in engineering features used by learning algorithms. 
020       Recent research in the broader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in automating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present feature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity of connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an algorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes in networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional space of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network neighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network neighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently explores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is based on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added flexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing state-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction in several real-world networks from diverse domains. Taken together, our work represents a new way for efficiently learning state-of-the-art task-independent representations in complex networks.

The algorithm elaborately arrange the matching order of nodes in order to minimize the size of the driver nodes set. The results on both synthetic and real networks indicate that the performance of proposed algorithm are better than the previous one. The algorithm may have various application in controlling complex networks.

Furthermore, we provide extensive empirical analyses to compare well-known methods on disparate real networks, and highlight the future directions. In despite of the emphasis on physics-rooted approaches, the unification of the language and comparison with cross-domain methods would trigger interdisciplinary solutions in the near future.

010       Generating maximally disassortative graphs with given degree   distribution
021       In this paper we consider the optimization problem of generating graphs with a prescribed degree distribution, such that the correlation between the degrees of connected nodes, as measured by Spearman's rho, is minimal. 
020       We provide an algorithm for solving this problem and obtain a complete characterization of the joint degree distribution in these maximally disassortative graphs, in terms of the size-biased degree distribution. As a result we get a lower bound for Spearman's rho on graphs with an arbitrary given degree distribution. We use this lower bound to show that for any fixed tail exponent, there exist scale-free degree sequences with this exponent such that the minimum value of Spearman's rho for all graphs with such degree sequences is arbitrary close to zero. This implies that specifying only the tail behavior of the degree distribution, as is often done in the analysis of complex networks, gives no guarantees for the minimum value of Spearman's rho.

010       Novel Performance Analysis of Network Coded Communications in   Single-Relay Networks
021       In this paper, we analyze the performance of a single-relay network in which the reliability is provided by means of Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC). 
020       We consider a scenario when both source and relay nodes can encode packets. Unlike the traditional approach to relay networks, we introduce a passive relay mode, in which the relay node simply retransmits collected packets in case it cannot decode them. In contrast with the previous studies, we derive a novel theoretical framework for the performance characterization of the considered relay network. We extend our analysis to a more general scenario, in which coding coefficients are generated from non-binary fields. The theoretical results are verified using simulation, for both binary and non-binary fields. It is also shown that the passive relay mode significantly improves the performance compared with the active-only case, offering an up to two-fold gain in terms of the decoding probability. The proposed framework can be used as a building block for the analysis of more complex network topologies.

010       Detecting Communities under Differential Privacy
021       Complex networks usually expose community structure with groups of nodes sharing many links with the other nodes in the same group and relatively few with the nodes of the rest. 
020       This feature captures valuable information about the organization and even the evolution of the network. Over the last decade, a great number of algorithms for community detection have been proposed to deal with the increasingly complex networks. However, the problem of doing this in a private manner is rarely considered. In this paper, we solve this problem under differential privacy, a prominent privacy concept for releasing private data. We analyze the major challenges behind the problem and propose several schemes to tackle them from two perspectives: input perturbation and algorithm perturbation. We choose Louvain method as the back-end community detection for input perturbation schemes and propose the method LouvainDP which runs Louvain algorithm on a noisy super-graph. For algorithm perturbation, we design ModDivisive using exponential mechanism with the modularity as the score. We have thoroughly evaluated our techniques on real graphs of different sizes and verified their outperformance over the state-of-the-art.

010       A Complex Network Approach for Nanoparticle Agglomeration Analysis in   Nanoscale Images
021       Complex networks have been widely used in science and technology because of their ability to represent several systems. 
020       One of these systems is found in Biochemistry, in which the synthesis of new nanoparticles is a hot topic. However, the interpretation of experimental results in the search of new nanoparticles poses several challenges. This is due to the characteristics of nanoparticles images and due to their multiple intricate properties; one property of recurrent interest is the agglomeration of particles. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces an approach that uses complex networks to detect and describe nanoparticle agglomerates so to foster easier and more insightful analyses. In this approach, each detected particle in an image corresponds to a vertice and the distances between the particles define a criterion for creating edges. Edges are created if the distance is smaller than a radius of interest. Once this network is set, we calculate several discrete measures able to reveal the most outstanding agglomerates in a nanoparticle image. Experimental results using images of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) of gold nanoparticles demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach over several samples, as reflected by the separability between particles in three usual settings. The results also demonstrated efficacy for both convex and non-convex agglomerates.

010       Generalized Hypergeometric Ensembles: Statistical Hypothesis Testing in   Complex Networks
021       Statistical ensembles of networks, i.e., probability spaces of all networks that are consistent with given aggregate statistics, have become instrumental in the analysis of complex networks. 
020       Their numerical and analytical study provides the foundation for the inference of topological patterns, the definition of network-analytic measures, as well as for model selection and statistical hypothesis testing. Contributing to the foundation of these data analysis techniques, in this Letter we introduce generalized hypergeometric ensembles, a broad class of analytically tractable statistical ensembles of finite, directed and weighted networks. This framework can be interpreted as a generalization of the classical configuration model, which is commonly used to randomly generate networks with a given degree sequence or distribution. Our generalization rests on the introduction of dyadic link propensities, which capture the degree-corrected tendencies of pairs of nodes to form edges between each other. Studying empirical and synthetic data, we show that our approach provides broad perspectives for model selection and statistical hypothesis testing in data on complex networks.

010       Equation-free analysis of a dynamically evolving multigraph
021       In order to illustrate the adaptation of traditional continuum numerical techniques to the study of complex network systems, we use the equation-free framework to analyze a dynamically evolving multigraph. 
020       This approach is based on coupling short intervals of direct dynamic network simulation with appropriately-defined lifting and restriction operators, mapping the detailed network description to suitable macroscopic (coarse-grained) variables and back. This enables the acceleration of direct simulations through Coarse Projective Integration (CPI), as well as the identification of coarse stationary states via a Newton-GMRES method. We also demonstrate the use of data-mining, both linear (principal component analysis, PCA) and nonlinear (diffusion maps, DMAPS) to determine good macroscopic variables (observables) through which one can coarse-grain the model. These results suggest methods for decreasing simulation times of dynamic real-world systems such as epidemiological network models. Additionally, the data-mining techniques could be applied to a diverse class of problems to search for a succint, low-dimensional description of the system in a small number of variables.

010       Fast and simple decycling and dismantling of networks
021       Decycling and dismantling of complex networks are underlying many important applications in network science. 
020       Recently these two closely related problems were tackled by several heuristic algorithms, simple and considerably sub-optimal, on the one hand, and time-consuming message-passing ones that evaluate single-node marginal probabilities, on the other hand. In this paper we propose a simple and extremely fast algorithm, CoreHD, which recursively removes nodes of the highest degree from the $2$-core of the network. CoreHD performs much better than all existing simple algorithms. When applied on real-world networks, it achieves equally good solutions as those obtained by the state-of-art iterative message-passing algorithms at greatly reduced computational cost, suggesting that CoreHD should be the algorithm of choice for many practical purposes.

010       Optimizing Synchronization Stability of the Kuramoto Model in Complex   Networks and Power Grids
021       Maintaining the stability of synchronization state is crucial for the functioning of many natural and artificial systems. 
020       In this study, we develop methods to optimize the synchronization stability of the Kuramoto model by minimizing the dominant Lyapunov exponent. With the help of the recently proposed cut-set space approximation of the steady states, we greatly simplify the objective function, and further derive its gradient and Hessian with respect to natural frequencies, which leads to an efficient algorithm with the quasi-Newton's method. The optimized systems are demonstrated to achieve better synchronization stability for the Kuramoto model with or without inertia in certain regimes. Hence our method is applicable in improving the stability of power grids. It is also viable to adjust the coupling strength of each link to improve the stability of the system. Various operational constraints can also be easily integrated into our scope by employing the interior point method in convex optimization. The properties of the optimized networks are also discussed.

010       Effect of Heterogeneous Transmission Rate on Epidemic Spreading Over   Scale Free Networks
021       In the present work the spread of epidemic is studied over complex networks which are characterized by power law degree distribution of links and heterogeneous rate of disease transmission. 
020       The random allocation of epidemic transmission rates to the nodes results in the heterogeneity, which in turn causes the segregation of nodes in terms of various sub populations. The aim of the study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among various sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such networks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible infected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to describe the spreading of epidemic over the networks. The study is parameterized in terms of variable $\lambda$, defined as the number of contacts a node makes with the fraction of its neighboring nodes. From the simulation results, it is found that the spread of epidemic on such networks is critical in terms of number of minimum contacts made by a node below which there is no outbreak of disease. The degree of infection in these networks is assessed from the size of epidemic defined in terms of fraction of infected nodes of the total number and their corresponding level of infection. The results of the parametric study demonstrates the dependence of the epidemic size upon number of concurrent contacts made by a node ($\lambda$ ) and the average number of links per node. In both these cases, the size of the epidemic is found to increase with the corresponding increase in respective parameters.

010       Emergent Hyperbolic Network Geometry
021       A large variety of interacting complex systems are characterized by interactions occurring between more than two nodes. 
020       These systems are described by simplicial complexes. Simplicial complexes are formed by simplices (nodes, links, triangles, tetrahedra etc.) that have a natural geometric interpretation. As such simplicial complexes are widely used in quantum gravity approaches that involve a discretization of spacetime. Here, by extending our knowledge of growing complex networks to growing simplicial complexes we investigate the nature of the emergent geometry of complex networks and explore whether this geometry is hyperbolic. Specifically we show that an hyperbolic network geometry emerges spontaneously from models of growing simplicial complexes that are purely combinatorial. The statistical and geometrical properties of the growing simplicial complexes strongly depend on their dimensionality and display the major universal properties of real complex networks (scale-free degree distribution, small-world and communities) at the same time. Interestingly, when the network dynamics includes an heterogeneous fitness of the faces, the growing simplicial complex can undergo phase transitions that are reflected by relevant changes in the network geometry.

020       This quite counter intuitive phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally and confirmed by numerical solutions of a deterministic dynamical system of rate equations. The occurrence of negative and positive cross correlation between parts of a complex system according to time scales, as proved in our simple arrangement, is relevant for the understanding and characterization of collective properties in complex networks.

010       On the Exploitation of Admittance Measurements for Wired Network   Topology Derivation
021       The knowledge of the topology of a wired network is often of fundamental importance. 
020       For instance, in the context of Power Line Communications (PLC) networks it is helpful to implement data routing strategies, while in power distribution networks and Smart Micro Grids (SMG) it is required for grid monitoring and for power flow management. In this paper, we use the transmission line theory to shed new light and to show how the topological properties of a wired network can be found exploiting admittance measurements at the nodes. An analytic proof is reported to show that the derivation of the topology can be done in complex networks under certain assumptions. We also analyze the effect of the network background noise on admittance measurements. In this respect, we propose a topology derivation algorithm that works in the presence of noise. We finally analyze the performance of the algorithm using values that are typical of power line distribution networks.

DL requires only knowledge of the ground state of the graph, eliminating the requirement to determine all possible degeneracies of a complex network. The algorithm is general and may be applied to any quantum graph.

010       Authorship attribution via network motifs identification
021       Concepts and methods of complex networks can be used to analyse texts at their different complexity levels. 
020       Examples of natural language processing (NLP) tasks studied via topological analysis of networks are keyword identification, automatic extractive summarization and authorship attribution. Even though a myriad of network measurements have been applied to study the authorship attribution problem, the use of motifs for text analysis has been restricted to a few works. The goal of this paper is to apply the concept of motifs, recurrent interconnection patterns, in the authorship attribution task. The absolute frequencies of all thirteen directed motifs with three nodes were extracted from the co-occurrence networks and used as classification features. The effectiveness of these features was verified with four machine learning methods. The results show that motifs are able to distinguish the writing style of different authors. In our best scenario, 57.5% of the books were correctly classified. The chance baseline for this problem is 12.5%. In addition, we have found that function words play an important role in these recurrent patterns. Taken together, our findings suggest that motifs should be further explored in other related linguistic tasks.

010       A Topological Representation for Taking Cities as a Coherent Whole
021       A city is a whole, as are all cities in a country. 
020       Within a whole, individual cities possess different degrees of wholeness, defined by Christopher Alexander as a life-giving order or simply a living structure. To characterize the wholeness and in particular to advocate for wholeness as an effective design principle, this paper develops a geographic representation that views cities as a whole. This geographic representation is topology-oriented, so fundamentally differs from existing geometry-based geographic representations. With the topological representation, all cities are abstracted as individual points and put into different hierarchical levels, according to their sizes and based on head/tail breaks - a classification scheme and visualization tool for data with a heavy tailed distribution. These points of different hierarchical levels are respectively used to create Thiessen polygons. Based on polygon-polygon relationships, we set up a complex network. In this network, small polygons point to adjacent large polygons at the same hierarchical level and contained polygons point to containing polygons across two consecutive hierarchical levels. We computed the degrees of wholeness for individual cities, and subsequently found that the degrees of wholeness possess both properties of differentiation and adaptation. To demonstrate, we developed four case studies of all China and UK natural cities, as well as Beijing and London natural cities, using massive amounts of street nodes and Tweet locations. The topological representation and the kind of topological analysis in general can be applied to any design or pattern, such as carpets, Baroque architecture and artifacts, and fractals in order to assess their beauty, echoing the introductory quote from Christopher Alexander. <br />Keywords: Wholeness, natural cities, head/tail breaks, complex networks, scaling hierarchy, urban design

010       Pair approximation for the q-voter model with independence on complex   networks
021       We investigate the q-voter model with stochastic noise arising from independence on complex networks. 
020       Using the pair approximation, we provide a comprehensive, mathematical description of its behavior and derive a formula for the critical point. The analytical results are validated by carrying out Monte Carlo experiments. The pair approximation prediction exhibits substantial agreement with simulations, especially for networks with weak clustering and large average degree. Nonetheless, for the average degree close to q, some discrepancies originate. It is the first time we are aware of that the presented approach has been applied to the nonlinear voter dynamics with noise. Up till now, the analytical results have been obtained only for a complete graph. We show that in the limiting case the prediction of pair approximation coincides with the known solution on a fully connected network.

010       Investigating the structure and fragmentation of a highly filamentary   IRDC
021       We present 3.7 arcsec (~0.05 pc) resolution 3.2 mm dust continuum observations from the IRAM PdBI, with the aim of studying the structure and fragmentation of the filamentary Infrared Dark Cloud G035.39-00.33. 
020       The continuum emission is segmented into a series of 13 quasi-regularly spaced (~0.18pc) cores, following the major axis of the IRDC. We compare the spatial distribution of the cores with that predicted by theoretical work describing the fragmentation of hydrodynamic fluid cylinders, finding a significant (a factor of ~8) discrepancy between the two. Our observations are consistent with the picture emerging from kinematic studies of molecular clouds suggesting that the cores are harboured within a complex network of independent sub-filaments. This result emphasizes the importance of considering the underlying physical structure, and potentially, dynamically important magnetic fields, in any fragmentation analysis. The identified cores exhibit a range in (peak) beam-averaged column density ($3.6{\rm x}10^{23}{\rm cm}^{-2}&lt;N_{H,c}&lt;8.0{\rm x}10^{23}{\rm cm}^{-2}$), mass ($8.1M_{\odot}&lt;M_{c}&lt;26.1M_{\odot}$), and number density ($6.1{\rm x}10^{5}{\rm cm}^{-3}&lt;n_{H, c, eq}&lt;14.7{\rm x}10^{5}{\rm cm}^{-3}$). Two of these cores, dark in the mid-infrared, centrally-concentrated, monolithic (with no traceable substructure at our PdBI resolution), and with estimated masses of the order ~20-25$M_{\odot}$, are good candidates for the progenitors of intermediate-to-high-mass stars. Virial parameters span a range $0.2&lt;\alpha_{\rm vir}&lt;1.3$. Without additional support, possibly from dynamically important magnetic fields with strengths of the order 230$\mu$G&lt;B&lt;670$\mu$G, the cores are susceptible to gravitational collapse. These results may imply a multilayered fragmentation process, which incorporates the formation of sub-filaments, embedded cores, and the possibility of further fragmentation.

010       Inducing and Mitigating a Self-Reinforcing Degradation in   Decision-making Teams
021       The models in this paper demonstrate how self-reinforcing error due to positive feedback can lead to overload and saturation of decision-making elements, and ultimately the cascading collapse of an organization due to the propagation of overload and erroneous decisions throughout the organization. 
020       We begin the paper with an analysis of the stability of the decision-making aspects of command organizations from a system-theoretic perspective. A simple dynamic model shows how an organization can enter into a self-reinforcing cycle of increasing decision workload until the demand for decisions exceeds the decision-making capacity of the organization. We then extend the model to more complex networked organizations and show that they also experience a form of self-reinforcing degradation. In particular, we find that the degradation in decision quality has a tendency to propagate through the hierarchical structure, i.e. overload at one location affects other locations by overloading the higher-level components which then in turn overload their subordinates. Our computational experiments suggest several strategies for mitigating this type of malfunction: dumping excessive load, empowering lower echelons, minimizing the need for coordination, using command-by-negation, insulating weak performers, and applying on-line diagnostics. We describe a method to allocate decision responsibility and arrange information flow dynamically within a team of decision-makers for command and control.

010       Growing complex network of citations of scientific papers --   measurements and modeling
021       To quantify the mechanism of a complex network growth we focus on the network of citations of scientific papers and use a combination of the theoretical and experimental tools to uncover microscopic details of this network growth. 
020       Namely, we develop a stochastic model of citation dynamics based on copying/redirection/triadic closure mechanism. In a complementary and coherent way, the model accounts both for statistics of references of scientific papers and for their citation dynamics. Originating in empirical measurements, the model is cast in such a way that it can be verified quantitatively in every aspect. Such verification is performed by measuring citation dynamics of Physics papers. The measurements revealed nonlinear citation dynamics, the nonlinearity being intricately related to network topology. The nonlinearity has far-reaching consequences including non-stationary citation distributions, diverging citation trajectory of similar papers, runaways or "immortal papers" with infinite citation lifetime etc. Thus, our most important finding is nonlinearity in complex network growth. In a more specific context, our results can be a basis for quantitative probabilistic prediction of citation dynamics of individual papers and of the journal impact factor.

010       Transient Analysis of a Resource-limited Recovery Policy for Epidemics:   a Retrial Queueing Approach
021       Knowledge on the dynamics of standard epidemic models and their variants over complex networks has been well-established primarily in the stationary regime, with relatively little light shed on their transient behavior. 
020       In this paper, we analyze the transient characteristics of the classical susceptible-infected (SI) process with a recovery policy modeled as a state-dependent retrial queueing system in which arriving infected nodes, upon finding all the limited number of recovery units busy, join a virtual buffer and try persistently for service in order to regain susceptibility. In particular, we formulate the stochastic SI epidemic model with added retrial phenomenon as a finite continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) and derive the Laplace transforms of the underlying transient state probability distributions and corresponding moments for a closed population of size $N$ driven by homogeneous and heterogeneous contacts. Our numerical results reveal the strong influence of infection heterogeneity and retrial frequency on the transient behavior of the model for various performance measures.

010       On Varying Topology of Complex Networks and Performance Limitations of   Community Detection Algorithms
021       One of the most widely studied problem in mining and analysis of complex networks is the detection of community structures. 
020       The problem has been extensively studied by researchers due to its high utility and numerous applications in various domains. Many algorithmic solutions have been proposed for the community detection problem but the quest to find the best algorithm is still on. More often than not, researchers focus on developing fast and accurate algorithms that can be generically applied to networks from a variety of domains without taking into consideration the structural and topological variations in these networks. <br />In this paper, we evaluate the performance of different clustering algorithms as a function of varying network topology. Along with the well known LFR model to generate benchmark networks with communities,we also propose a new model named Naive Scale Free Model to study the behavior of community detection algorithms with respect to different topological features. More specifically, we are interested in the size of networks, the size of community structures, the average connectivity of nodes and the ratio of inter-intra cluster edges. Results reveal several limitations of the current popular network clustering algorithms failing to correctly find communities. This suggests the need to revisit the design of current clustering algorithms that fail to incorporate varying topological features of different networks.

010       Community detection in networks using self-avoiding random walks
021       Different kinds of random walks have proven to be useful in the study of structural properties of complex networks. 
020       Among them, the restricted dynamics of self-avoiding random walks (SAW), which visit only at most once each vertex in the same walk, has been successfully used in network exploration. The detection of communities of strongly connected vertices in networks remains an open problem, despite its importance, due to the high computational complexity of the associated optimization problem and the lack of a unique formal definition of communities. In this work, we propose a SAW-based method to extract the community distribution of a network and show that it achieves high modularity scores, specially for real-world networks. We combine SAW with principal component analysis to define the dissimilarity measure to be used for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. To evaluate the performance of this method we compare it with four popular methods for community detection: Girvan-Newman, Fastgreedy, Walktrap and Infomap using two types of synthetic networks and six well-known real-world cases.

021       We introduce Forman-Ricci curvature and its corresponding flow as characteristics for complex networks attempting to extend the common approach of node-based network analysis by edge-based characteristics. 
020       Following a theoretical introduction and mathematical motivation, we apply the proposed network-analytic methods to static and dynamic complex networks and compare the results with established node-based characteristics. Our work suggests a number of applications for data mining, including denoising and clustering of experimental data, as well as extrapolation of network evolution.

010       Noise-Induced Polarization Switch in Single and Multiplex Complex   Networks
021       The combination of bistability and noise is ubiquitous in complex systems, from biological to social interactions, and has important implications for their functioning and resilience. 
020       We analyze a simple three-state model for bistability in networks under varying unbiased noise. In a fully connected network increasing noise yields a collapse of bistability to an unpolarised state. In contrast, in complex networks noise can abruptly switch the polarization state in an irreversible way. When two networks are combined through increasing multiplex coupling, one is dominant and progressively imposes its state on the other, offsetting or promoting the ability of noise to switch polarization. Our results show that dynamical correlations and asymmetry in dynamical processes in networks are sufficient for allowing unbiased noise to produce abrupt irreversible transitions between extremes, which can be neutralized or enhanced by multiplex coupling.

010       Mining and modeling character networks
021       We investigate social networks of characters found in cultural works such as novels and films. 
020       These character networks exhibit many of the properties of complex networks such as skewed degree distribution and community structure, but may be of relatively small order with a high multiplicity of edges. Building on recent work of beveridge, we consider graph extraction, visualization, and network statistics for three novels: Twilight by Stephanie Meyer, Steven King's The Stand, and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Coupling with 800 character networks from films found in the <a href="http://moviegalaxies.com/">this http URL</a> database, we compare the data sets to simulations from various stochastic complex networks models including random graphs with given expected degrees (also known as the Chung-Lu model), the configuration model, and the preferential attachment model. Using machine learning techniques based on motif (or small subgraph) counts, we determine that the Chung-Lu model best fits character networks and we conjecture why this may be the case.

010       A Web-based Tool for Identifying Strategic Intervention Points in   Complex Systems
021       Steering a complex system towards a desired outcome is a challenging task. 
020       The lack of clarity on the system's exact architecture and the often scarce scientific data upon which to base the operationalisation of the dynamic rules that underpin the interactions between participant entities are two contributing factors. We describe an analytical approach that builds on Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to address the latter and represent the system as a complex network. We apply results from network controllability to address the former and determine minimal control configurations - subsets of factors, or system levers, which comprise points for strategic intervention in steering the system. We have implemented the combination of these techniques in an analytical tool that runs in the browser, and generates all minimal control configurations of a complex network. We demonstrate our approach by reporting on our experience of working alongside industrial, local-government, and NGO stakeholders in the Humber region, UK. Our results are applied to the decision-making process involved in the transition of the region to a bio-based economy.

010       A Comparative Analysis of Community Detection Algorithms on Artificial   Networks
021       Many community detection algorithms have been developed to uncover the mesoscopic properties of complex networks. 
020       However how good an algorithm is, in terms of accuracy and computing time, remains still open. Testing algorithms on real-world network has certain restrictions which made their insights potentially biased: the networks are usually small, and the underlying communities are not defined objectively. In this study, we employ the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi benchmark graph to test eight state-of-the-art algorithms. We quantify the accuracy using complementary measures and algorithms' computing time. Based on simple network properties and the aforementioned results, we provide guidelines that help to choose the most adequate community detection algorithm for a given network. Moreover, these rules allow uncovering limitations in the use of specific algorithms given macroscopic network properties. Our contribution is threefold: firstly, we provide actual techniques to determine which is the most suited algorithm in most circumstances based on observable properties of the network under consideration. Secondly, we use the mixing parameter as an easily measurable indicator of finding the ranges of reliability of the different algorithms. Finally, we study the dependency with network size focusing on both the algorithm's predicting power and the effective computing time.

010       Rumours spread slowly in a small world spatial network
021       Rumour spreading is a protocol for modelling the spread of information through a network via user-to-user interaction. 
020       The Spatial Preferred Attachment (SPA) model is a random graph model for complex networks: vertices are placed in a metric space, and the link probability depends on the metric distance between vertices, and on their degree. We show that the SPA model typically produces graphs that have small effective diameter, i.e. $O(\log^2 n)$, while rumour spreading is relatively slow, namely polynomial in $n$.

021       The effect of burstiness in complex networks has received considerable attention. 
020       In particular, its effect on temporal distance and delays in the air transportation system is significant owing to their huge impact on our society. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two indexes of temporal distance based on passengers' behavior and analyze the effect. As a result, we find that burstiness shortens the temporal distance while delays are increased. Moreover, we discover that the positive effect of burstiness is lost when flight schedules get overcrowded.

010       The Many Faces of Graph Dynamics
021       The topological structure of complex networks has fascinated researchers for several decades, resulting in the discovery of many universal properties and reoccurring characteristics of different kinds of networks. 
020       However, much less is known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality are not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time. <br />Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution patterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific patterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a "one fits it all" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these intuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables and metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as for interpolating graph evolutions. <br />To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes, this paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node importance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality distance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given centrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances reflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in case of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs. <br />We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and seven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the usefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared to a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the considered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the dynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.

010       Blankets Joint Posterior score for learning Markov network structures
021       Markov networks are extensively used to model complex sequential, spatial, and relational interactions in a wide range of fields. 
020       By learning the structure of independences of a domain, more accurate joint probability distributions can be obtained for inference tasks or, more directly, for interpreting the most significant relations among the variables. Recently, several researchers have investigated techniques for automatically learning the structure from data by obtaining the probabilistic maximum-a-posteriori structure given the available data. However, all the approximations proposed decompose the posterior of the whole structure into local sub-problems, by assuming that the posteriors of the Markov blankets of all the variables are mutually independent. In this work, we propose a scoring function for relaxing such assumption. The Blankets Joint Posterior score computes the joint posterior of structures as a joint distribution of the collection of its Markov blankets. Essentially, the whole posterior is obtained by computing the posterior of the blanket of each variable as a conditional distribution that takes into account information from other blankets in the network. We show in our experimental results that the proposed approximation can improve the sample complexity of state-of-the-art scores when learning complex networks, where the independence assumption between blanket variables is clearly incorrect.

010       Mixed-order phase transition in a two-step contagion model with single   infectious seed
021       A hybrid phase transition (HPT) that exhibits properties of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions at the same transition point has been observed in diverse complex systems. 
020       Previous studies of the HPTs on complex networks mainly focused on whether the order parameter is continuous or discontinuous. However, more careful and fundamental questions on the critical behaviors of the HPT such as how the divergences of the susceptibility and of the correlation size are affected by the discontinuity of the order parameter have been addressed. Here, we consider a generalized epidemic model that is known to exhibit a discontinuous transition as a spinodal transition. Performing extensive numerical simulations and using finite-size scaling analysis, we examine diverging behaviors of the susceptibility and the correlation size. We find that when there is one infectious node and under a certain condition, the order parameter can exhibit a discontinuous jump but does not exhibit any critical behavior before or after the jump. This feature differs from what we observed in HPTs in the percolation pruning process. However, critical behavior appears in the form of a power-law behavior of the outbreak size distribution. The mean outbreak size, corresponding to the susceptibility, diverge following the conventional percolation behavior. Thus a mixed-order transition occurs. The hyperscaling relation does not hold.

010       Performance of attack strategies on modular networks
021       Vulnerabilities of complex networks have became a trend topic in complex systems recently due to its real world applications. 
020       Most real networks tend to be very fragile to high betweenness adaptive attacks. However, recent contributions have shown the importance of interconnected nodes in the integrity of networks and module-based attacks have appeared promising when compared to traditional malicious non-adaptive attacks. In the present work we deeply explore the trade-off associated with attack procedures, introducing a generalized robustness measure and presenting an attack performance index that takes into account both robustness of the network against the attack and the run-time needed to obtained the list of targeted nodes for the attack. Besides, we introduce the concept of deactivation point aimed to mark the point at which the network stops to function properly. We then show empirically that non-adaptive module-based attacks perform better than high degree and betweenness adaptive attacks in networks with well defined community structures and consequent high modularity.

010       Tristable and multiple bistable activity in complex random binary   networks of two-state units
021       We study complex networks of stochastic two-state units. 
020       Our aim is to model discrete stochastic excitable dynamics with a rest and an excited state. Both states are assumed to possess different waiting time distributions. The rest state is treated as an activation process with an exponentially distributed life time, whereas the latter in the excited state shall have a constant mean which may originate from any distribution. The activation rate of any single unit is determined by its neighbors according to a random complex network structure. In order to treat this problem in an analytical way, we use a heterogeneous mean-field approximation yielding a set of equations general valid for uncorrelated random networks. Based on this derivation we focus on random binary networks where the network is solely comprised of nodes with either of two degrees. The ratio between the two degrees is shown to be a crucial parameter. Dependent on the composition of the network the steady states show the usual transition from disorder to homogeneous ordered bistability as well as new scenarios that include inhomogeneous ordered and disordered bistability as well as tristability. The various steady states differ in their spiking activity expressed by a state dependent spiking rate. Numerical simulations agree with analytic results of the heterogeneous mean-field approximation.

010       Convexity in complex networks
021       Metric graph properties lie in the heart of the analysis of complex networks, while in this paper we study their convexity through mathematical definition of a convex subgraph. 
020       A subgraph is convex if every geodesic path between the nodes of the subgraph lies entirely within the subgraph. According to our perception of convexity, convex network is such in which every connected subset of nodes induces a convex subgraph. We show that convexity is an inherent property of many networks that is not present in a random graph. Most convex are spatial infrastructure networks and social collaboration graphs due to their tree-like or clique-like structure, whereas the food web is the only network studied that is truly non-convex. Core-periphery networks are regionally convex as they can be divided into a non-convex core surrounded by a convex periphery. Random graphs, however, are only locally convex meaning that any connected subgraph of size smaller than the average geodesic distance between the nodes is almost certainly convex. We present different measures of network convexity and discuss its applications in the study of networks.

We study this model market on regular lattices in two--dimension as well as on random complex networks; in the critical state fluctuations in an activity signal exhibit properties that are characteristic of avalanches observed in models of self-organized criticality, and these can be described by power--law distributions.

010       Efficient and Accurate Robustness Estimation for Large Complex Networks
021       Robustness estimation is critical for the design and maintenance of resilient networks, one of the global challenges of the 21st century. 
020       Existing studies exploit network metrics to generate attack strategies, which simulate intentional attacks in a network, and compute a metric-induced robustness estimation. While some metrics are easy to compute, e.g. degree centrality, other, more accurate, metrics require considerable computation efforts, e.g. betweennes centrality. We propose a new algorithm for estimating the robustness of a network in sub-quadratic time, i.e., significantly faster than betweenness centrality. Experiments on real-world networks and random networks show that our algorithm estimates the robustness of networks close to or even better than betweenness centrality, while being orders of magnitudes faster. Our work contributes towards scalable, yet accurate methods for robustness estimation of large complex networks.

010       Impact of asymptomatic infection on coupled disease-behavior dynamics in   complex networks
021       Studies on how to model the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted increasing attention. 
020       Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms, labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral responses \emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two models are given by two methods. The analytic results \emph{quantitatively} describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection, the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic thresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS model.

010       Refining Approximating Betweenness Centrality Based on Samplings
021       Betweenness Centrality (BC) is an important measure used widely in complex network analysis, such as social network, web page search, etc. 
020       Computing the exact BC values is highly time consuming. Currently the fastest exact BC determining algorithm is given by Brandes, taking $O(nm)$ time for unweighted graphs and $O(nm+n^2\log n)$ time for weighted graphs, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges in the graph. Due to the extreme difficulty of reducing the time complexity of exact BC determining problem, many researchers have considered the possibility of any satisfactory BC approximation algorithms, especially those based on samplings. Bader et al. give the currently best BC approximation algorithm, with a high probability to successfully estimate the BC of one vertex within a factor of $1/\varepsilon$ using $\varepsilon t$ samples, where $t$ is the ratio between $n^2$ and the BC value of the vertex. However, some of the algorithmic parameters in Bader's work are not yet tightly bounded, leaving some space to improve their algorithm. In this project, we revisit Bader's algorithm, give more tight bounds on the estimations, and improve the performance of the approximation algorithm, i.e., fewer samples and lower factors. On the other hand, Riondato proposes a non-adaptive BC approximation method with samplings on shortest paths. We investigate the possibility to give an adaptive algorithm with samplings on vertices. With rigorous reasoning, we show that this algorithm can also give bounded approximation factors and number of samplings. To evaluate our results, we also conduct extensive experiments using real-world datasets, and find that both our algorithms can achieve acceptable performance. We verify that our work can improve the current BC approximation algorithm with better parameters, i.e., higher successful probabilities, lower factors and fewer samples.

010       Improving link prediction in complex networks by adaptively exploiting   multiple structural features of networks
021       So far, many network-structure-based link prediction methods have been proposed. 
020       However, these methods only highlight one or two structural features of networks, and then use the methods to predict missing links in different networks. The performances of these existing methods are not always satisfied in all cases since each network has its unique underlying structural features. In this paper, by analyzing different real networks, we find that the structural features of different networks are remarkably different. In particular, even in the same network, their inner structural features are utterly different. Therefore, more structural features should be considered. However, owing to the remarkably different structural features, the contributions of different features are hard to be given in advance. Inspired by these facts, an \emph{adaptive} fusion model regarding link prediction is proposed to incorporate multiple structural features. In the model, a logistic function combing multiple structural features is defined, then the weight of each feature in the logistic function is \emph{adaptively} determined by exploiting the known structure information. Last, we use the "learnt" logistic function to predict the connection probabilities of missing links. According to our experimental results, we find that the performance of our adaptive fusion model is better than many similarity indices.

010       Small-World Brain Networks Revisited
021       It is nearly 20 years since the concept of a small-world network was first quantitatively defined, by a combination of high clustering and short path length; and about 10 years since this metric of complex network topology began to be widely applied to analysis of neuroimaging and other neuroscience data as part of the rapid growth of the new field of connectomics. 
020       Here we review briefly the foundational concepts of graph theoretical estimation and generation of small-world networks. We take stock of some of the key developments in the field in the past decade and we consider in some detail the implications of recent studies using high-resolution tract-tracing methods to map the anatomical networks of the macaque and the mouse. In doing so, we draw attention to the important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain network analysis in the past, and the topology of weighted graphs, which retain more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies. We conclude by highlighting some possible future trends in the further development of weighted small-worldness as part of a deeper and broader understanding of the topology and the functional value of the strong and weak links between areas of mammalian cortex.

010       Effective Distances for Epidemics Spreading on Complex Networks
021       We show that the recently introduced logarithmic metrics used to predict disease arrival times on complex networks are approximations of more general network-based measures derived from random walks theory. 
020       Using the daily air-traffic transportation data we perform numerical experiments to compare the infection arrival time with this alternative metric that is obtained by accounting for multiple walks instead of only the most probable path. The comparison with direct simulations of arrival times reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest path approach used previously. In addition our method allows to connect fundamental observables in epidemic spreading with the cumulant generating function of the hitting time for a Markov chain. Our results provides a general and computationally efficient approach to the problem using only algebraic methods.

010       Pricing and Optimization in Shared Vehicle Systems: An Approximation   Framework
021       Optimizing shared vehicle systems (bike-sharing/car-sharing/ride-sharing) is more challenging compared to traditional resource allocation settings due to the presence of \emph{complex network externalities} -- changes in the demand/supply at any location affect future supply throughout the system within short timescales. 
020       These externalities are well captured by steady-state Markovian models, which are therefore widely used to analyze such systems. However, using such models to design pricing/control policies is computationally difficult since the resulting optimization problems are high-dimensional and non-convex. <br />To this end, we develop a general approximation framework for designing pricing policies in shared vehicle systems, based on a novel convex relaxation which we term \emph{elevated flow relaxation}. Our approach provides the first efficient algorithms with \emph{rigorous approximation guarantees} for a wide range of objective functions (throughput, revenue, welfare). For any shared vehicle system with $n$ stations and $m$ vehicles, our framework provides a pricing policy with an approximation ratio of $1+(n-1)/m$. This guarantee is particularly meaningful when $m/n$, the average number of vehicles per station is large, as is often the case in practice. <br />Further, the simplicity of our approach allows us to extend it to more complex settings: rebalancing empty vehicles, redirecting riders to nearby vehicles, multi-objective settings (such as Ramsey pricing), incorporating travel-times, etc. Our approach yields efficient algorithms with the same approximation guarantees for all these problems, and in the process, obtains as special cases several existing heuristics and asymptotic guarantees.

010       Complex Network Analysis of Brazilian Power Grid
021       Power Grids and other delivery networks has been attracted some attention by the network literature last decades. 
020       Despite the Power Grids dynamics has been controlled by computer systems and human operators, the static features of this type of network can be studied and analyzed. The topology of the Brazilian Power Grid (BPG) was studied in this work. We obtained the spatial structure of the BPG from the ONS (electric systems national operator), consisting of high-voltage transmission lines, generating stations and substations. The local low-voltage substations and local power delivery as well the dynamic features of the network were neglected. We analyze the complex network of the BPG and identify the main topological information, such as the mean degree, the degree distribution, the network size and the clustering coefficient to caracterize the complex network. We also detected the critical locations on the network and, therefore, the more susceptible points to lead to a cascading failure and even to a blackouts. Surprisely, due to the characteristic of the topology and physical structure of the network, we show that the BPG is resilient against random failures, since the random removal of links does not affect significantly the size of the largest cluster. We observe that when a fraction of the links are randomly removed, the network may disintegrates into smaller and disconnected parts, however, the power grid largest component remains connected. We believe that the even a static study of the network topology can help to identify the critical situations and also prevent failures and possible blackouts on the network.

010       WNetKAT: A Weighted SDN Programming and Verification Language
021       Programmability and verifiability lie at the heart of the software-defined networking paradigm. 
020       While OpenFlow and its match-action concept provide primitive operations to manipulate hardware configurations, over the last years, several more expressive network programming languages have been developed. This paper presents WNetKAT, the first network programming language accounting for the fact that networks are inherently weighted, and communications subject to capacity constraints (e.g., in terms of bandwidth) and costs (e.g., latency or monetary costs). WNetKAT is based on a syntactic and semantic extension of the NetKAT algebra. We demonstrate several relevant applications for WNetKAT, including cost- and capacity-aware reachability, as well as quality-of-service and fairness aspects. These applications do not only apply to classic, splittable and unsplittable (s; t)-flows, but also generalize to more complex network functions and service chains. For example, WNetKAT allows to model flows which need to traverse certain waypoint functions, which may change the traffic rate. This paper also shows the relation between the equivalence problem of WNetKAT and the equivalence problem of the weighted finite automata, which implies undecidability of the former. However, this paper also succeeds to prove the decidability of another useful problem, which is sufficient in many practical scnearios: whether an expression equals to 0. Moreover, we initiate the discussion of decidable subsets of the whole language.

010       Coupled dynamics of node and link states in complex networks: A model   for language competition
021       Inspired by language competition processes, we present a model of coupled evolution of node and link states. 
020       In particular, we focus on the interplay between the use of a language and the preference or attitude of the speakers towards it, which we model, respectively, as a property of the interactions between speakers (a link state) and as a property of the speakers themselves (a node state). Furthermore, we restrict our attention to the case of two socially equivalent languages and to socially inspired network topologies based on a mechanism of triadic closure. As opposed to most of the previous literature, where language extinction is an inevitable outcome of the dynamics, we find a broad range of possible asymptotic configurations, which we classify as: frozen extinction states, frozen coexistence states, and dynamically trapped coexistence states. Moreover, metastable coexistence states with very long survival times and displaying a non-trivial dynamics are found to be abundant. Interestingly, a system size scaling analysis shows, on the one hand, that the probability of language extinction vanishes exponentially for increasing system sizes and, on the other hand, that the time scale of survival of the non-trivial dynamical metastable states increases linearly with the size of the system. Thus, non-trivial dynamical coexistence is the only possible outcome for large enough systems. Finally, we show how this coexistence is characterized by one of the languages becoming clearly predominant while the other one becomes increasingly confined to "ghetto-like" structures: small groups of bilingual speakers arranged in triangles, with a strong preference for the minority language, and using it for their intra-group interactions while they switch to the predominant language for communications with the rest of the population.

010       Articulation Points in Complex Networks
021       An articulation point in a network is a node whose removal disconnects the network. 
020       Those nodes play key roles in ensuring connectivity of many real-world networks, from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and terrorist communication networks. Despite their fundamental importance, a general framework of studying articulation points in complex networks is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study key issues pertinent to articulation points, e.g. the expected number of them and the network vulnerability against their removal, in an arbitrary complex network. We find that a greedy articulation point removal process provides us a novel perspective on the organizational principles of complex networks. Moreover, this process is associated with two fundamentally different types of percolation transitions with a rich phase diagram. Our results shed light on the design of more resilient infrastructure networks and the effective destruction of terrorist communication networks.

010       Miuz: measuring the impact of disconnecting a node
021       In this article we present Miuz, a robustness index for complex networks. 
020       Miuz measures the impact of disconnecting a node from the network while comparing the sizes of the remaining connected components. Strictly speaking, Miuz for a node is defined as the inverse of the size of the largest connected component divided by the sum of the sizes of the remaining ones. We tested our index in attack strategies where the nodes are disconnected in decreasing order of a specified metric. We considered Miuz and other well-known centrality measures such as betweenness, degree , and harmonic centrality. All of these metrics were compared regarding the behavior of the robust-ness (R-index) during the attacks. In an attempt to simulate the internet backbone, the attacks were performed in complex networks with power-law degree distributions (scale-free networks). Preliminary results show that attacks based on disconnecting a few number of nodes Miuz are more dangerous (decreasing the robustness) than the same attacks based on other centrality measures. We believe that Miuz, as well as other measures based on the size of the largest connected component, provides a good addition to other robustness metrics for complex networks.

010       Unifying Markov Chain Approach for Disease and Rumor Spreading in   Complex Networks
021       Spreading processes are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems. 
020       They can be studied via a plethora of models, depending on the specific details of the phenomena under study. Disease contagion and rumor spreading are among the most important of these processes due to their practical relevance. However, despite the similarities between them, current models address both spreading dynamics separately. In this paper, we propose a general information spreading model that is based on discrete time Markov chains. The model includes all the transitions that are plausible for both a disease contagion process and rumor propagation. We show that our model not only covers the traditional spreading schemes, but that it also contains some features relevant in social dynamics, such as apathy, forgetting, and lost/recovering of interest. The model is evaluated analytically to obtain the spreading thresholds and the early time dynamical behavior for the contact and reactive processes in several scenarios. Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the Markov chain formalism is highly accurate while it excels in computational efficiency. We round off our work by showing how the proposed framework can be applied to the study of spreading processes occurring on social networks.

010       A Scalable Algorithm for Structure Identification of Complex Gene   Regulatory Network from Temporal Expression Data
021       Motivation: Gene regulatory interactions are of fundamental importance to various biological functions and processes. 
020       However, only a few previous computational studies have claimed success in revealing genome-wide regulatory landscapes from temporal gene expression data, especially for complex eukaryotes like human. Moreover, recent work suggests that these methods still suffer from the curse of dimensionality if network size increases to 100 or higher. <br />Result: We present a novel scalable algorithm for identifying genome-wide regulatory network structures. The highlight of our method is that its superior performance does not degenerate even for a network size on the order of $10^4$, and is thus readily applicable to large-scale complex networks. Such a breakthrough is achieved by considering both prior biological knowledge and multiple topological properties (i.e., sparsity and hub gene structure) of complex networks in the regularized formulation. We also illustrate the application of our algorithm in practice using the time-course expression data from an influenza infection study in respiratory epithelial cells. <br />Availability and Implementation: The algorithm described in this article is implemented in MATLAB$^\circledR$.

010       Spectral entropies as information-theoretic tools for complex network   comparison
021       Any physical system can be viewed from the perspective that information is implicitly represented in its state. 
020       However, the quantification of this information when it comes to complex networks has remained largely elusive. In this work, we use techniques inspired by quantum statistical mechanics to define an entropy measure for complex networks and to develop a set of information-theoretic tools, based on network spectral properties, such as Renyi q-entropy, generalized Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences, the latter allowing us to define a natural distance measure between complex networks. First we show that by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between an observed network and a parametric network model, inference of model parameter(s) by means of maximum-likelihood estimation can be achieved and model selection can be performed appropriate information criteria. Second, we show that the information-theoretic metric quantifies the distance between pairs of networks and we can use it, for instance, to cluster the layers of a multilayer system. By applying this framework to networks corresponding to sites of the human microbiome, we perform hierarchical cluster analysis and recover with high accuracy existing community-based associations. Our results imply that spectral based statistical inference in complex networks results in demonstrably superior performance as well as a conceptual backbone, filling a gap towards a network information theory.

010       Multivariate Dependence Beyond Shannon Information
021       Accurately determining dependency structure is critical to discovering a system's causal organization. 
020       We recently showed that the transfer entropy fails in a key aspect of this---measuring information flow---due to its conflation of dyadic and polyadic relationships. We extend this observation to demonstrate that this is true of all such Shannon information measures when used to analyze multivariate dependencies. This has broad implications, particularly when employing information to express the organization and mechanisms embedded in complex systems, including the burgeoning efforts to combine complex network theory with information theory. Here, we do not suggest that any aspect of information theory is wrong. Rather, the vast majority of its informational measures are simply inadequate for determining the meaningful dependency structure within joint probability distributions. Therefore, such information measures are inadequate for discovering intrinsic causal relations. We close by demonstrating that such distributions exist across an arbitrary set of variables.

010       Chimera in a neuronal network model of the cat brain
021       Neuronal systems have been modeled by complex networks in different description levels. 
020       Recently, it has been verified that networks can simultaneously exhibit one coherent and other incoherent domain, known as chimera states. In this work, we study the existence of chimera states in a network considering the connectivity matrix based on the cat cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex of the cat can be separated in 65 cortical areas organised into the four cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and frontolimbic. We consider a network where the local dynamics is given by the Hindmarsh-Rose model. The Hindmarsh-Rose equations are a well known model of neuronal activity that has been considered to simulate membrane potential in neuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as well as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the existence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of desynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera states with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with desynchronised spikes.

010       Generating realistic scaled complex networks
021       Research on generative models is a central project in the emerging field of network science, and it studies how statistical patterns found in real networks could be generated by formal rules. 
020       Output from these generative models is then the basis for designing and evaluating computational methods on networks, and for verification and simulation studies. During the last two decades, a variety of models has been proposed with an ultimate goal of achieving comprehensive realism for the generated networks. In this study, we (a) introduce a new generator, termed ReCoN; (b) explore how ReCoN and some existing models can be fitted to an original network to produce a structurally similar replica, (c) use ReCoN to produce networks much larger than the original exemplar, and finally (d) discuss open problems and promising research directions. In a comparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many other state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a scalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving important properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the exemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.

010       Multiple predator based capture process on complex networks
021       The predator/prey (capture) problem is a prototype of many network-related applications. 
020       We study the capture process on complex networks by considering multiple predators from multiple sources. In our model, some lions start from multiple sources simultaneously to capture the lamb by biased random walks, which are controlled with a free parameter $\alpha$. We derive the distribution of the lamb's lifetime and the expected lifetime $\left\langle T\right\rangle $. Through simulation, we find that the expected lifetime drops substantially with the increasing number of lions. We also study how the underlying topological structure affects the capture process, and obtain that locating on small-degree nodes is better than large-degree nodes to prolong the lifetime of the lamb. Moreover, dense or homogeneous network structures are against the survival of the lamb.

010       Critical noise of majority-vote model on complex networks
021       The majority-vote model with noise is one of the simplest nonequilibrium statistical model that has been extensively studied in the context of complex networks. 
020       However, the relationship between the critical noise where the order-disorder phase transition takes place and the topology of the underlying networks is still lacking. In the paper, we use the heterogeneous mean-field theory to derive the rate equation for governing the model's dynamics that can analytically determine the critical noise $f_c$ in the limit of infinite network size $N\rightarrow \infty$. The result shows that $f_c$ depends on the ratio of ${\left\langle k \right\rangle }$ to ${\left\langle k^{3/2} \right\rangle }$, where ${\left\langle k \right\rangle }$ and ${\left\langle k^{3/2} \right\rangle }$ are the average degree and the $3/2$ order moment of degree distribution, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the finite size effect where the stochastic fluctuation should be involved. To the end, we derive the Langevin equation and obtain the potential of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. This allows us to calculate the effective critical noise $f_c(N)$ at which the susceptibility is maximal in finite size networks. We find that the $f_c-f_c(N)$ decays with $N$ in a power-law way and vanishes for $N\rightarrow \infty$. All the theoretical results are confirmed by performing the extensive Monte Carlo simulations in random $k$-regular networks, Erd\"os-R\'enyi random networks and scale-free networks.

010       Sensor-based Gait Parameter Extraction with Deep Convolutional Neural   Networks
021       Measurement of stride-related, biomechanical parameters is the common rationale for objective gait impairment scoring. 
020       State-of-the-art double integration approaches to extract these parameters from inertial sensor data are, however, limited in their clinical applicability due to the underlying assumptions. To overcome this, we present a method to translate the abstract information provided by wearable sensors to context-related expert features based on deep convolutional neural networks. Regarding mobile gait analysis, this enables integration-free and data-driven extraction of a set of 8 spatio-temporal stride parameters. To this end, two modelling approaches are compared: A combined network estimating all parameters of interest and an ensemble approach that spawns less complex networks for each parameter individually. The ensemble approach is outperforming the combined modelling in the current application. On a clinically relevant and publicly available benchmark dataset, we estimate stride length, width and medio-lateral change in foot angle up to ${-0.15\pm6.09}$ cm, ${-0.09\pm4.22}$ cm and ${0.13 \pm 3.78^\circ}$ respectively. Stride, swing and stance time as well as heel and toe contact times are estimated up to ${\pm 0.07}$, ${\pm0.05}$, ${\pm 0.07}$, ${\pm0.07}$ and ${\pm0.12}$ s respectively. This is comparable to and in parts outperforming or defining state-of-the-art. Our results further indicate that the proposed change in methodology could substitute assumption-driven double-integration methods and enable mobile assessment of spatio-temporal stride parameters in clinically critical situations as e.g. in the case of spastic gait impairments.

010       On Human Consciousness
021       We consider the implications of the mathematical analysis of neurone-to-neurone dynamical complex networks. 
020       We show how the dynamical behaviour of small scale strongly connected networks lead naturally to non-binary information processing and thus multiple hypothesis decision making, even at the very lowest level of the brain's architecture. In turn we build on these ideas to address the hard problem of consciousness. We discuss how a proposed "dual hierarchy model", made up form of both external perceived, physical, elements of increasing complexity, and internal mental elements (experiences), may support a leaning and evolving consciousness. We discuss the idea that a human brain ought to be able to re-conjure subjective mental feelings at will and thus these cannot depend on internal nose (chatter) or internal instability-driven activity. An immediate consequence of this model, grounded in dynamical systems and non-binary information processing, is that finite human brains must always be learning or forgetteing and that any possible subjective internal feeling that may be idealised with a countable infinity of facets, can never be learned by zombies or automata: though it can be experienced more and more fully by an evolving brain (yet never in totality, not even in a lifetime).

010       Dynamics of tax evasion through an epidemic-like model
021       In this work we study a model of tax evasion. 
020       We considered a fixed population divided in three compartments, namely honest tax payers, tax evaders and a third class between the mentioned two, which we call \textit{susceptibles} to become evaders. The transitions among those compartments are ruled by probabilities, similarly to a model of epidemic spreading. These probabilities model social interactions among the individuals, as well as the government's fiscalization. We simulate the model on fully-connected graphs, as well as on scale-free and random complex networks. For the fully-connected and random graph cases we observe that the emergence of tax evaders in the population is associated with an active-absorbing nonequilibrium phase transition, that is absent in scale-free networks.

010       Structural Bounds on the Dyadic Effect
021       In this paper we consider the dyadic effect introduced in complex networks when nodes are distinguished by a binary characteristic. 
020       Under these circumstances two independent parameters, namely dyadicity and heterophilicity, are able to measure how much the assigned characteristic affects the network topology. All possible configurations can be represented in a phase diagram lying in a two-dimensional space that represents the feasible region of the dyadic effect, which is bound by two upper bounds on dyadicity and heterophilicity. Using some network's structural arguments, we are able to improve such upper bounds and introduce two new lower bounds, providing a reduction of the feasible region of the dyadic effect as well as constraining dyadicity and heterophilicity within a specific range. Some computational experiences show the bounds' effectiveness and their usefulness with regards to different classes of networks.

010       Export dynamics as an optimal growth problem in the network of global   economy
021       We analyze export data aggregated at world global level of 219 classes of products over a period of 39 years. 
020       Our main goal is to set up a dynamical model to identify and quantify plausible mechanisms by which the evolutions of the various exports affect each other. This is pursued through a stochastic differential description, partly inspired by approaches used in population dynamics or directed polymers in random media. We outline a complex network of transfer rates which describes how resources are shifted between different product classes, and determines how casual favorable conditions for one export can spread to the other ones. A calibration procedure allows to fit four free model-parameters such that the dynamical evolution becomes consistent with the average growth, the fluctuations, and the ranking of the export values observed in real data. Growth crucially depends on the balance between maintaining and shifting resources to different exports, like in an explore-exploit problem. Remarkably, the calibrated parameters warrant a close-to-maximum growth rate under the transient conditions realized in the period covered by data, implying an optimal self organization of the global export. According to the model, major structural changes in the global economy take tens of years.

010       Asymptotic Analysis of Equivalences and Core-Structures in   Kronecker-Style Graph Models
021       Growing interest in modeling large, complex networks has spurred significant research into generative graph models. 
020       Kronecker-style models (SKG and R-MAT) are often used due to their scalability and ability to mimic key properties of real-world networks. Although a few papers theoretically establish these models' behavior for specific parameters, many claims used to justify their use are supported only empirically. In this work, we prove several results using asymptotic analysis which illustrate that empirical studies may not fully capture the true behavior of the models. <br />Paramount to the widespread adoption of Kronecker-style models was the introduction of a linear-time edge-sampling variant (R-MAT), which existing literature typically treats as interchangeable with SKG. We prove that although several R-MAT formulations are asymptotically equivalent, their behavior diverges from that of SKG. Further, we show these results are observable even at relatively small graph sizes. Second, we consider a case where asymptotic analysis reveals unexpected behavior within a given model.

010       Monitoring the energy consumed by a network infrastructure to detect and   isolate faults in communication architecture
021       In recent years, a number of major improvements were introduced in the area of computer networks, energy-efficient network protocols and network management systems. 
020       Software Defined Networking (SDN) as a new paradigm for managing complex networks brings a significant opportunity to reduce the energy consumption among ICT. In this paper, we are tackling improvements in the process of monitoring the states of the networking devices and optimizing the existing solutions. We are monitoring the energy consumption of a network architecture and augment the retrieved raw power data to detect changes in the state of the devices. The goal is to benchmark the difference between the power data fetched from the real-measures and the data extracted from the power models, translated as the expected behavior of the devices. An application is designed to monitor and analyze the retrieved power data of a simulated ICT infrastructure composed of Cisco switches and routers, Dell Precision stations and Raritan PDUs. Moreover, smart algorithms are developed which outcome results with detection of changes in the state of the devices, as well as with detection and isolation of possible anomalies and their impact on the energy consumption. The application is envisioned to be an extension to the existing SDN controllers for monitoring and reporting the changes in the state of the ICT devices.

010       Detecting highly cyclic structure with complex eigenpairs
021       Many large, real-world complex networks have rich community structure that a network scientist seeks to understand. 
020       These communities may overlap or have intricate internal structure. Extracting communities with particular topological structure, even when they overlap with other communities, is a powerful capability that would provide novel avenues of focusing in on structure of interest. In this work we consider extracting highly-cyclic regions of directed graphs (digraphs). We demonstrate that embeddings derived from complex-valued eigenvectors associated with stochastic propagator eigenvalues near roots of unity are well-suited for this purpose. We prove several fundamental theoretic results demonstrating the connection between these eigenpairs and the presence of highly-cyclic structure and we demonstrate the use of these vectors on a few real-world examples.

010       Katz Centrality of Markovian Temporal Networks: Analysis and   Optimization
021       Identifying important nodes in complex networks is a fundamental problem in network analysis. 
020       Although a plethora of measures has been proposed to identify important nodes in static (i.e., time-invariant) networks, there is a lack of tools in the context of temporal networks (i.e., networks whose connectivity dynamically changes over time). The aim of this paper is to propose a system-theoretic approach for identifying important nodes in temporal networks. In this direction, we first propose a generalization of the popular Katz centrality measure to the family of Markovian temporal networks using tools from the theory of Markov jump linear systems. We then show that Katz centrality in Markovian temporal networks can be efficiently computed using linear programming. Finally, we propose a convex program for optimizing the Katz centrality of a given node by tuning the weights of the temporal network in a cost-efficient manner. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

010       Balancing Speed and Coverage by Sequential Seeding in Complex Networks
021       Information spreading in complex networks is often modeled as diffusing information with certain probability from nodes that possess it to their neighbors that do not. 
020       Information cascades are triggered when the activation of a set of initial nodes (seeds) results in diffusion to large number of nodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the commonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation stages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding highly ranked nodes that are already activated by diffusion active between stages. The gain arises when a saved seed is allocated to a node difficult to reach via diffusion. Sequential seeding and a single stage approach are compared using various seed ranking methods and diffusion parameters on real complex networks. The experimental results indicate that, regardless of the seed ranking method used, sequential seeding strategies deliver better coverage than single stage seeding in about 90% of cases. Longer seeding sequences tend to activate more nodes but they also extend the duration of diffusion. Various variants of sequential seeding resolve the trade-off between the coverage and speed of diffusion differently.

010       Ignoring Extreme Opinions in Complex Networks: The Impact of   Heterogeneous Thresholds
021       We consider a class of opinion dynamics on networks where at each time-step, each node in the network disregards the opinions of a certain number of its most extreme neighbors and updates its own opinion as a weighted average of the remaining opinions. 
020       When all nodes disregard the same number of extreme neighbors, previous work has shown that consensus will be reached if and only if the network satisfies certain topological properties. In this paper, we consider the implications of allowing each node to have a personal threshold for the number of extreme neighbors to ignore. We provide graph conditions under which consensus is guaranteed for such dynamics. We then study random networks where each node's threshold is drawn from a certain distribution, and provide conditions on that distribution, together with conditions on the edge formation probability, that guarantee that consensus will be reached asymptotically almost surely.

021       We study the spread of discrete-time epidemics over arbitrary networks for well-known propagation models, namely SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible), SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered), SIRS (susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible) and SIV (susceptible-infected-vaccinated). 
020       Such epidemics are described by $2^n$- or $3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is too complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear "mean-field" approximation, and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination, the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the "true" underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field model, the Markov chain has an $O(\log n)$ mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly. We compare and summarize the results on different propagation models.

010       On the Modeling of Musical Solos as Complex Networks
021       Notes in a musical piece are building blocks employed in non-random ways to create melodies. 
020       It is the "interaction" among a limited amount of notes that allows constructing the variety of musical compositions that have been written in centuries and within different cultures. Networks are a modeling tool that is commonly employed to represent a set of entities interacting in some way. Thus, notes composing a melody can be seen as nodes of a network that are connected whenever these are played in sequence. The outcome of such a process results in a directed graph. By using complex network theory, some main metrics of musical graphs can be measured, which characterize the related musical pieces. In this paper, we define a framework to represent melodies as networks. Then, we provide an analysis on a set of guitar solos performed by main musicians. Results of this study indicate that the presented model can have an impact on audio and multimedia applications such as music classification, identification, e-learning, automatic music generation, multimedia entertainment.

010       Topological structure and the H-index in complex networks
021       The generalized $H(n)$ Hirsch index of order $n$ has been recently introduced and shown to interpolate between the degree and the $K$-core centrality in networks. 
020       We provide a detailed analytical characterization of the properties of sets of nodes having the same $H(n)$, within the annealed network approximation. The connection between the Hirsch indices and the degree is highlighted. Numerical tests in synthetic uncorrelated networks and real-world correlated ones validate the findings. We also test the use of the Hirsch index for the identification of influential spreaders in networks, finding that it is in general outperformed by the recently introduced Non-Backtracking centrality.

010       Explosive transitions in complex networks&#x27; structure and dynamics:   percolation and synchronization
021       Percolation and synchronization are two phase transitions that have been extensively studied since already long ago. 
020       A classic result is that, in the vast majority of cases, these transitions are of the second-order type, i.e. continuous and reversible. Recently, however, explosive phenomena have been reported in com- plex networks' structure and dynamics, which rather remind first-order (discontinuous and irreversible) transitions. Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in the network's structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks' dynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase oscillators were taken into consideration. The two phenomena have stimulated investigations and de- bates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So far, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental verifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural and dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations, as well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in networked systems. Our intention is to offer here a monographic review on the main-stream literature, with the twofold aim of summarizing the existing results and pointing out possible directions for future research.

010       Systematic evaluation of a new combinatorial curvature for complex   networks
021       We have recently introduced Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of complex networks. 
020       Forman curvature is an edge-based measure whose mathematical definition elegantly encapsulates the weights of nodes and edges in a complex network. In this contribution, we perform a comparative analysis of Forman curvature with other edge-based measures such as edge betweenness, embeddedness and dispersion in diverse model and real networks. We find that Forman curvature in comparison to embeddedness or dispersion is a better indicator of the importance of an edge for the large-scale connectivity of complex networks. Based on the definition of the Forman curvature of edges, there are two natural ways to define the Forman curvature of nodes in a network. In this contribution, we also examine these two possible definitions of Forman curvature of nodes in diverse model and real networks. Based on our empirical analysis, we find that in practice the unnormalized definition of the Forman curvature of nodes with the choice of combinatorial node weights is a better indicator of the importance of nodes in complex networks.

010       Validation of Twitter opinion trends with national polling aggregates:   Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump
021       Measuring and forecasting opinion trends from real-time social media is a long-standing goal of big-data analytics. 
020       Despite its importance, there has been no conclusive scientific evidence so far that social media activity can capture the opinion of the general population. Here we develop a method to infer the opinion of Twitter users regarding the candidates of the 2016 US Presidential Election by using a combination of statistical physics of complex networks and machine learning based on hashtags co-occurrence to develop an in-domain training set approaching 1 million tweets. We investigate the social networks formed by the interactions among millions of Twitter users and infer the support of each user to the presidential candidates. The resulting Twitter trends follow the New York Times National Polling Average, which represents an aggregate of hundreds of independent traditional polls, with remarkable accuracy. Moreover, the Twitter opinion trend precedes the aggregated NYT polls by 10 days, showing that Twitter can be an early signal of global opinion trends. Our analytics unleash the power of Twitter to uncover social trends from elections, brands to political movements, and at a fraction of the cost of national polls.

010       Hub induced remote synchronization and desynchronization in complex   networks of Kuramoto oscillators
021       The concept of "remote synchronization" (RS) was introduced in [Phys. 
020       Rev. E 85, 026208 (2012)], where synchronization in a star network of Stuart-Landau oscillators was investigated. In the RS regime therein described, the central hub served as a transmitter of information between peripheral nodes, while maintaining independent dynamics that were asynchronous with the rest of the network. One of the key conclusions of that paper was that RS cannot occur in pure phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that the RS regime can exist in networks of Kuramoto oscillators, and that hub nodes can actively drive remote synchronization even in the presence of a repulsive mean field. We apply this model to study the synchronization dynamics in complex networks endowed with hub-nodes, an ubiquitous feature of many natural networks. We show that a change in the natural frequency of a hub can alone reshape synchronization patterns, and switch from direct to remote synchronization, or to hub-driven desynchronization. We discuss the potential role of this phenomenon in real-world networks, including the Karate-club and brain connectivity networks.

010       Drop morphologies on flexible fibers: influence of elastocapillary   effects
021       Various materials are made of long thin fibers that are randomly oriented to form a complex network in which drops of wetting liquid tend to accumulate at the nodes. 
020       The capillary force exerted by the liquid can bend flexible fibers, which in turn influences the morphology adopted by the liquid. In this paper, we investigate, the role of the fiber flexibility on the shape of a small volume of liquid on a pair of crossed flexible fibers, through a model situation. We characterize the liquid morphologies as we vary the volume of liquid, the angle between the fibers, and the length of the fibers. The drop morphologies previously reported for rigid crossed fibers, i.e., a drop, a column and a mixed morphology, are also observed on flexible crossed fibers with modified domains of existence. In addition, at small tilting angles between the fibers, a new behavior is observed: the fibers bend and collapse. Depending on the volume of liquid, a thin column with or without a drop is reported on the collapsed fibers. Our study suggests that the fiber flexibility adds a rich variety of behaviors that may be important for some applications.

010       Navigation by anomalous random walks on complex networks
021       Anomalous random walks having long-range jumps are a critical branch of dynamical processes on networks, which can model a number of search and transport processes. 
020       However, traditional measurements based on mean first passage time are not useful as they fail to characterize the cost associated with each jump. Here we introduce a new concept of mean first traverse distance (MFTD) to characterize anomalous random walks that represents the expected traverse distance taken by walkers searching from source node to target node, and we provide a procedure for calculating the MFTD between two nodes. We use Levy walks on networks as an example, and demonstrate that the proposed approach can unravel the interplay between diffusion dynamics of Levy walks and the underlying network structure. Interestingly, applying our framework to the famous PageRank search, we can explain why its damping factor empirically chosen to be around 0.85. The framework for analyzing anomalous random walks on complex networks offers a new useful paradigm to understand the dynamics of anomalous diffusion processes, and provides a unified scheme to characterize search and transport processes on networks.

010       Mind Control as a Guide for the Mind
021       The human brain is a complex network that supports mental function. 
020       The nascent field of network neuroscience applies tools from mathematics to neuroimaging data in the hopes of shedding light on cognitive function. A critical question arising from these empirical studies is how to modulate a human brain network to treat cognitive deficits or enhance mental abilities. While historically a number of tools have been employed to modulate mental states (such as cognitive behavioral therapy and brain stimulation), theoretical frameworks to guide these interventions - and to optimize them for clinical use - are fundamentally lacking. One promising and as-yet underexplored approach lies in a sub-discipline of engineering known as network control theory. Here, we posit that network control fundamentally relates to mind control, and that this relationship highlights important areas for future empirical research and opportunities to translate knowledge in practical domains. We clarify the conceptual intersection between neuroanatomy, cognition, and control engineering in the context of network neuroscience. Finally, we discuss the challenges, ethics, and promises of mind control.

010       Spectral Inference Methods on Sparse Graphs: Theory and Applications
021       In an era of unprecedented deluge of (mostly unstructured) data, graphs are proving more and more useful, across the sciences, as a flexible abstraction to capture complex relationships between complex objects. 
020       One of the main challenges arising in the study of such networks is the inference of macroscopic, large-scale properties affecting a large number of objects, based solely on the microscopic interactions between their elementary constituents. Statistical physics, precisely created to recover the macroscopic laws of thermodynamics from an idealized model of interacting particles, provides significant insight to tackle such complex networks. <br />In this dissertation, we use methods derived from the statistical physics of disordered systems to design and study new algorithms for inference on graphs. Our focus is on spectral methods, based on certain eigenvectors of carefully chosen matrices, and sparse graphs, containing only a small amount of information. We develop an original theory of spectral inference based on a relaxation of various mean-field free energy optimizations. Our approach is therefore fully probabilistic, and contrasts with more traditional motivations based on the optimization of a cost function. We illustrate the efficiency of our approach on various problems, including community detection, randomized similarity-based clustering, and matrix completion.

010       Localized attack on clustering networks
021       Clustering network is one of which complex network attracting plenty of scholars to discuss and study the structures and cascading process. 
020       We primarily analyzed the effect of clustering coefficient to other various of the single clustering network under localized attack. These network models including double clustering network and star-like NON with clustering and random regular (RR) NON of ER networks with clustering are made up of at least two networks among which exist interdependent relation among whose degree of dependence is measured by coupling strength. We show both analytically and numerically, how the coupling strength and clustering coefficient effect the percolation threshold, size of giant component, critical coupling point where the behavior of phase transition changes from second order to first order with the increase of coupling strength between the networks. Last, we study the two types of clustering network: one type is same with double clustering network in which each subnetwork satisfies identical degree distribution and the other is that their subnetwork satisfies different degree distribution. The former type is treated both analytically and numerically while the latter is treated only numerically. In each section, we compared two results obtained from localized attack and random attack according to Shao et al:[22].

010       Sensitivity of Complex Networks
021       The sensitivity (i.e. dynamic response) of complex networked systems has not been well understood, making difficult to predict whether new macroscopic dynamic behavior will emerge even if we know exactly how individual nodes behave and how they are coupled. 
020       Here we build a framework to quantify the sensitivity of complex networked system of coupled dynamic units. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for the emergence of new macroscopic dynamic behavior in the thermodynamic limit. We prove that these conditions are satisfied only for architectures with power-law degree distributions. Surprisingly, we find that highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs) only dominate the sensitivity of the network up to certain critical frequency.

020       In the previous work (Xu et al, 2016 \cite{xu2016}), we measure the contribution of a path in link prediction with information entropy. In this paper, we further quantify the contribution of a path with both path entropy and path weight, and propose a weighted prediction index based on the contributions of paths, namely Weighted Path Entropy (WPE), to improve the prediction accuracy in weighted networks. Empirical experiments on six weighted real-world networks show that WPE achieves higher prediction accuracy than three typical weighted indices.

010       Resilience of epidemics on networks
021       Epidemic propagation on complex networks has been widely investigated, mostly with invariant parameters. 
020       However, the process of epidemic propagation is not always constant. Epidemics can be affected by various perturbations, and may bounce back to its original state, which is considered resilient. Here, we study the resilience of epidemics on networks, by introducing a different infection rate ${\lambda_{2}}$ during SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) epidemic propagation to model perturbations (control state), whereas the infection rate is ${\lambda_{1}}$ in the rest of time. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that even for ${\lambda_{2}&lt;\lambda_{c}}$, epidemics eventually could bounce back if control duration is below a threshold. This critical control time for epidemic resilience, i.e., ${cd_{max}}$ can be predicted by the diameter (${d}$) of the underlying network, with the quantitative relation ${cd_{max}\sim d^{\alpha}}$. Our findings can help to design a better mitigation strategy for epidemics.

010       Nonlinear Structural Vector Autoregressive Models for Inferring   Effective Brain Network Connectivity
021       Structural equation models (SEMs) and vector autoregressive models (VARMs) are two broad families of approaches that have been shown useful in effective brain connectivity studies. 
020       While VARMs postulate that a given region of interest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that causal dependencies arise due to contemporaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are not necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary perspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that leverage both contemporaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put forth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they are incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series. To this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably broaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels, which have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in canonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and dimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here to the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient regularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to real-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected dictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach. Extensive numerical tests on ECoG data captured through a study on epileptic seizures demonstrate that it is possible to unveil previously unknown causal links between brain regions of interest.

010       Unveiling the Multi-fractal Structure of Complex Networks
021       The fractal nature of graphs has traditionally been investigated by using the nodes of networks as the basic units. 
020       Here, instead, we propose to concentrate on the graph edges, and introduce a practical and computationally not demanding method for revealing changes in the fractal behavior of networks, and particularly for allowing distinction between mono-fractal, quasi mono-fractal, and multi-fractal structures. We show that degree homogeneity plays a crucial role in determining the fractal nature of the underlying network, and report on six different protein-protein interaction networks along with their corresponding random networks. Our analysis allows to identify varying levels of complexity in the species.

010       Representation Learning with Deconvolution for Multivariate Time Series   Classification and Visualization
021       We propose a new model based on the deconvolutional networks and SAX discretization to learn the representation for multivariate time series. 
020       Deconvolutional networks fully exploit the advantage the powerful expressiveness of deep neural networks in the manner of unsupervised learning. We design a network structure specifically to capture the cross-channel correlation with deconvolution, forcing the pooling operation to perform the dimension reduction along each position in the individual channel. Discretization based on Symbolic Aggregate Approximation is applied on the feature vectors to further extract the bag of features. We show how this representation and bag of features helps on classification. A full comparison with the sequence distance based approach is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard datasets. We further build the Markov matrix from the discretized representation from the deconvolution to visualize the time series as complex networks, which show more class-specific statistical properties and clear structures with respect to different labels.

010       Encoding Temporal Markov Dynamics in Graph for Time Series Visualization
021       Time series is attracting more attention across statistics, machine learning and pattern recognition as it appears widely in both industry and academia, but few advances have been achieved in effective time series visualization due to its temporal dimensionality and complex dynamics. 
020       Inspired by recent effort on using network metrics to characterize time series for classification, we present an approach to visualize time series as complex networks based on the first order Markov process in its temporal ordering. In contrast to the classical bar charts, line plots and other statistics based graph, our approach delivers more intuitive visualization that better preserves both the temporal dependency and frequency structures. It provides a natural inverse operation to map the graph back to time series, making it possible to use graph statistics to characterize time series for better visual exploration and statistical analysis. Our experimental results suggest the effectiveness on various tasks such as system identification, pattern mining and classification on both synthetic and the real time series data.

010       Generic Anomalous Vertices Detection Utilizing a Link Prediction   Algorithm
021       In the past decade, network structures have penetrated nearly every aspect of our lives. 
020       The detection of anomalous vertices in these networks has become increasingly important, such as in exposing computer network intruders or identifying fake online reviews. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised two-layered meta-classifier that can detect irregular vertices in complex networks solely by using features extracted from the network topology. Following the reasoning that a vertex with many improbable links has a higher likelihood of being anomalous,we employed our method on 10 networks of various scales, from a network of several dozen students to online social networks with millions of users. In every scenario, we were able to identify anomalous vertices with lower false positive rates and higher AUCs compared to other prevalent methods. Moreover, we demonstrated that the presented algorithm is efficient both in revealing fake users and in disclosing the most influential people in social networks.

010       Exact probabilities for the indeterminacy of complex networks as   perceived through press perturbations
021       We consider the goal of predicting how complex networks respond to chronic (press) perturbations when characterizations of their network topology and interaction strengths are associated with uncertainty. 
020       Our primary result is the derivation of exact formulas for the expected number and probability of qualitatively incorrect predictions about a system's responses under uncertainties drawn form arbitrary distributions of error. These formulas obviate the current use of simulations, algorithms, and qualitative modeling techniques. Additional indices provide new tools for identifying which links in a network are most qualitatively and quantitatively sensitive to error, and for determining the volume of errors within which predictions will remain qualitatively determinate (i.e. sign insensitive). Together with recent advances in the empirical characterization of uncertainty in ecological networks, these tools bridge a way towards probabilistic predictions of network dynamics.

010       Simplification of inclusion-exclusion on intersections of unions with   application to network systems reliability
021       Reliability of safety-critical systems is an important issue in system engineering and in most practical situations the reliability of a non series-parallel network system has to be calculated. 
020       Some methods for calculating reliability use the probability principle of inclusion-exclusion. When dealing with complex networks, this leads to very long mathematical expressions which are usually computationally very expensive to calculate. In this paper, we provide a new expression to simplify the probability principle of inclusion-exclusion's formula for intersections of unions, which appear when calculating reliability on non series parallel network systems. This new expression has much less terms, which reduces enormously the computational cost. We also show that the general form of the probability principle of inclusion-exclusion's formula has double exponential complexity whereas the simplified form has only exponential complexity with a linear exponent. Finally, we illustrate how to use this result when calculating the reliability of a door management system in aircraft engineering.

010       Long-range Correlation and Market Segmentation in Bond Market
021       This paper looks into the analysis of the long-range auto-correlations and cross-correlations in bond market. 
020       Based on Detrended Moving Average (DMA) method, empirical results present a clear evidence of long-range persistence that exists in one year scale. The degree of long-range correlation related to maturities has an upward tendency with a peak in short term. These findings confirm the expectations of fractal market hypothesis (FMH). Furthermore, we have developed a method based on a complex network to study the long-range cross-correlation structure and apply it to our data, and found a clear pattern of market segmentation in the long run. We also detected the nature of long-range correlation in the sub-period 2007 to 2012 and 2011 to 2016. The result from our research shows that long-range auto-correlations are decreasing in the recent years while long-range cross-correlations are strengthening.

010       Folding with a protein&#x27;s native shortcut network
021       A complex network approach to protein folding is proposed. 
020       The graph object is the network of shortcut edges present in a native-state protein (SCN0). Although SCN0s are found via an intuitive message passing algorithm (S. Milgram, Psychology Today, May 1967 pp. 61-67), they are meaningful enough that the logarithm form of their contact order (SCN0_lnCO) correlates significantly with protein kinetic rates, regardless of protein size. Further, the clustering coefficient of a SCN0 (CSCN0) can be used to combine protein segments iteratively within the Restricted Binary Collision model to form the whole native structure. This simple yet surprisingly effective strategy identified reasonable folding pathways for 12 small single-domain two-state folders, and three non-canonical proteins: ACBP (non-two-state), Top7 (non-cooperative) and DHFR (non-single-domain, &gt; 100 residues). For two-state folders, CSCN0 is relatable to folding rates, transition-state placement and stability. The influence of CSCN0 on folding extends to non-native structures. Moreover, SCN analysis of non-native structures could suggest three fold success factors for the fast folding Villin headpiece peptide. These results support the view of protein folding as a bottom-up hierarchical process guided from above by native-state topology, and could facilitate future constructive demonstrations of this long held hypothesis for larger proteins.

010       Community Detection in Complex Networks using Link Prediction
021       Community detection and link prediction are both of great significance in network analysis, which provide very valuable insights into topological structures of the network from different perspectives. 
020       In this paper, we propose a novel community detection algorithm with inclusion of link prediction, motivated by the question whether link prediction can be devoted to improving the accuracy of community partition. For link prediction, we propose two novel indices to compute the similarity between each pair of nodes, one of which aims to add missing links, and the other tries to remove spurious edges. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark data sets, and the results of our proposed algorithm are compared with two classes of baseline. In conclusion, our proposed algorithm is competitive, revealing that link prediction does improve the precision of community detection.

010       Shannon entropy of brain functional complex networks under the influence   of the psychedelic Ayahuasca
021       The entropic brain hypothesis holds that the key facts concerning psychedelics are partially explained in terms of increased entropy of the brain's functional connectivity. 
020       Ayahuasca is a psychedelic beverage of Amazonian indigenous origin with legal status in Brazil in religious and scientific settings. In this context, we use tools and concepts from the theory of complex networks to analyze resting state fMRI data of the brains of human subjects under two distinct conditions: (i) under ordinary waking state and (ii) in an altered state of consciousness induced by ingestion of Ayahuasca. We report an increase in the Shannon entropy of the degree distribution of the networks subsequent to Ayahuasca ingestion. We also find increased local and decreased global network integration. Our results are broadly consistent with the entropic brain hypothesis. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of descriptions of "mind-expansion" frequently seen in self-reports of users of psychedelic drugs.

010       Inferring Coupling of Distributed Dynamical Systems via Transfer Entropy
021       In this work, we are interested in structure learning for a set of spatially distributed dynamical systems, where individual subsystems are coupled via latent variables and observed through a filter. 
020       We represent this model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that characterises the unidirectional coupling between subsystems. Standard approaches to structure learning are not applicable in this framework due to the hidden variables, however we can exploit the properties of certain dynamical systems to formulate exact methods based on state space reconstruction. We approach the problem by using reconstruction theorems to analytically derive a tractable expression for the KL-divergence of a candidate DAG from the observed dataset. We show this measure can be decomposed as a function of two information-theoretic measures, transfer entropy and stochastic interaction. We then present two mathematically robust scoring functions based on transfer entropy and statistical independence tests. These results support the previously held conjecture that transfer entropy can be used to infer effective connectivity in complex networks.

010       Bridges in Complex Networks
021       A bridge in a graph is an edge whose removal disconnects the graph and increases the number of connected components. 
020       We calculate the fraction of bridges in a wide range of real-world networks and their randomized counterparts. We find that real networks typically have more bridges than their completely randomized counterparts, but very similar fraction of bridges as their degree-preserving randomizations. We define a new edge centrality measure, called bridgeness, to quantify the importance of a bridge in damaging a network. We find that certain real networks have very large average and variance of bridgeness compared to their degree-preserving randomizations and other real networks. Finally, we offer an analytical framework to calculate the bridge fraction , the average and variance of bridgeness for uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions.

010       Graph spectral characterisation of the XY model on complex networks
021       There is recent evidence that the $XY$ spin model on complex networks can display three different macroscopic states in response to the topology of the network underpinning the interactions of the spins. 
020       In this work, we present a novel way to characterise the macroscopic states of the $XY$ spin model based on the spectral decomposition of time series using topological information about the underlying networks. We use three different classes of networks to generate time series of the spins for the three possible macroscopic states. We then use the temporal Graph Signal Transform technique to decompose the time series of the spins on the eigenbasis of the Laplacian. From this decomposition, we produce spatial power spectra, which summarise the activation of structural modes by the non-linear dynamics, and thus coherent patterns of activity of the spins. These signatures of the macroscopic states are independent of the underlying networks and can thus be used as universal signatures for the macroscopic states. This work opens new avenues to analyse and characterise dynamics on complex networks using temporal Graph Signal Analysis.

010       Research on Life Characteristics of Internet Based on Network Motifs
021       From biosystem to complex system,the study of life is always an important area. 
020       Inspired by hyper-cycle theory about the evolution of non-life system, we study the metabolism, self-replication and mutation behavior in the Internet based on node entity, connection relationship and function subgraph--motif--of network topology. Firstly a framework of complex network evolution is proposed to analyze the birth and death phenomena of Internet topology from January 1998 to August 2013. Then we find the Internet metabolism behavior from angle of node, motif to global topology, i.e. one born node is only added into Internet, subsequently takes part in the local reconstruction activities. Meanwhile there are nodes' and motifs' death. In process of the local reconstruction, although the Internet system replicates motifs repeatedly by adding or removing actions, the system characteristics and global structure are not destroyed. Statistics about the motif M3 which is a full connectivity subgraph shows that the process of its metabolism is fluctuation that causes mutation of Internet. Furthermore we find that mutation is instinctive reaction of Internet when it's influenced from inside or outside environment, such as Internet bubble, social network rising and finance crisis. The behaviors of metabolism, self-replication and mutation of Internet indicate its life characteristic as a complex artificial life. And our work will inspire people to study the life-like phenomena of other complex systems from angle of topology structure.

010       Universal structural estimator and dynamics approximator for complex   networks
021       Revealing the structure and dynamics of complex networked systems from observed data is of fundamental importance to science, engineering, and society. 
020       Is it possible to develop a universal, completely data driven framework to decipher the network structure and different types of dynamical processes on complex networks, regardless of their details? We develop a Markov network based model, sparse dynamical Boltzmann machine (SDBM), as a universal network structural estimator and dynamics approximator. The SDBM attains its topology according to that of the original system and is capable of simulating the original dynamical process. We develop a fully automated method based on compressive sensing and machine learning to find the SDBM. We demonstrate, for a large variety of representative dynamical processes on model and real world complex networks, that the equivalent SDBM can recover the network structure of the original system and predicts its dynamical behavior with high precision.

021       We present an algorithmic method for analyzing networks of intersections with static signaling, with as primary example a line network that allows traffic flow over several intersections in one main direction. 
020       The method decomposes the network into separate intersections and treats each intersection in isolation using an extension of the fixed-cycle traffic-light (FCTL) queue. The network effects are modeled by matching the output process of one intersection with the input process of the next (downstream) intersection. This network analysis provides insight into wave phenomena due to vehicles experiencing progressive cascades of green lights and sheds light on platoon forming in case of imperfections. Our algorithm is shown to match results from extensive discrete-event simulations and can also be applied to more complex network structures.

010       Dynamical signatures of structural connectivity damage to a model of the   brain posed at criticality
021       Synchronization of brain activity fluctuations is believed to represent communication between spatially distant neural processes. 
020       These inter-areal functional interactions develop in the background of a complex network of axonal connections linking cortical and sub-cortical neurons, termed the human "structural connectome". Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence support the view that the human brain can be modeled as a system operating at a critical point between ordered (sub-critical) and disordered (super-critical) phases. Here, we explore the hypothesis that pathologies resulting from brain injury of different etiology are related to the model of a critical brain. For this purpose, we investigate how damage to the integrity of the structural connectome impacts on the signatures of critical dynamics. Adopting a hybrid modeling approach combining an empirical weighted network of human structural connections with a conceptual model of critical dynamics, we show that lesions located at highly transited connections progressively displace the model towards the sub-critical regime. The topological properties of the nodes and links are of less importance when considered independently of their weight in the network. We observe that damage to midline hubs such as the middle and posterior cingulate cortex is most crucial for the disruption of criticality in the model. However, a similar effect can be achieved by targeting less transited nodes and links whose connection weights add up to an equivalent amount. This implies that brain pathology does not necessarily arise due to insult targeted at well-connected areas and that inter- subject variability could obscure lesions located at non-hub regions. Finally, we discuss the predictions of our model in the context of clinical studies of traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

We ultimately plan on using REDRAW to infer the interaction structure in human ensembles engaged in coordination tasks, and give insights into the overall behavior.

010       Pion Fluctuation in High Energy Collisions - A Chaos-based Quantitative   Estimation with Visibility Graph Technique
021       We propose a new approach for studying pion fluctuation for deeper understanding of the dynamical process involved, from a perspective of fBm-based complex network analysis method called Visibility graph Analysis. 
020       This chaos-based, rigorous, non-linear technique is applied to study the erratic behavior of multipion production in \pi^{-}-Ag/Br interactions at 350 GeV. This method can offer reliable results with finite data points. The Power of Scale-freeness of Visibility Graph denoted by-PSVG is a measure of fractality, which can be used as a quantitative parameter for the assessment of the state of a chaotic system. The event-wise fluctuation of the multipion production process can be described by this parameter-PSVG. From the analysis of the PSVG parameter, we can quantitatively confirm that fractal behavior of the particle production process depends on the target excitation and also the fractality decreases with the increase of target excitation.

010       Collective navigation of complex networks: Participatory greedy routing
021       Many networks are used to transfer information or goods, in other words, they are navigated. 
020       The larger the network, the more difficult it is to navigate efficiently. Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious scalability problems due to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise of the Internet of Things. Large networks like the Internet can be navigated efficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden maps underlying these systems. However, in reality most agents will deny to forward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design appropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability? Here, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by successful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability can emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we show that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who participate in the navigation. This organizational principle can be exploited to favor the emergence of global navigability in the system.

010       Comparison of Brain Networks with Unknown Correspondences
021       Graph theory has drawn a lot of attention in the field of Neuroscience during the last decade, mainly due to the abundance of tools that it provides to explore the interactions of elements in a complex network like the brain. 
020       The local and global organization of a brain network can shed light on mechanisms of complex cognitive functions, while disruptions within the network can be linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this effort, the construction of a representative brain network for each individual is critical for further analysis. Additionally, graph comparison is an essential step for inference and classification analyses on brain graphs. In this work we explore a method based on graph edit distance for evaluating graph similarity, when correspondences between network elements are unknown due to different underlying subdivisions of the brain. We test this method on 30 unrelated subjects as well as 40 twin pairs and show that this method can accurately reflect the higher similarity between two related networks compared to unrelated ones, while identifying node correspondences.

010       Morphological Inversion of Complex Diffusion
021       Epidemics, neural cascades, power failures, and many other phenomena can be described by a diffusion process on a network. 
020       To identify the causal origins of a spread, it is often necessary to identify the triggering initial node. Here we define a new morphological operator and use it to detect the origin of a diffusive front, given the final state of a complex network. Our method performs better than randomized trials as well as centrality based methods. More importantly, our method is applicable regardless of the specifics of the forward model, and therefore can be applied to a wide range of systems such as identifying the patient zero in an epidemic, pinpointing the neuron that triggers a cascade, identifying the original malfunction that causes a catastrophic infrastructure failure, and inferring the ancestral species from which a heterogeneous population evolves.

010       Consecutive partitions of social networks between rivaling leaders
021       A model algorithm is proposed to study subsequent partitions of complex networks describing social structures. 
020       The partitions are supposed to appear as actions of rivaling leaders corresponding to nodes with large degrees. The condition of a partition is that the distance between two leaders is at least three links. This ensures that the layer of nearest neighbours of each leader remains attached to him. As a rule, numerically calculated size distribution of fragments of scale-free Albert-Barabasi networks reveals one large fragment which contains the original leader (hub of the network), and a number of small fragments with opponents that are described by two Weibull distributions. Numerical simulations and mean-field theory reveal that size of the larger fragment scales as the square root of the initial network size. The algorithm is applied to the data on political blogs in U.S. (L. Adamic and N. Glance, Proc. WWW-2005). The obtained fragments are clearly polarized; either they belong to Democrats, or to the GOP.

010       A decomposition algorithm for computing income taxes with pass-through   entities and its application to the Chilean case
021       Income tax systems with pass-through entities transfer a firm's incomes to the shareholders, which are taxed individually. 
020       In 2014, a Chilean tax reform introduced this type of entity and changed to an accrual basis that distributes incomes (but not losses) to shareholders. A crucial step for the Chilean taxation authority is to compute the final income of each individual, given the complex network of corporations and companies, usually including cycles between them. In this paper, we show the mathematical conceptualization and the solution to the problem, proving that there is only one way to distribute incomes to taxpayers. Using the theory of absorbing Markov chains, we define a mathematical model for computing the taxable incomes of each taxpayer, and we propose a decomposition algorithm for this problem. This allows us to compute the solution accurately and with the efficient use of computational resources. Finally, we present some characteristics of the Chilean taxpayers' network and computational results of the algorithm using this network.

010       A perturbative approach to Lagrangian flow networks
021       Complex network approaches have been successfully applied for studying transport processes in complex systems ranging from road, railway or airline infrastructure over industrial manufacturing to fluid dynamics. 
020       Here, we utilize a generic framework for describing the dynamics of geophysical flows such as ocean currents or atmospheric wind fields in terms of Lagrangian flow networks. In this approach, information on the passive advection of particles is transformed into a Markov chain based on transition probabilities of particles between the volume elements of a given partition of space for a fixed time step. We employ perturbation-theoretic methods to investigate the effects of modifications of transport processes in the underlying flow for three different problem classes: efficient absorption (corresponding to particle trapping or leaking), constant input of particles (with additional source terms modeling, e.g., localized contamination), and shifts of the steady state under probability mass conservation (as arising if the background flow is perturbed itself). Our results demonstrate that in all three cases, changes to the steady state solution can be analytically expressed in terms of the eigensystem of the unperturbed flow and the perturbation itself. These results are potentially relevant for developing more efficient strategies for coping with contaminations of fluid or gaseous media such as ocean and atmosphere by oil spills, radioactive substances, non-reactive chemicals or volcanic aerosols.

010       Percolation framework to describe El Ni\~no conditions
021       Complex networks have been used intensively to investigate the flow and dynamics of many natural systems including the climate system. 
020       Here, we develop a percolation based measure, the order parameter, to study and quantify climate networks. We find that abrupt transitions of the order parameter usually occur $\sim$1 year before El Ni\~{n}o ~ events, suggesting that they can be used as early warning precursors of El Ni\~{n}o. Using this method we analyze several reanalysis datasets and show the potential for good forecasting of El Ni\~{n}o. The percolation based order parameter exhibits discontinuous features, indicating possible relation to the first order phase transition mechanism.

010       Epidemic spreading on complex networks with community structures
021       Many real-world networks display a community structure. 
020       We study two random graph models that create a network with similar community structure as a given network. One model preserves the exact community structure of the original network, while the other model only preserves the set of communities and the vertex degrees. These models show that community structure is an important determinant of the behavior of percolation processes on networks, such as information diffusion or virus spreading: the community structure can both \textit{enforce} as well as \textit{inhibit} diffusion processes. Our models further show that it is the mesoscopic set of communities that matters. The exact internal structures of communities barely influence the behavior of percolation processes across networks. This insensitivity is likely due to the relative denseness of the communities.

010       Time-Varying Control Scheduling in Complex Dynamical Networks
021       Despite extensive research and remarkable advancements in the control of complex networks, time-invariant control schedules (TICS) still dominate the literature. 
020       This is both due to their simplicity and the fact that the potential benefits of time-varying control schedules (TVCS) have remained largely uncharacterized. Yet, TVCS have the potential to significantly enhance network controllability over TICS, especially when applied to large networks. In this paper we study networks with linear and discrete-time dynamics and analyze the role of network structure in TVCS. Through the analysis of a new scale-dependent notion of nodal communicability, we show that optimal TVCS involves the actuation of the most central nodes at appropriate spatial scales at all times. Consequently, we show that it is the scale-heterogeneity of the central-nodes in a network that determine whether, and to what extent, TVCS outperforms conventional policies based on TICS. Several analytical results and numerical examples support and illustrate this relationship.

010       Community-enhanced Network Representation Learning for Network Analysis
021       Network representation learning (NRL) aims to build low-dimensional vectors for vertices in a network. 
020       Most existing NRL methods focus on learning representations from local context of vertices (such as their neighbors). Nevertheless, vertices in many complex networks also exhibit significant global patterns widely known as communities. It's a common sense that vertices in the same community tend to connect densely, and usually share common attributes. These patterns are expected to improve NRL and benefit relevant evaluation tasks, such as link prediction and vertex classification. In this work, we propose a novel NRL model by introducing community information of vertices to learn more discriminative network representations, named as Community-enhanced Network Representation Learning (CNRL). CNRL simultaneously detects community distribution of each vertex and learns embeddings of both vertices and communities. In this way, we can obtain more informative representation of a vertex accompanying with its community information. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed CNRL model on vertex classification, link prediction, and community detection using several real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that CNRL significantly and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the detected meaningful communities verify our assumptions on the correlations among vertices, sequences, and communities.

010       RhoanaNet Pipeline: Dense Automatic Neural Annotation
021       Reconstructing a synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome, from electron microscopy (EM) images of brain tissue currently requires many hours of manual annotation or proofreading (Kasthuri and Lichtman, 2010; Lichtman and Sanes, 2008; Seung, 2009). 
020       The desire to reconstruct ever larger and more complex networks has pushed the collection of ever larger EM datasets. A cubic millimeter of raw imaging data would take up 1 PB of storage and present an annotation project that would be impractical without relying heavily on automatic segmentation methods. The RhoanaNet image processing pipeline was developed to automatically segment large volumes of EM data and ease the burden of manual proofreading and annotation. Based on (Kaynig et al., 2015), we updated every stage of the software pipeline to provide better throughput performance and higher quality segmentation results. We used state of the art deep learning techniques to generate improved membrane probability maps, and Gala (Nunez-Iglesias et al., 2014) was used to agglomerate 2D segments into 3D objects. <br />We applied the RhoanaNet pipeline to four densely annotated EM datasets, two from mouse cortex, one from cerebellum and one from mouse lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). All training and test data is made available for benchmark comparisons. The best segmentation results obtained gave $V^\text{Info}_\text{F-score}$ scores of 0.9054 and 09182 for the cortex datasets, 0.9438 for LGN, and 0.9150 for Cerebellum. <br />The RhoanaNet pipeline is open source software. All source code, training data, test data, and annotations for all four benchmark datasets are available at www.rhoana.org.

010       The many facets of community detection in complex networks
021       Community detection, the decomposition of a graph into essential building blocks, has been a core research topic in network science over the past years. 
020       Since a precise notion of what constitutes a community has remained evasive, community detection algorithms have often been compared on benchmark graphs with a particular form of assortative community structure and classified based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise different goals and reasons for why we want to employ community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these different motivations that underpin community detection. This problem-driven classification is useful in applied network science, where it is important to select an appropriate algorithm for the given purpose. Moreover, highlighting the different facets of community detection also delineates the many lines of research and points out open directions and avenues for future research.

010       Evolving Network Model that Almost Regenerates Epileptic Data
021       In many realistic networks, the edges representing the interactions between the nodes are time-varying. 
020       There is growing evidence that the complex network that models the dynamics of the human brain has time-varying interconnections, i.e., the network is evolving. Based on this evidence, we construct a patient and data specific evolving network model (comprising discrete-time dynamical systems) in which epileptic seizures or their terminations in the brain are also determined by the nature of the time-varying interconnections between the nodes. A novel and unique feature of our methodology is that the evolving network model remembers the data from which it was conceived from, in the sense that it evolves to almost regenerate the patient data even upon presenting an arbitrary initial condition to it. We illustrate a potential utility of our methodology by constructing an evolving network from clinical data that aids in identifying an approximate seizure focus -- nodes in such a theoretically determined seizure focus are outgoing hubs that apparently act as spreaders of seizures. We also point out the efficacy of removal of such spreaders in limiting seizures.

010       Predicting the rise of right-wing populism in response to unbalanced   immigration
021       Among the central tenets of globalization is free migration of labor. 
020       Although much has been written about its benefits, little is known about the limitations of globalization, including how immigration affects the anti-globalist sentiment. Analyzing polls data, we find that over the last three years in a group of EU countries affected by the recent migrant crisis, the percentage of right-wing (RW) populist voters in a given country depends on the prevalence of immigrants in this country's population and the total immigration inflow into the entire EU. The latter is likely due to the EU resembling a supranational state, where the lack of inner borders causes that "somebody else's problem" easily turns into "my problem". We further find that the increase in the percentage of RW voters substantially surpasses the immigration inflow, implying that if this process continues, RW populism may democratically prevail and eventually lead to a demise of globalization. We present evidence for tipping points in relation to the rise of RW populism. Finally, we model these empirical findings using a complex network framework wherein the success of globalization largely rests on the balance between immigration and immigrant integration.

010       Not Call Me Cellular Any More: The Emergence of Scaling Law, Fractal   Patterns and Small-World in Wireless Networks
021       In conventional cellular networks, for base stations (BSs) that are deployed far away from each other, it is general to assume them to be mutually independent. 
020       Nevertheless, after long-term evolution of cellular networks in various generations, this assumption no longer holds. Instead, the BSs, which seem to be gradually deployed by operators in a service-oriented manner, have embedded many fundamentally distinctive features in their locations, coverage and traffic loading. These features can be leveraged to analyze the intrinsic pattern in BSs and even human community. In this paper, according to large-scale measurement datasets, we build up a correlation model of BSs by utilizing one of the most important features, ie., spatial traffic. Coupling with the theory of complex networks, we make further analysis on the structure and characteristics of this traffic load correlation model. Numerical results show that the degree distribution follows scale-free property. Also the datasets unveil the characteristics of fractality and small-world. Furthermore, we apply collective influence (CI) algorithm to localize the influential base stations and demonstrate that some low-degree BSs may outrank BSs with larger degree.

010       Estimating latent feature-feature interactions in large feature-rich   graphs
021       Real-world complex networks describe connections between objects; in reality, those objects are often endowed with some kind of features. 
020       How does the presence or absence of such features interplay with the network link structure? Although the situation here described is truly ubiquitous, there is a limited body of research dealing with large graphs of this kind. Many previous works considered homophily as the only possible transmission mechanism translating node features into links. Other authors, instead, developed more sophisticated models, that are able to handle complex feature interactions, but are unfit to scale to very large networks. We expand on the MGJ model, where interactions between pairs of features can foster or discourage link formation. In this work, we will investigate how to estimate the latent feature-feature interactions in this model. We shall propose two solutions: the first one assumes feature independence and it is essentially based on Naive Bayes; the second one, which relaxes the independence assumption assumption, is based on perceptrons. In fact, we show it is possible to cast the model equation in order to see it as the prediction rule of a perceptron. We analyze how classical results for the perceptrons can be interpreted in this context; then, we define a fast and simple perceptron-like algorithm for this task, which can process $10^8$ links in minutes. We then compare these two techniques, first with synthetic datasets that follows our model, gaining evidence that the Naive independence assumptions are detrimental in practice. Secondly, we consider a real, large-scale citation network where each node (i.e., paper) can be described by different types of characteristics; there, our algorithm can assess how well each set of features can explain the links, and thus finding meaningful latent feature-feature interactions.

010       Interacting opinion and disease dynamics in multiplex networks:   discontinuous phase transition and non-monotonic consensus times
021       Opinion formation and disease spreading are among the most studied dynamical processes on complex networks. 
020       In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction $q$ of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both, the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling $q$ overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies non-monotonically with $q$ in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.

010       A Unified Method of Detecting Core-Periphery Structure and Community   Structure in Networks
021       Core-periphery structure and community structure are two typical meso-scale structures in complex networks. 
020       Though the community detection has been extensively investigated from different perspectives, the definition and the detection of core-periphery structure have not received much attention. Furthermore, the detection problems of the core-periphery and community structure were separately investigated. In this paper, we develop a unified framework to simultaneously detect core-periphery structure and community structure in complex networks. Moreover, there are several extra advantages of our algorithm: our method can detect not only single but also multiple pairs of core-periphery structures; the overlapping nodes belonging to different communities can be identified; different scales of core-periphery structures can be detected by adjusting the size of core. The good performance of the method has been validated on synthetic and real complex networks. So we provide a basic framework to detect the two typical meso-scale structures: core-periphery structure and community structure.

010       How structure sculpts function: unveiling the contribution of anatomical   connectivity to the brain&#x27;s spontaneous correlation structure
021       Intrinsic brain activity is characterized by highly structured co-activations between different regions, whose origin is still under debate. 
020       In this paper, we address the question whether it is possible to unveil how the underlying anatomical connectivity shape the brain's spontaneous correlation structure. We start from the assumption that in order for two nodes to exhibit large covariation, they must be exposed to similar input patterns from the entire network. We then acknowledge that information rarely spreads only along an unique route, but rather travels along all possible paths. In real networks the strength of local perturbations tends to decay as they propagate away from the sources, leading to a progressive attenuation of the original information content and, thus, of their influence. We use these notions to derive a novel analytical measure, $\mathcal{T}$ , which quantifies the similarity of the whole-network input patterns arriving at any two nodes only due to the underlying topology, in what is a generalization of the matching index. We show that this measure of topological similarity can indeed be used to predict the contribution of network topology to the expected correlation structure, thus unveiling the mechanism behind the tight but elusive relationship between structure and function in complex networks. Finally, we use this measure to investigate brain connectivity, showing that information about the topology defined by the complex fabric of brain axonal pathways specifies to a large extent the time-average functional connectivity observed at rest.

010       Community detection by label propagation with compression of flow
021       The label propagation algorithm (LPA) has been proved to be a fast and effective method for detecting communities in large complex networks. 
020       However, its performance is subject to the non-stable and trivial solutions of the problem. In this paper, we propose a modified label propagation algorithm LPAf to efficiently detect community structures in networks. Instead of the majority voting rule of the basic LPA, LPAf updates the label of a node by considering the compression of a description of random walks on a network. A multi-step greedy agglomerative strategy is employed to enable LPAf to escape the local optimum. Furthermore, an incomplete update condition is also adopted to speed up the convergence. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.

010       Monitorability Bounds via Expander, Sparsifier and Random Walks. The   Interplay Between On-Demand Monitoring and Anonymity
021       The network virtualization allows new on-demand management capabilities, in this work we demonstrate such a service, namely, on-demand efficient monitoring or anonymity. 
020       The proposed service is based on network virtualization of expanders or sparsifiers over the physical network. The defined virtual (or overlay) communication graphs coupled with a multi-hop extension of Valiant randomization based routing lets us monitor the entire traffic in the network, with a very few monitoring nodes. <br />In particular, we show that using overlay network with expansion properties and Valiant randomized load balancing it is enough to place $O(m)$ monitor nodes when the length of the overlay path (number of intermediate nodes chosen by Valiant's routing procedure) is $O(n/m)$. <br />We propose two randomized routing methods to implement policies for sending messages, and we show that they facilitate efficient monitoring of the entire traffic, such that the traffic is distributed uniformly in the network, and each monitor has equiprobable view of the network flow. In terms of complex networks, our result can be interpreted as a way to enforce the same betweenness centrality to all nodes in the network. <br />Additionally, we show that our results are useful in employing anonymity services. Thus, we propose monitoring or anonymity services, which can be deployed and shut down on-demand. Our work is the first, as far as we know, to bring such on-demand infrastructure structuring using the cloud network virtualization capability to existing monitoring or anonymity networks. We propose methods to theoretically improve services provided by existing anonymity networks, and optimize the degree of anonymity, in addition providing robustness and reliability to system usage and security. <br />We believe that, our constructions of overlay expanders and sparsifiers weighted network are of independent interest.

010       Minimum energy control for complex networks
021       The aim of this paper is to shed light on the problem of controlling a complex network with minimal control energy. 
020       We show first that the control energy depends on the time constant of the modes of the network, and that the closer the eigenvalues are to the imaginary axis of the complex plane, the less energy is required for complete controllability. In the limit case of networks having all purely imaginary eigenvalues (e.g. networks of coupled harmonic oscillators), several constructive algorithms for minimum control energy driver node selection are developed. A general heuristic principle valid for any directed network is also proposed: the overall cost of controlling a network is reduced when the controls are concentrated on the nodes with highest ratio of weighted outdegree vs indegree.

010       Uncovering hidden flows in physical networks
021       Understanding the interactions among nodes in a complex network is of great importance, since they disclose how these nodes are cooperatively supporting the functioning of the network. 
020       Scientists have developed numerous methods to uncover the underlying adjacent physical connectivity based on measurements of functional quantities of the nodes states. Often, the physical connectivity, the adjacency matrix, is available. Yet, little is known about how this adjacent connectivity impacts on the "hidden" flows being exchanged between any two arbitrary nodes, after travelling longer non-adjacent paths. In this Letter, we show that hidden physical flows in conservative flow networks, a quantity that is usually inaccessible to measurements, can be determined by the interchange of physical flows between any pair of adjacent nodes. Our approach applies to steady or dynamic state of either linear or non-linear complex networks that can be modelled by conservative flow networks, such as gas supply networks, water supply networks and power grids.

010       Deciphering the imprint of topology on nonlinear dynamical network   stability
021       Coupled oscillator networks show a complex interrelations between topological characteristics of the network and the nonlinear stability of single nodes with respect to large but realistic perturbations. 
020       We extend previous results on these relations by incorporating sampling-based measures of the transient behaviour of the system, its survivability, as well as its asymptotic behaviour, its basin stability. By combining basin stability and survivability we uncover novel, previously unknown asymptotic states with solitary, desynchronized oscillators which are rotating with a frequency different from their natural one. They occur almost exclusively after perturbations at nodes with specific topological properties. <br />More generally we confirm and significantly refine the results on the distinguished role tree-shaped appendices play for nonlinear stability. We find a topological classification scheme for nodes located in such appendices, that exactly separates them according to their stability properties, thus establishing a strong link between topology and dynamics. Hence, the results can be used for the identification of vulnerable nodes in power grids or other coupled oscillator networks. From this classification we can derive general design principles for resilient power grids. We find that striving for homogeneous network topologies facilitates a better performance in terms of nonlinear dynamical network stability. While the employed second-order Kuramoto-like model is parametrized to be representative for power grids, we expect these insights to transfer to other critical infrastructure systems or complex network dynamics appearing in various other fields.

010       Consensus clustering approach to group brain connectivity matrices
021       A novel approach rooted on the notion of consensus clustering, a strategy developed for community detection in complex networks, is proposed to cope with the heterogeneity that characterizes connectivity matrices in health and disease. 
020       The method can be summarized as follows: <br />(i) define, for each node, a distance matrix for the set of subjects by comparing the connectivity pattern of that node in all pairs of subjects; (ii) cluster the distance matrix for each node; (iii) build the consensus network from the corresponding partitions; (iv) extract groups of subjects by finding the communities of the consensus network thus obtained. <br />Differently from the previous implementations of consensus clustering, we thus propose to use the consensus strategy to combine the information arising from the connectivity patterns of each node. The proposed approach may be seen either as an exploratory technique or as an unsupervised pre-training step to help the subsequent construction of a supervised classifier. Applications on a toy model and two real data sets, show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, which represents heterogeneity of a set of subjects in terms of a weighted network, the consensus matrix.

010       Unification of theoretical approaches for epidemic spreading on complex   networks
021       Models of epidemic spreading on complex networks have attracted great attention among researchers in physics, mathematics, and epidemiology due to their success in predicting and controlling scenarios of epidemic spreading in real-world scenarios. 
020       To understand the interplay between epidemic spreading and the topology of a contact network, several outstanding theoretical approaches have been developed. An accurate theoretical approach describing the spreading dynamics must take both the network topology and dynamical correlations into consideration at the expense of increasing the complexity of the equations. In this short survey we unify the most widely used theoretical approaches for epidemic spreading on complex networks in terms of increasing complexity, including the mean-field, the heterogeneous mean-field, the quench mean-field, dynamical message-passing, link percolation, and pairwise approximation. We build connections among these approaches to provide new insights into developing an accurate theoretical approach to spreading dynamics on complex networks.

010       Multi-resolution community detection in massive networks
021       Aiming at improving the efficiency and accuracy of community detection in complex networks, we proposed a new algorithm, which is based on the idea that communities could be detected from subnetworks by comparing the internal and external cohesion of each subnetwork. 
020       In our method, similar nodes are firstly gathered into meta-communities, which are then decided to be retained or merged through a multilevel label propagation process, until all of them meet our community criterion. Our algorithm requires neither any priori information of communities nor optimization of any objective function. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks show that, our algorithm performs quite well and runs extremely fast, compared with several other popular algorithms. By tuning a resolution parameter, we can also observe communities at different scales, so this could reveal the hierarchical structure of the network. To further explore the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to the E-Coli transcriptional regulatory network, and found that all the identified modules have strong structural and functional coherence.

010       Prototyping RISC Based, Reconfigurable Networking Applications in Open   Source
021       In the last decade we have witnessed a rapid growth in data center systems, requiring new and highly complex networking devices. 
020       The need to refresh networking infrastructure whenever new protocols or functions are introduced, and the increasing costs that this entails, are of a concern to all data center providers. New generations of Systems on Chip (SoC), integrating microprocessors and higher bandwidth interfaces, are an emerging solution to this problem. These devices permit entirely new systems and architectures that can obviate the replacement of existing networking devices while enabling seamless functionality change. In this work, we explore open source, RISC based, SoC architectures with high performance networking capabilities. The prototype architectures are implemented on the NetFPGA-SUME platform. Beyond details of the architecture, we also describe the hardware implementation and the porting of operating systems to the platform. The platform can be exploited for the development of practical networking appliances, and we provide use case examples.

010       Multi-node basin stability in complex dynamical networks
021       Dynamical entities interacting with each other on complex networks often exhibit multistability. 
020       The stability of a desired steady regime (e.g., a synchronized state) to large perturbations is critical in the operation of many real-world networked dynamical systems such as ecosystems, power grids, the human brain, etc. This necessitates the development of appropriate quantifiers of stability of multiple stable states of such systems. Motivated by the concept of basin stability (BS) (Menck et al., Nature Physics 9, 89 (2013)), we propose here the general framework of \emph{multi-node basin stability} for gauging global stability and robustness of networked dynamical systems in response to non-local perturbations simultaneously affecting multiple nodes of a system. The framework of multi-node BS provides an estimate of the critical number of nodes which when simultaneously perturbed, significantly reduces the capacity of the system to return to the desired stable state. Further, this methodology can be applied to estimate the minimum number of nodes of the network to be controlled or safeguarded from external perturbations to ensure proper operation of the system. Multi-node BS can also be utilized for probing the influence of spatially localised perturbations or targeted attacks to specific parts of a network. We demonstrate the potential of multi-node BS in assessing the stability of the synchronized state in a deterministic scale-free network of R\"{o}ssler oscillators and a conceptual model of the power grid of the United Kingdom with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics.

010       Complex Network Tools to Understand the Behavior of Criminality in Urban   Areas
021       Complex networks are nowadays employed in several applications. 
020       Modeling urban street networks is one of them, and in particular to analyze criminal aspects of a city. Several research groups have focused on such application, but until now, there is a lack of a well-defined methodology for employing complex networks in a whole crime analysis process, i.e. from data preparation to a deep analysis of criminal communities. Furthermore, the "toolset" available for those works is not complete enough, also lacking techniques to maintain up-to-date, complete crime datasets and proper assessment measures. In this sense, we propose a threefold methodology for employing complex networks in the detection of highly criminal areas within a city. Our methodology comprises three tasks: (i) Mapping of Urban Crimes; (ii) Criminal Community Identification; and (iii) Crime Analysis. Moreover, it provides a proper set of assessment measures for analyzing intrinsic criminality of communities, especially when considering different crime types. We show our methodology by applying it to a real crime dataset from the city of San Francisco - CA, USA. The results confirm its effectiveness to identify and analyze high criminality areas within a city. Hence, our contributions provide a basis for further developments on complex networks applied to crime analysis.

010       Finding network communities using modularity density
021       Many real-world complex networks exhibit a community structure, in which the modules correspond to actual functional units. 
020       Identifying these communities is a key challenge for scientists. A common approach is to search for the network partition that maximizes a quality function. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a recently proposed function, namely modularity density. We show that it does not incur in the drawbacks suffered by traditional modularity, and that it can identify networks without ground-truth community structure, deriving its analytical dependence on link density in generic random graphs. In addition, we show that modularity density allows an easy comparison between networks of different sizes, and we also present some limitations that methods based on modularity density may suffer from. Finally, we introduce an efficient, quadratic community detection algorithm based on modularity density maximization, validating its accuracy against theoretical predictions and on a set of benchmark networks.

010       Parallel numerical modeling of hybrid-dimensional compositional   non-isothermal Darcy flows in fractured porous media
021       This paper introduces a new discrete fracture model accounting for non-isothermal compositional multiphase Darcy flows and complex networks of fractures with intersecting, immersed and non immersed fractures. 
020       The so called hybrid-dimensional model using a 2D model in the fractures coupled with a 3D model in the matrix is first derived rigorously starting from the equi-dimensional matrix fracture model. Then, it is dis-cretized using a fully implicit time integration combined with the Vertex Approximate Gradient (VAG) finite volume scheme which is adapted to polyhedral meshes and anisotropic heterogeneous media. The fully coupled systems are assembled and solved in parallel using the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm with one layer of ghost cells. This strategy allows for a local assembly of the discrete systems. An efficient preconditioner is implemented to solve the linear systems at each time step and each Newton type iteration of the simulation. The numerical efficiency of our approach is assessed on different meshes, fracture networks, and physical settings in terms of parallel scalability, nonlinear convergence and linear convergence.

010       Higher-order organization of complex networks

020       Many networks are known to exhibit rich, lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges. However, higher-order organization of complex networks---at the level of small network subgraphs---remains largely unknown. Here we develop a generalized framework for clustering networks based on higher-order connectivity patterns. This framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges. The framework reveals higher-order organization in a number of networks including information propagation units in neuronal networks and hub structure in transportation networks. Results show that networks exhibit rich higher-order organizational structures that are exposed by clustering based on higher-order connectivity patterns.

010       Complex Network Theoretical Analysis on Information Dissemination over   Vehicular Networks
021       How to enhance the communication efficiency and quality on vehicular networks is one critical important issue. 
020       While with the larger and larger scale of vehicular networks in dense cities, the real-world datasets show that the vehicular networks essentially belong to the complex network model. Meanwhile, the extensive research on complex networks has shown that the complex network theory can both provide an accurate network illustration model and further make great contributions to the network design, optimization and management. In this paper, we start with analyzing characteristics of a taxi GPS dataset and then establishing the vehicular-to-infrastructure, vehicle-to-vehicle and the hybrid communication model, respectively. Moreover, we propose a clustering algorithm for station selection, a traffic allocation optimization model and an information source selection model based on the communication performances and complex network theory.

Our results are tested against numerical calculations using complex networks of resonators and chaotic graphs as CPA cavities.

010       Complex Networks Unveiling Spatial Patterns in Turbulence

Although interest on complex networks has been increasing in the last years, few recent studies have been applied to turbulence. We propose an investigation starting from a two-point correlation for the kinetic energy of a forced isotropic field numerically solved. Among all the metrics analyzed, the degree centrality is the most significant, suggesting the formation of spatial patterns which coherently move with similar vorticity over the large eddy turnover time scale. Pattern size can be quantified through a newly-introduced parameter (i.e., average physical distance) and varies from small to intermediate scales. The network analysis allows a systematic identification of different spatial regions, providing new insights into the spatial characterization of turbulent flows. Based on present findings, the application to highly inhomogeneous flows seems promising and deserves additional future investigation.

010       The Diverse Club: The Integrative Core of Complex Networks
021       A complex system can be represented and analyzed as a network, where nodes represent the units of the network and edges represent connections between those units. 
020       For example, a brain network represents neurons as nodes and axons between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse club--a set of nodes that have edges diversely distributed across the network. The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures. Given the variety of different networks that we analyzed--the c. elegans, the macaque brain, the human brain, the United States power grid, and global air traffic--the diverse club appears to be ubiquitous in complex networks. These results warrant the distinction and analysis of two critical clubs of nodes in all complex systems.

010       Around Average Behavior: 3-lambda Network Model
021       The analysis of networks affects the research of many real phenomena. 
020       The complex network structure can be viewed as a network's state at the time of the analysis or as a result of the process through which the network arises. Research activities focus on both and, thanks to them, we know not only many measurable properties of networks but also the essence of some phenomena that occur during the evolution of networks. One typical research area is the analysis of co-authorship networks and their evolution. In our paper, the analysis of one real-world co-authorship network and inspiration from existing models form the basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda network model. This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior of nodes revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The 3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated with the average behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based on this model assumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in which both new and existing nodes are participating. In the paper we present the results of the analysis of a co-authorship network and formulate a hypothesis and a model based on this hypothesis. Later in the paper, we examine the outputs from the network generator based on the 3-lambda model and show that generated networks have characteristics known from the environment of real-world networks.

010       Estimation of Graphlet Statistics
021       Graphlets are induced subgraphs of a large network and are important for understanding and modeling complex networks. 
020       Despite their practical importance, graphlets have been severely limited to applications and domains with relatively small graphs. Most previous work has focused on exact algorithms, however, it is often too expensive to compute graphlets exactly in massive networks with billions of edges, and finding an approximate count is usually sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose an unbiased graphlet estimation framework that is (a) fast with significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art, (b) parallel with nearly linear-speedups, (c) accurate with &lt;1% relative error, (d) scalable and space-efficient for massive networks with billions of edges, and (e) flexible for a variety of real-world settings, as well as estimating macro and micro-level graphlet statistics (e.g., counts) of both connected and disconnected graphlets. In addition, an adaptive approach is introduced that finds the smallest sample size required to obtain estimates within a given user-defined error bound. On 300 networks from 20 domains, we obtain &lt;1% relative error for all graphlets. This is significantly more accurate than existing methods while using less data. Moreover, it takes a few seconds on billion edge graphs (as opposed to days/weeks). These are by far the largest graphlet computations to date.

010       Distribution of zeros of the S-matrix of chaotic cavities with localized   losses and Coherent Perfect Absorption: non-perturbative results
021       We employ the Random Matrix Theory framework to calculate the density of zeroes of an $M$-channel scattering matrix describing a chaotic cavity with a single localized absorber embedded in it. 
020       Our approach extends beyond the weak-coupling limit of the cavity with the channels and applies for any absorption strength. Importantly it provides an insight for the optimal amount of loss needed to realize a chaotic coherent perfect absorbing (CPA) trap. Our predictions are tested against simulations for two types of traps: a complex network of resonators and quantum graphs.

010       Modularity of complex networks models
021       Modularity is designed to measure the strength of division of a network into clusters (known also as communities). 
020       Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the vertices within clusters but sparse connections between vertices of different clusters. As a result, modularity is often used in optimization methods for detecting community structure in networks, and so it is an important graph parameter from a practical point of view. Unfortunately, many existing non-spatial models of complex networks do not generate graphs with high modularity; on the other hand, spatial models naturally create clusters. We investigate this phenomenon by considering a few examples from both sub-classes. We prove precise theoretical results for the classical model of random d-regular graphs as well as the preferential attachment model, and contrast these results with the ones for the spatial preferential attachment (SPA) model that is a model for complex networks in which vertices are embedded in a metric space, and each vertex has a sphere of influence whose size increases if the vertex gains an in-link, and otherwise decreases with time. The results obtained in this paper can be used for developing statistical tests for models selection and to measure statistical significance of clusters observed in complex networks.

010       Multitarget search on complex networks: A logarithmic growth of global   mean random cover time
021       We investigate multitarget search on complex networks and derive an exact expression for the mean random cover time that quantifies the expected time a walker needs to visit multiple targets. 
020       Based on this, we recover and extend some interesting results of multitarget search on networks. Specifically, we observe the logarithmic increase of the global mean random cover time with the target number for a broad range of random search processes, including generic random walks, biased random walks, and maximal entropy random walks. We show that the logarithmic growth pattern is a universal feature of multi-target search on networks by using the annealed network approach and the Sherman-Morrison formula. Moreover, we find that for biased random walks, the global mean random cover time can be minimized, and that the corresponding optimal parameter also minimizes the global mean first passage time, pointing towards its robustness. Our findings further confirm that the logarithmic growth pattern is a universal law governing multitarget search in confined media.

010       Dimerized Decomposition of Quantum Evolution on an Arbitrary Graph
021       The study of quantum evolution on graphs for diversified topologies is beneficial to modeling various realistic systems. 
020       A systematic method, the dimerized decomposition, is proposed to analyze the dynamics on an arbitrary network. By introducing global "flows" among interlinked dimerized subsystems, each of which locally consists of an input and a output port, the method provides an intuitive picture that the local properties of the subsystem are separated from the global structure of the network. The pictorial interpretation of quantum evolution as multiple flows through the graph allows for the analysis of the complex network dynamics supplementary to the conventional spectral method.

010       Fractality and degree correlations in scale-free networks
021       Fractal scale-free networks are empirically known to exhibit disassortative degree mixing. 
020       It is, however, not obvious whether a negative degree correlation between nearest neighbor nodes makes a scale-free network fractal. Here we examine the possibility that disassortativity in complex networks is the origin of fractality. To this end, maximally disassortative (MD) networks are prepared by rewiring edges while keeping the degree sequence of an initial uncorrelated scale-free network that is guaranteed to become fractal by rewiring edges. Our results show that most of MD networks with different topologies are not fractal, which demonstrates that disassortativity does not cause the fractal property of networks. In addition, we suggest that fractality of scale-free networks requires a long-range repulsive correlation in similar degrees.

010       Hierarchical invasion of cooperation in complex networks
021       The emergence and survival of cooperation is one of the hardest problems still open in science. 
020       Several factors such as the existence of punishment, fluctuations in finite systems, repeated interactions and the formation of prestige may all contribute to explain the counter-intuitive prevalence of cooperation in natural and social systems. The characteristics of the interaction networks have been also signaled as an element favoring the persistence of cooperators. Here we consider the invasion dynamics of cooperative behaviors in complex topologies. The invasion of a heterogeneous network fully occupied by defectors is performed starting from nodes with a given number of connections (degree) $k_0$. The system is then evolved within a Prisoner's Dilemma game and the outcome is analyzed as a function of $k_0$ and the degree $k$ of the nodes adopting cooperation. Carried out using both numerical and analytical approaches, our results show that the invasion proceeds following preferentially a hierarchical order in the nodes from those with higher degree to those with lower degree. However, the invasion of cooperation will succeed only when the initial cooperators are numerous enough to form a cluster from which cooperation can spread. This implies that the initial condition must be a suitable equilibrium between high degree and high numerosity, which usually takes place, when possible, at intermediate values of $k_0$. These findings have potential applications, as they suggest that, in order to promote cooperative behavior on complex networks, one should infect with cooperators \emph{high but not too high} degree nodes.

010       Reactive immunization on complex networks
021       Epidemic spreading on complex networks depends on the topological structure as well as on the dynamical properties of the infection itself. 
020       Generally speaking, highly connected individuals play the role of hubs and are crucial to channel information across the network. On the other hand, static topological quantities measuring the connectivity structure are independent on the dynamical mechanisms of the infection. A natural question is therefore how to improve the topological analysis by some kind of dynamical information that may be extracted from the ongoing infection itself. In this spirit, we propose a novel vaccination scheme that exploits information from the details of the infection pattern at the moment when the vaccination strategy is applied. Numerical simulations of the infection process show that the proposed immunization strategy is effective and robust on a wide class of complex networks.

010       Modeling and Performance Studies of Data Communication Networks using   Dynamic Complex Networks
021       All the existing real world networks are evolving, hence, study of traffic dynamics in these enlarged networks is a challenging task. 
020       The critical issue is to optimize the network structure to improve network capacity and avoid traffic congestion. We are interested in taking user's routes such that it is least congested with optimal network capacity. Network capacity may be improved either by optimizing network topology or enhancing in routing approach. In this context, we propose and design a model of the time varying data communication networks (TVCN) based on the dynamics of in-flowing links. Newly appeared node prefers to attach with most influential node present in the network. In this paper, influence is termed as \textit{reputation} and is applied for computing overall congestion at any node. User path with least betweenness centrality and most reputation is preferred for routing. Kelly's optimization formulation for a rate allocation problem is used for obtaining optimal rates of distinct users at different time instants and it is found that the user's path with lowest betweenness centrality and highest reputation will always give maximum rate at stable point.

010       Stellar Dynamics and Stellar Phenomena Near A Massive Black Hole
021       Most galactic nuclei harbor a massive black hole (MBH), whose birth and evolution are closely linked to those of its host galaxy. 
020       The unique conditions near the MBH: high velocity and density in the steep potential of a massive singular relativistic object, lead to unusual modes of stellar birth, evolution, dynamics and death. A complex network of dynamical mechanisms, operating on multiple timescales, deflect stars to orbits that intercept the MBH. Such close encounters lead to energetic interactions with observable signatures and consequences for the evolution of the MBH and its stellar environment. Galactic nuclei are astrophysical laboratories that test and challenge our understanding of MBH formation, strong gravity, stellar dynamics, and stellar physics. I review from a theoretical perspective the wide range of stellar phenomena that occur near MBHs, focusing on the role of stellar dynamics near an isolated MBH in a relaxed stellar cusp.

010       Organization and hierarchy of the human functional brain network lead to   a chain-like core
021       The brain is a paradigmatic example of a complex system as its functionality emerges as a global property of local mesoscopic and microscopic interactions. 
020       Complex network theory allows to elicit the functional architecture of the brain in terms of links (correlations) between nodes (grey matter regions) and to extract information out of the noise. Here we present the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data from forty healthy humans during the resting condition for the investigation of the basal scaffold of the functional brain network organization. We show how brain regions tend to coordinate by forming a highly hierarchical chain-like structure of homogeneously clustered anatomical areas. A maximum spanning tree approach revealed the centrality of the occipital cortex and the peculiar aggregation of cerebellar regions to form a closed core. We also report the hierarchy of network segregation and the level of clusters integration as a function of the connectivity strength between brain regions.

Different from former strategies, our method only requires local and observable information of network, and is low-cost and widely applicable in practice. In the simulation of the phase transition for various network models, our method performs well in mitigating congestion both locally and globally. By comparison, we also uncover the deficiency of former degree-biased approaches. Owing to the rapid development of transportation networks, our method may be helpful for modern society.

010       Controllability of temporal networks: An analysis using higher-order   networks
021       The control of complex networks is a significant challenge, especially when the network topology of the system to be controlled is dynamic. 
020       Addressing this challenge, here we introduce a novel approach which allows exploring the controllability of temporal networks. Studying six empirical data sets, we particularly show that order correlations in the sequence of interactions can both increase or decrease the time needed to achieve full controllability. Counter-intuitively, we find that this effect can be opposite than the effect of order correlations on other dynamical processes. Specifically, we show that order correlations that speed up a diffusion process in a given system can slow down the control of the same system, and vice-versa. Building on the higher-order graphical modeling framework introduced in recent works, we further demonstrate that spectral properties of higher-order network topologies can be used to analytically explain this phenomenon.

010       Community detection based on significance optimization in complex   networks
021       Community structure is an important structural property that extensively exists in various complex networks. 
020       In the past decade, much attention has been paid to the design of community-detection methods, but analyzing the behaviors of the methods is also of interest in the theoretical research and real applications. Here, we focus on an important measure for community structure, significance [Sci. Rep. 3 (2013) 2930]. Specifically, we study the effect of various network parameters on this measure in detail, analyze the critical behaviors of it in partition transition, and analytically give the formula of the critical points and the phase diagrams. The results shows that the critical number of communities in partition transition increases dramatically with the difference between inter- and intra-community link densities, and thus significance optimization displays higher resolution in community detection than many other methods, but it is also easily to lead to the excessive splitting of communities. By Louvain algorithm for significance optimization, we confirmed the theoretical results on artificial and real-world networks, and give a series of comparisons with some classical methods.

010       The relation between migration and FDI in the OECD from a complex   network perspective
021       We explore the relationship between human migration and OECD's foreign direct investment (FDI) using a gravity equation enriched with variables that account for complex-network effects. 
020       Based on a panel data analysis, we find a strong positive correlation between the migration network and the FDI network, which can be mostly explained by countries' economic/demographic sizes and geographical distance. We highlight the existence of a stronger positive FDI relationship in pairs of countries that are more central in the migration network. Both intensive and extensive forms of centrality are FDI enhancing. Illuminating this result, we show that bilateral FDI between any two countries is further affected positively by the complex web of "third party" corridors/migration stocks of the international migration network (IMN). Our findings are consistent whether we consider bilateral FDI and bilateral migration figures, or we focus on the outward FDI and the respective inward migration of the OECD countries.

010       Security Game with Non-additive Utilities and Multiple Attacker   Resources
021       There has been significant interest in studying security games for modeling the interplay of attacks and defenses on various systems involving critical infrastructure, financial system security, political campaigns, and civil safeguarding. 
020       However, existing security game models typically either assume additive utility functions, or that the attacker can attack only one target. Such assumptions lead to tractable analysis, but miss key inherent dependencies that exist among different targets in current complex networks. In this paper, we generalize the classical security game models to allow for non-additive utility functions. We also allow attackers to be able to attack multiple targets. We examine such a general security game from a theoretical perspective and provide a unified view. In particular, we show that each security game is equivalent to a combinatorial optimization problem over a set system $\varepsilon$, which consists of defender's pure strategy space. The key technique we use is based on the transformation, projection of a polytope, and the elipsoid method. This work settles several open questions in security game domain and significantly extends the state of-the-art of both the polynomial solvable and NP-hard class of the security game.

010       Vulnerability of Clustering under Node Failure in Complex Networks
021       Robustness in response to unexpected events is always desirable for real-world networks. 
020       To improve the robustness of any networked system, it is important to analyze vulnerability to external perturbation such as random failures or adversarial attacks occurring to elements of the network. In this paper, we study an emerging problem in assessing the robustness of complex networks: the vulnerability of the clustering of the network to the failure of network elements. Specifically, we identify vertices whose failures will critically damage the network by degrading its clustering, evaluated through the average clustering coefficient. This problem is important because any significant change made to the clustering, resulting from element-wise failures, could degrade network performance such as the ability for information to propagate in a social network. We formulate this vulnerability analysis as an optimization problem, prove its NP-completeness and non-monotonicity, and we offer two algorithms to identify the vertices most important to clustering. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments in synthesized social networks generated by various well-known models as well as traces of real social networks. The empirical results over other competitive strategies show the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.

010       Vulnerability and co-susceptibility determine the size of network   cascades
021       In a network, a local disturbance can propagate and eventually cause a substantial part of the system to fail, in cascade events that are easy to conceptualize but extraordinarily difficult to predict. 
020       Here, we develop a statistical framework that can predict cascade size distributions by incorporating two ingredients only: the vulnerability of individual components and the co-susceptibility of groups of components (i.e., their tendency to fail together). Using cascades in power grids as a representative example, we show that correlations between component failures define structured and often surprisingly large groups of co-susceptible components. Aside from their implications for blackout studies, these results provide insights and a new modeling framework for understanding cascades in financial systems, food webs, and complex networks in general.

010       Transitivity Demolition and the Falls of Social Networks
021       In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its nodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network's structure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and edges removal. 
020       Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose failure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected triples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important because connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many real-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable data transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in mobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can greatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which can further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such crucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and robustness of many complex systems in practice. <br />We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their intractability. We next propose efficient approximation algorithms, namely DAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an $(1-1/e)$-approximate ratio (compared to the overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the best triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-law networks. This advantage makes our algorithms scale extremely well even for very large networks. In an application perspective, we perform comprehensive experiments on real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges. These empirical experiments indicate that our approaches achieve comparably better results while are up to 100x faster than current state-of-the-art methods.

010       Multiplex Network Regression: How do relations drive interactions?
021       We introduce a statistical method to investigate the impact of dyadic relations on complex networks generated from repeated interactions. 
020       It is based on generalised hypergeometric ensembles, a class of statistical network ensembles developed recently. We represent different types of known relations between system elements by weighted graphs, separated in the different layers of a multiplex network. With our method we can regress the influence of each relational layer, the independent variables, on the interaction counts, the dependent variables. Moreover, we can test the statistical significance of the relations as explanatory variables for the observed interactions. To demonstrate the power of our approach and its broad applicability, we will present examples based on synthetic and empirical data.

010       A bibliometric approach to Systematic Mapping Studies: The case of the   evolution and perspectives of community detection in complex networks
021       Critical analysis of the state of the art is a necessary task when identifying new research lines worthwhile to pursue. 
020       To such an end, all the available work related to the field of interest must be taken into account. The key point is how to organize, analyze, and make sense of the huge amount of scientific literature available today on any topic. To tackle this problem, we present here a bibliometric approach to Systematic Mapping Studies (SMS). Thus, a modify SMS protocol is used relying on the scientific references metadata to extract, process and interpret the wealth of information contained in nowadays research literature. As a test case, the procedure is applied to determine the current state and perspectives of community detection in complex networks. Our results show that community detection is a still active, far from exhausted, in development, field. In addition, we find that, by far, the most exploited methods are those related to determining hierarchical community structures. On the other hand, the results show that fuzzy clustering techniques, despite their interest, are underdeveloped as well as the adaptation of existing algorithms to parallel or, more specifically, distributed, computational systems.

010       Geometric explanation of the rich-club phenomenon in complex networks
021       The rich club organization (the presence of highly connected hub core in a network) influences many structural and functional characteristics of networks including topology, the efficiency of paths and distribution of load. 
020       Despite its major role, the literature contains only a very limited set of models capable of generating networks with realistic rich club structure. One possible reason is that the rich club organization is a divisive property among complex networks which exhibit great diversity, in contrast to other metrics (e.g. diameter, clustering or degree distribution) which seem to behave very similarly across many networks. Here we propose a simple yet powerful geometry-based growing model which can generate realistic complex networks with high rich club diversity by controlling a single geometric parameter. The growing model is validated against the Internet, protein-protein interaction, airport and power grid networks.

010       Control of multidimensional systems on complex network
021       Multidimensional systems coupled via complex networks are widespread in nature and thus frequently invoked for a large plethora of interesting applications. 
020       From ecology to physics, individual entities in mutual interactions are grouped in families, homogeneous in kind. These latter interact selectively, through a sequence of self-consistently regulated steps, whose deeply rooted architecture is stored in the assigned matrix of connections. The asymptotic equilibrium eventually attained by the system, and its associated stability, can be assessed by employing standard nonlinear dynamics tools. For many practical applications, it is however important to externally drive the system towards a desired equilibrium, which is resilient, hence stable, to external perturbations. To this end we here consider a system made up of $N$ interacting populations which evolve according to general rate equations, bearing attributes of universality. One species is added to the pool of interacting families and used as a dynamical controller to induce novel stable equilibria. Use can be made of the root locus method to shape the needed control, in terms of intrinsic reactivity and adopted protocol of injection. The proposed method is tested on both synthetic and real data, thus enabling to demonstrate its robustness and versatility.

010       Flow Characteristics and Cores of Complex Network and Multiplex Type   Systems
021       Subject of research is complex networks and network systems. 
020       The network system is defined as a complex network in which flows are moved. Classification of flows in the network is carried out on the basis of ordering and continuity. It is shown that complex networks with different types of flows generate various network systems. Flow analogues of the basic concepts of the theory of complex networks are introduced and the main problems of this theory in terms of flow characteristics are formulated. Local and global flow characteristics of networks bring closer the theory of complex networks to the systems theory and systems analysis. Concept of flow core of network system is introduced and defined how it simplifies the process of its investigation. Concepts of kernel and flow core of multiplex are determined. Features of operation of multiplex type systems are analyzed.

010       Network growth models: A behavioural basis for attachment proportional   to fitness
021       Several growth models have been proposed in the literature for scale-free complex networks, with a range of fitness-based attachment models gaining prominence recently. 
020       However, the processes by which such fitness-based attachment behaviour can arise are less well understood, making it difficult to compare the relative merits of such models. This paper analyses an evolutionary mechanism that would give rise to a fitness-based attachment process. In particular, it is proven by analytical and numerical methods that in homogeneous networks, the minimisation of maximum exposure to node unfitness leads to attachment probabilities that are proportional to node fitness. This result is then extended to heterogeneous networks, with supply chain networks being used as an example.

010       The Small World of Osteocytes: Connectomics of the Lacuno-Canalicular   Network in Bone
021       Osteocytes and their cell processes reside in a large, interconnected network of voids pervading the mineralized bone matrix of most vertebrates. 
020       This osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (OLCN) is believed to play important roles in mechanosensing, mineral homeostasis, and for the mechanical properties of bone. While the extracellular matrix structure of bone is extensively studied on ultrastructural and macroscopic scales, there is a lack of quantitative knowledge on how the cellular network is organized. Using a recently introduced imaging and quantification approach, we analyze the OLCN in different bone types from mouse and sheep that exhibit different degrees of structural organization not only of the cell network but also of the fibrous matrix deposited by the cells. We define a number of robust, quantitative measures that are derived from the theory of complex networks. These measures enable us to gain insights into how efficient the network is organized with regard to intercellular transport and communication. Our analysis shows that the cell network in regularly organized, slow-growing bone tissue from sheep is less connected, but more efficiently organized compared to irregular and fast-growing bone tissue from mice. On the level of statistical topological properties (edges per node, edge length and degree distribution), both network types are indistinguishable, highlighting that despite pronounced differences at the tissue level, the topological architecture of the osteocyte canalicular network at the subcellular level may be independent of species and bone type. Our results suggest a universal mechanism underlying the self-organization of individual cells into a large, interconnected network during bone formation and mineralization.

010       Dilution of Ferromagnets via a Random Graph-based Strategy
021       The dynamics and behavior of ferromagnets have a great relevance even beyond the domain of statistical physics. 
020       In this work, we propose a Monte Carlo method, based on random graphs, for modeling their dilution. In particular, we focus on ferromagnets with dimension $D \ge 4$, which can be approximated by the Curie-Weiss model. Since the latter has as graphic counterpart a complete graph, a dilution can be in this case viewed as a pruning process. Hence, in order to exploit this mapping, the proposed strategy uses a modified version of the Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graph model. In doing so, we are able both to simulate a continuous dilution, and to realize diluted ferromagnets in one step. The proposed strategy is studied by means of numerical simulations, aimed to analyze main properties and equilibria of the resulting diluted ferromagnets. To conclude, we also provide a brief description of further applications of our strategy in the field of complex networks.

010       A hybrid approach for risk assessment of loan guarantee network
021       Groups of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) back each other and form guarantee network to obtain loan from banks. 
020       The risk over the networked enterprises may cause significant contagious damage. To dissolve such risks, we propose a hybrid feature representation, which is feeded into a gradient boosting model for credit risk assessment of guarantee network. Empirical study is performed on a ten-year guarantee loan record from commercial banks. We find that often hundreds or thousands of enterprises back each other and constitute a sparse complex network. We study the risk of various structures of loan guarantee network, and observe the high correlation between defaults with centrality, and with the communities of the network. In particular, our quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction performance on real-world data, which can be useful to both regulators and stakeholders.

010       Routes Obey Hierarchy in Complex Networks
021       Various hypotheses exist about the paths used for communication between the nodes of complex networks. 
020       Most studies simply suppose that communication goes via shortest paths, while others have more explicit assumptions about how routing (alternatively navigation or search) works or should work in real networks. However, these assumptions are rarely checked against real data. Here we directly analyze the structure of operational paths using real measurements. For this purpose we use existing and newly created datasets having both the topology of the network and a sufficient number of empirically-determined paths over it. Such datasets are processed for air transportation networks, the human brain, the Internet and the fit-fat-cat word ladder game. Our results suggest that from the great number of possible paths, nature seems to pick according to some simple rules, which we will refer to as routing policies. First we confirm, that the preference of short paths is an inevitable policy element, however the observed stretch of the paths suggests that there are other policies at work simultaneously. We identify two additional policies common in our networks: the "conform hierarchy", meaning that the paths should obey the structural hierarchy of the network, and the "prefer downstream" policy which promotes avoiding the network core if possible. Building upon these simple policies, we propose a synthetic routing policy which can recover the basic statistical properties of the operational paths in networks. Our results can be helpful in estimating the reaction of complex systems for stress coming from the outside more accurately than the shortest path assumption permits.

010       Optimal Resource Allocation with Node and Link Capacity Constraints in   Complex Networks
021       With the tremendous increase of the Internet traffic, achieving the best performance with limited resources is becoming an extremely urgent problem. 
020       In order to address this concern, in this paper, we build an optimization problem which aims to maximize the total utility of traffic flows with the capacity constraint of nodes and links in the network. Based on Duality Theory, we propose an iterative algorithm which adjusts the rates of traffic flows and capacity of nodes and links simultaneously to maximize the total utility. Simulation results show that our algorithm performs better than the NUP algorithm on BA and ER network models, which has shown to get the best performance so far. Since our research combines the topology information with capacity constraint, it may give some insights for resource allocation in real communication networks.

010       CRSTIP - An Assessment Scheme for Security Assessment Processes
021       Complex networked systems are an integral part of today's support infrastructures. 
020       Due to their importance, these systems become more and more the target for cyber-attacks, suffering a notable number of security incidents. Also, they are subject to regulation by national and international legislation. An operator of such an infrastructure or system is responsible for ensuring its security and correct functioning in order to satisfy customers. In addition, the entire process of risk and quality control needs to be efficient and manageable. This short paper introduces the Compliance, Risk Assessment and Security Testing Improvement Profiling (CRSTIP) scheme. CRSTIP is an evaluation scheme that enables assessing the maturity of security assessment processes, taking into consideration systematic use of formalisms, integration and tool-support in the areas of compliance assessment, security risk assessment and security testing. The paper describes the elements of the scheme and their application to one of the case studies of the RASEN research project.

021       Bell's theorem was a cornerstone for our understanding of quantum theory, and the establishment of Bell non-locality played a crucial role in the development of quantum information. 
020       Recently, its extension to complex networks has been attracting a growing attention, but a deep characterization of quantum behaviour is still missing for this novel context. In this work we analyze quantum correlations arising in the bilocality scenario, that is a tripartite quantum network where the correlations between the parties are mediated by two independent sources of states. First, we prove that non-bilocal correlations witnessed through a Bell-state measurement in the central node of the network form a subset of those obtainable by means of a separable measurement. This leads us to derive the maximal violation of the bilocality inequality that can be achieved by arbitrary two-qubit quantum states and arbitrary projective separable measurements. We then analyze in details the relation between the violation of the bilocality inequality and the CHSH inequality. Finally, we show how our method can be extended to n-locality scenario consisting of n two-qubit quantum states distributed among n+1 nodes of a star-shaped network.

010       Complex Networks: from Classical to Quantum
021       Recent progress in applying complex network theory to problems faced in quantum information and computation has resulted in a beneficial crossover between two fields. 
020       Complex network methods have successfully been used to characterize quantum walk and transport models, entangled communication networks, graph theoretic models of emergent space-time and in detecting community structure in quantum systems. Information physics is setting the stage for a theory of complex and networked systems with quantum information-inspired methods appearing in complex network science, including information-theoretic distance and correlation measures for network characterization. Novel quantum induced effects have been predicted in random graphs---where edges represent entangled links---and quantum computer algorithms have recently been proposed to offer super-polynomial enhancement for several network and graph theoretic problems. Here we review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing the similarities and reconciling the differences found in the series of results at the intersection of these two fields.

010       An efficient approach to suppress the negative role of contrarian   oscillators in synchronization
021       It has been found that contrarian oscillators usually take a negative role in the collective behaviors formed by conformist oscillators. 
020       However, experiments revealed that it is also possible to achieve a strong coherence even when there are contrarians in the system such as neuron networks with both excitable and inhibitory neurons. To understand the underlying mechanism of this abnormal phenomenon, we here consider a complex network of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with mixed positive and negative couplings and present an efficient approach, i.e. tit-for-tat strategy, to suppress the negative role of contrarian oscillators in synchronization and thus increase the order parameter of synchronization. Two classes of contrarian oscillators are numerically studied and a brief theoretical analysis is provided to explain the numerical results.

010       Analysing Congestion Problems in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
021       Congestion problems are omnipresent in today's complex networks and represent a challenge in many research domains. 
020       In the context of Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), approaches like difference rewards and resource abstraction have shown promising results in tackling such problems. Resource abstraction was shown to be an ideal candidate for solving large-scale resource allocation problems in a fully decentralized manner. However, its performance and applicability strongly depends on some, until now, undocumented assumptions. Two of the main congestion benchmark problems considered in the literature are: the Beach Problem Domain and the Traffic Lane Domain. In both settings the highest system utility is achieved when overcrowding one resource and keeping the rest at optimum capacity. We analyse how abstract grouping can promote this behaviour and how feasible it is to apply this approach in a real-world domain (i.e., what assumptions need to be satisfied and what knowledge is necessary). We introduce a new test problem, the Road Network Domain (RND), where the resources are no longer independent, but rather part of a network (e.g., road network), thus choosing one path will also impact the load on other paths having common road segments. We demonstrate the application of state-of-the-art MARL methods for this new congestion model and analyse their performance. RND allows us to highlight an important limitation of resource abstraction and show that the difference rewards approach manages to better capture and inform the agents about the dynamics of the environment.

010       A Little Less Interaction, A Little More Action: A Modular Framework for   Network Troubleshooting
021       An ideal network troubleshooting system would be an almost fully automated system, monitoring the whole network at once, feeding the results to a knowledge-based decision making system that suggests actions to the operator or corrects the failure automatically. 
020       Reality is quite the contrary: operators separated in their offices try to track down complex networking failures in their own way, which is generally a long sequence of manually edited parallel shell commands (mostly ping, traceroute, route, iperf, ofctl etc.). This process requires operators to be "masters of complexity" (which they often are) and continuous interaction. In this paper we aim at narrowing this huge gap between vision and reality by introducing a modular framework capable of (i) formalizing troubleshooting processes as the concatenation of executable functions [called Troubleshooting Graphs (TSGs)], (ii) executing these graphs via an interpreter, (iii) evaluating and navigating between the outputs of the functions and (iv) sharing troubleshooting know-hows in a formalized manner.

010       Weighted Random Walk Sampling for Multi-Relational Recommendation
021       In the information overloaded web, personalized recommender systems are essential tools to help users find most relevant information. 
020       The most heavily-used recommendation frameworks assume user interactions that are characterized by a single relation. However, for many tasks, such as recommendation in social networks, user-item interactions must be modeled as a complex network of multiple relations, not only a single relation. Recently research on multi-relational factorization and hybrid recommender models has shown that using extended meta-paths to capture additional information about both users and items in the network can enhance the accuracy of recommendations in such networks. Most of this work is focused on unweighted heterogeneous networks, and to apply these techniques, weighted relations must be simplified into binary ones. However, information associated with weighted edges, such as user ratings, which may be crucial for recommendation, are lost in such binarization. In this paper, we explore a random walk sampling method in which the frequency of edge sampling is a function of edge weight, and apply this generate extended meta-paths in weighted heterogeneous networks. With this sampling technique, we demonstrate improved performance on multiple data sets both in terms of recommendation accuracy and model generation efficiency.

010       An efficient algorithm for finding all possible input nodes for   controlling complex networks
021       Understanding structural controllability of a complex network requires to identify a Minimum Input nodes Set (MIS) of the network. 
020       It has been suggested that finding an MIS is equivalent to computing a maximum matching of the network, where the unmatched nodes constitute an MIS. However, maximum matching of a network is often not unique, and finding all MISs may provide deep insights to the controllability of the network. Finding all possible input nodes, which form the union of all MISs, is computationally challenging for large networks. Here we present an efficient enumerative algorithm for the problem. The main idea is to modify a maximum matching algorithm to make it efficient for finding all possible input nodes by computing only one MIS. We rigorously proved the correctness of the new algorithm and evaluated its performance on synthetic and large real networks. The experimental results showed that the new algorithm ran several orders of magnitude faster than the existing method on large real networks.

010       Any Quantum Network is Structurally Controllable by a Single Driving   Signal
021       Control theory concerns with the question if and how it is possible to drive the behavior of a complex dynamical system. 
020       A system is said to be controllable if we can drive it from any initial state to any desired final state in finite time. For many complex networks, the precise knowledge of system parameters lacks. But, it is possible to make a conclusion about network controllability by inspecting its structure. Classical theory of structural controllability is based on the Lin's structural controllability theorem, which gives necessary and sufficient conditions to conclude if any network is structurally controllable. Due to this fundamental theorem we may identify a minimum driver vertex set, whose control with independent driving signals is sufficient to make the whole system controllable. I show that the Lin's theorem does not impose any limitations on quantum networks structural controllability. By local operations and classical communication, one can modify any quantum network to make it structurally controllable by a single driving signal.

010       Sensitivity and Network Topology in Chemical Reaction Systems
021       In living cells, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by specific enzymes and connect to one another by sharing substrates and products, forming complex networks. 
020       In our previous studies, we established a framework determining the responses to enzyme perturbations only from network topology, and then proved a theorem, called the law of localization, explaining response patterns in terms of network topology. In this paper, we generalize these results to reaction networks with conserved concentrations, which allows us to study any reaction systems. We also propose novel network characteristics quantifying robustness. We compare E. coli metabolic network with randomly rewired networks, and find that the robustness of the E. coli network is significantly higher than that of the random networks.

010       Relating Topological Determinants of Complex Networks to Their Spectral   Properties: Structural and Dynamical Effects
021       The largest eigenvalue of a network's adjacency matrix and its associated principal eigenvector are key elements for determining the topological structure and the properties of dynamical processes mediated by it. 
020       We present a physically grounded expression relating the value of the largest eigenvalue of a given network to the largest eigenvalue of two network subgraphs, considered as isolated: The hub with its immediate neighbors and the densely connected set of nodes with maximum $K$-core index. We validate this formula showing that it predicts with good accuracy the largest eigenvalue of a large set of synthetic and real-world topologies. We also present evidence of the consequences of these findings for broad classes of dynamics taking place on the networks. As a byproduct, we reveal that the spectral properties of heterogeneous networks built according to the linear preferential attachment model are qualitatively different from those of their static counterparts.

010       Pattern formation and transition in complex networks
021       Dynamical patterns in complex networks of coupled oscillators are both of theoretical and practical interest, yet to fully reveal and understand the interplay between pattern emergence and network structure remains to be an outstanding problem. 
020       A fundamental issue is the effect of network structure on the stability of the patterns. We address this issue by using the setting where random links are systematically added to a regular lattice and focusing on the dynamical evolution of spiral wave patterns. As the network structure deviates more from the regular topology (so that it becomes increasingly more complex), the original stable spiral wave pattern can disappear and a different type of pattern can emerge. Our main findings are the following. (1) Short-distance links added to a small region containing the spiral tip can have a more significant effect on the wave pattern than long-distance connections. (2) As more random links are introduced into the network, distinct pattern transitions can occur, which include the transition of spiral wave to global synchronization, to a chimera-like state, and then to a pinned spiral wave. (3) Around the transitions the network dynamics is highly sensitive to small variations in the network structure in the sense that the addition of even a single link can change the pattern from one type to another. These findings provide insights into the pattern dynamics in complex networks, a problem that is relevant to many physical, chemical, and biological systems.

010       Influence of random opinion change in complex networks
021       Opinion formation in the population has attracted extensive research interest. 
020       Various models have been introduced and studied, including the ones with individuals' free will allowing them to change their opinions. Such models, however, have not taken into account the fact that individuals with different opinions may have different levels of loyalty, and consequently, different probabilities of changing their opinions. In this work, we study on how the non-uniform distribution of the opinion changing probability may affect the final state of opinion distribution. By simulating a few different cases with different symmetric and asymmetric non-uniform patterns of opinion changing probabilities, we demonstrate the significant effects that the different loyalty levels of different opinions have on the final state of the opinion distribution.

010       Preliminary Study on Bit-String Modelling of Opinion Formation in   Complex Networks
021       Opinion formation has been gaining increasing research interests recently, and various models have been proposed. 
020       These models, however, have their limitations, among which noticeably include (i) it is generally assumed that adjacent nodes holding similar opinions will further reduce their difference in between, while adjacent nodes holding significantly different opinions would either do nothing, or cut the link in between them; (ii) opinion mutation, which describes "opinion changes not due to neighborhood influences" in real life, is typically random. While such models enjoy their simplicity and nevertheless help reveal lots of useful insights, they lack the capability of describing many complex behaviors which we may easily observe in real life. In this paper, we propose a new bit-string modeling approach. Preliminary study on the new model demonstrates its great potentials in revealing complex behaviors of social opinion evolution and formation.

010       Chimera states in complex networks: interplay of fractal topology and   delay
021       Chimera states are an example of intriguing partial synchronization patterns emerging in networks of identical oscillators. 
020       They consist of spatially coexisting domains of coherent (synchronized) and incoherent (desynchronized) dynamics. We analyze chimera states in networks of Van der Pol oscillators with hierarchical connectivities, and elaborate the role of time delay introduced in the coupling term. In the parameter plane of coupling strength and delay time we find tongue-like regions of existence of chimera states alternating with regions of existence of coherent travelling waves. We demonstrate that by varying the time delay one can deliberately stabilize desired spatio-temporal patterns in the system.

010       Knowledge Acquisition: A Complex Networks Approach
021       Complex networks have been found to provide a good representation of the structure of knowledge, as understood in terms of discoverable concepts and their relationships. 
020       In this context, the discovery process can be modeled as agents walking in a knowledge space. Recent studies proposed more realistic dynamics, including the possibility of agents being influenced by others with higher visibility or by their own memory. However, rather than dealing with these two concepts separately, as previously approached, in this study we propose a multi-agent random walk model for knowledge acquisition that incorporates both concepts. More specifically, we employed the true self avoiding walk alongside a new dynamics based on jumps, in which agents are attracted by the influence of others. That was achieved by using a L\'evy flight influenced by a field of attraction emanating from the agents. In order to evaluate our approach, we use a set of network models and two real networks, one generated from Wikipedia and another from the Web of Science. The results were analyzed globally and by regions. In the global analysis, we found that most of the dynamics parameters do not significantly affect the discovery dynamics. The local analysis revealed a substantial difference of performance depending on the network regions where the dynamics are occurring. In particular, the dynamics at the core of networks tend to be more effective. The choice of the dynamics parameters also had no significant impact to the acquisition performance for the considered knowledge networks, even at the local scale.

010       Centralities in Simplicial Complexes

020       Here we study a transformation of these complex networks into simplicial complexes, where cliques represent the simplices of the complex. We extend the concept of node centrality to that of simplicial centrality and study several mathematical properties of degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, Katz, and subgraph centrality for simplicial complexes. We study the degree distributions of these centralities at the different levels. We also compare and describe the differences between the centralities at the different levels. Using these centralities we study a method for detecting essential proteins in PPI networks of cells and explain the varying abilities of the centrality measures at the different levels in identifying these essential proteins. The paper is written in a self-contained way, such that it can be used by practitioners of network theory as a basis for further developments.

010       Maximum entropy sampling in complex networks
021       Many real-world systems are characterized by stochastic dynamical rules where a complex network of dependencies among individual elements probabilistically determines their state. 
020       Even with full knowledge of the network structure and of the stochastic rules of the dynamical process, the ability to predict system configurations is generally characterized by large uncertainty. Sampling a fraction of the nodes and deterministically observing their state may help to reduce the uncertainty about the unobserved nodes. However, choosing these points of observation with the goal of maximizing predictive power is a highly nontrivial task, depending on the nature of the stochastic process and on the structure of the underlying network. Here, we introduce a computationally efficient algorithm to determine quasi-optimal solutions for arbitrary stochastic processes defined on generic sparse topologies. We show that the method is effective for various processes on different substrates. We further show how the method can be fruitfully used to identify the best nodes to label in semi-supervised probabilistic classification algorithms.

010       Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the International Merger and Acquisition   Network
021       This paper analyses the world web of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) using a complex network approach. 
020       We use data of M&amp;As to build a temporal sequence of binary and weighted-directed networks for the period 1995-2010 and 224 countries (nodes) connected according to their M&amp;As flows (links). We study different geographical and temporal aspects of the international M&amp;A network (IMAN), building sequences of filtered sub-networks whose links belong to specific intervals of distance or time. Given that M&amp;As and trade are complementary ways of reaching foreign markets, we perform our analysis using statistics employed for the study of the international trade network (ITN), highlighting the similarities and differences between the ITN and the IMAN. In contrast to the ITN, the IMAN is a low density network characterized by a persistent giant component with many external nodes and low reciprocity. Clustering patterns are very heterogeneous and dynamic. High-income economies are the main acquirers and are characterized by high connectivity, implying that most countries are targets of a few acquirers. Like in the ITN, geographical distance strongly impacts the structure of the IMAN: link-weights and node degrees have a non-linear relation with distance, and an assortative pattern is present at short distances.

010       Optimal Localization of Diffusion Sources in Complex Networks
021       Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a significant problem in network science with great applied values to the society. 
020       However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient tools with broad applications.

010       Fluctuations in percolation of sparse complex networks
021       We study the role of fluctuations in percolation of sparse complex networks. 
020       To this end we consider two random correlated realizations of the initial damage of the nodes and we evaluate the fraction of nodes that are expected to remain in the giant component of the network in both cases or just in one case. Our framework includes a message-passing algorithm able to predict the fluctuations in a single network, and an analytic prediction of the expected fluctuations in ensembles of sparse networks. This approach is applied to real ecological and infrastructure networks and it is shown to characterize the expected fluctuations in their response to external damage.

010       Joint effect of ageing and multilayer structure prevents ordering in the   voter model
021       The voter model rules are simple, with agents copying the state of a random neighbor, but they lead to non-trivial dynamics. 
020       Besides opinion processes, the model has also applications for catalysis and species competition. Inspired by the temporal inhomogeneities found in human interactions, one can introduce ageing in the agents: the probability to update decreases with the time elapsed since the last change. This modified dynamics induces an approach to consensus via coarsening in complex networks. Additionally, multilayer networks produce profound changes in the dynamics of models. In this work, we investigate how a multilayer structure affects the dynamics of an ageing voter model. The system is studied as a function of the fraction of nodes sharing states across layers (multiplexity parameter q ). We find that the dynamics of the system suffers a notable change at an intermediate value q*. Above it, the voter model always orders to an absorbing configuration. While, below, a fraction of the realizations falls into dynamical traps associated to a spontaneous symmetry breaking in which the majority opinion in the different layers takes opposite signs and that due to the ageing indefinitely delay the arrival at the absorbing state.

010       The joint influence of competition and mutualism on the biodiversity of   mutualistic ecosystems
021       Relations among species in ecosystems can be represented by complex networks where both negative (competition) and positive (mutualism) interactions are concurrently present. 
020       Recently, it has been shown that many ecosystems can be cast into mutualistic networks, and that nestedness reduces effective inter-species competition, thus facilitating mutually beneficial interactions and increasing the number of coexisting species or the biodiversity. However, current approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by adopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive interactions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of multilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and competition. Hence, we abandon the mean field hypothesis and show, through a dynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an intricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, we show that when all interactions are taken into account, mutualism does not have the same consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species. This leads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of competition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our understanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in ecosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical ecology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of mutualistic systems.

010       Promoting information spreading by using contact memory
021       Promoting information spreading is a booming research topic in network science community. 
020       However, the exiting studies about promoting information spreading seldom took into account the human memory, which plays an important role in the spreading dynamics. In this paper we propose a non-Markovian information spreading model on complex networks, in which every informed node contacts a neighbor by using the memory of neighbor's accumulated contact numbers in the past. We systematically study the information spreading dynamics on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of $22$ real-world networks, and find an effective contact strategy of promoting information spreading, i.e., the informed nodes preferentially contact neighbors with small number of accumulated contacts. According to the effective contact strategy, the high degree nodes are more likely to be chosen as the contacted neighbors in the early stage of the spreading, while in the late stage of the dynamics, the nodes with small degrees are preferentially contacted. We also propose a mean-field theory to describe our model, which qualitatively agrees well with the stochastic simulations on both artificial and real-world networks.

010       A Generic Axiomatic Characterization of Centrality Measures in Social   Network
021       Centrality is an important notion in complex networks; it could be used to characterize how influential a node or an edge is in the network. 
020       It plays an important role in several other network analysis tools including community detection. Even though there are a small number of axiomatic frameworks associated with this notion, the existing formalizations are not generic in nature. In this paper we propose a generic axiomatic framework to capture all the intrinsic properties of a centrality measure (a.k.a. centrality index). We analyze popular centrality measures along with other novel measures of centrality using this framework. We observed that none of the centrality measures considered satisfies all the axioms.

010       Randomizing growing networks with a time-respecting null model
021       Complex networks are often used to represent systems that are not static but grow with time: people make new friendships, new papers are published and refer to the existing ones, and so forth. 
020       To assess the statistical significance of measurements made on such networks, we propose a randomization methodology---a time-respecting null model---that preserves both the network's degree sequence and the time evolution of individual nodes' degree values. By preserving the temporal linking patterns of the analyzed system, the proposed model is able to factor out the effect of the system's temporal patterns on its structure. We apply the model to the citation network of Physical Review scholarly papers and the citation network of US movies. The model reveals that the two datasets are strikingly different with respect to their degree-degree correlations, and we discuss the important implications of this finding on the information provided by paradigmatic node centrality metrics such as indegree and Google's PageRank. The randomization methodology proposed here can be used to assess the significance of any structural property in growing networks, which could bring new insights into the problems where null models play a critical role, such as the detection of communities and network motifs.

010       Characterizing Directed and Undirected Networks via Multidimensional   Walks with Jumps
021       Estimating distributions of labels associated with nodes (e.g., number of connections or citizenship of users in a social network) in large graphs via sampling is a vital part of the study of complex networks. 
020       Due to their low cost, sampling via random walks (RWs) has been proposed as an attractive solution to this task. Most RW methods assume either that the network is undirected or that walkers can traverse edges regardless of their direction. Some RW methods have been designed for directed networks where edges coming into a node are not directly observable. In this work, we propose Directed Unbiased Frontier Sampling (DUFS), a sampling method based on a large number of coordinated walkers, each starting from a node chosen uniformly at random. It is applicable to directed networks with invisible incoming edges because it constructs, in real-time, an undirected graph consistent with the walkers trajectories, and due to the use of random jumps which prevent walkers from being trapped. DUFS generalizes previous RW methods and is suited for undirected networks and to directed networks regardless of in-edges visibility. We also propose an improved estimator of vertex label distributions which combines information from the initial walker locations with subsequent RW observations. We evaluate DUFS, comparing it against other RW methods, investigating the impact of its parameters on estimation accuracy and providing practical guidelines for choosing them. In estimating out-degree distributions, DUFS yields significantly better estimates of the head than other methods, while matching or exceeding estimation accuracy of the tail. Last, we show that DUFS outperforms VS when estimating distributions of node labels of the top 10% largest degree nodes, even when uniform vertex sampling has the same cost as RW steps

010       Mixing Time of Random Walk on Poisson Geometry Small World
021       This paper focuses on the problem of modeling for small world effect on complex networks. 
020       Let's consider the supercritical Poisson continuous percolation on $d$-dimensional torus $T^d_n$ with volume $n^d$. By adding "long edges (short cuts)" randomly to the largest percolation cluster, we obtain a random graph $\mathscr G_n$. In the present paper, we first prove that the diameter of $\mathscr G_n$ grows at most polynomially fast in $\ln n$ and we call it the Poisson Geometry Small World. Secondly, we prove that the random walk on $\mathscr G_n$ possesses the rapid mixing property, namely, the random walk mixes in time at most polynomially large in $\ln n$.

We survey the main theory behind complete, generalized and phase synchronization phenomena in simple as well as complex networks and discuss applications to secure communications, parameter estimation and the anticipation of chaos.

010       Accessibility and Delay in Random Temporal Networks
021       In a wide range of complex networks, the links between the nodes are temporal and may sporadically appear and disappear. 
020       This temporality is fundamental to analyze the formation of paths within such networks. Moreover, the presence of the links between the nodes is a random process induced by nature in many real-world networks. In this paper, we study random temporal networks at a microscopic level and formulate the \emph{probability of accessibility} from a node \emph{i} to a node \emph{j} after a certain number of discrete time units $T$. While solving the original problem is computationally intractable, we provide an upper and two lower bounds on this probability for a very general case with arbitrary time-varying probabilities of links' existence. Moreover, for a special case where the links have identical probabilities across the network at each time slot, we obtain the exact probability of accessibility between any two nodes. Finally, we discuss scenarios where the information regarding the presence and absence of links is initially available in the form of time duration (of presence or absence intervals) continuous probability distributions rather than discrete probabilities over time slots. We provide a method for transforming such distributions to discrete probabilities which enables us to apply the given bounds in this paper to a broader range of problem settings.

010       Bi-universality characterizes a realistic spatial network model
021       One of the most powerful findings of statistical physics is the discovery of universality classes which can be used to categorize and predict the behavior of seemingly different systems. 
020       However, many real--world complex networks have not been fitted to the existing universality classes. Here, we study a realistic spatial network model with link-lengths of a characteristic scale $\zeta$. We find that this simple spatial network topology, though not fulfilling the requirements of any single universality class, exhibits a new multiple universality composed of two sets of critical exponents at a unique critical threshold. This bi-universality is characterized by mean--field scaling laws for measurements on a scale smaller than $\zeta$ but spatial scaling for measurements on a larger scale. We verify this multiple universality by measuring the percolation critical exponents $\nu$ (correlation length), $\beta$ (giant component), $\gamma$ (mean mass) as well as scaling relations for chemical vs geometric distance and epidemic dynamics. By introducing the concept of multiple universality we are able to generalize the concept of universality for complex topologies.

010       Computing top-k Closeness Centrality Faster in Unweighted Graphs
021       Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$, the closeness centrality of a vertex $v$ is defined as $\frac{n-1}{\sum_{w \in V} d(v,w)}$. 
020       This measure is widely used in the analysis of real-world complex networks, and the problem of selecting the $k$ most central vertices has been deeply analysed in the last decade. However, this problem is computationally not easy, especially for large networks: in the first part of the paper, we prove that it is not solvable in time $\O(|E|^{2-\epsilon})$ on directed graphs, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, under reasonable complexity assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm for selecting the $k$ most central nodes in a graph: we experimentally show that this algorithm improves significantly both the textbook algorithm, which is based on computing the distance between all pairs of vertices, and the state of the art. For example, we are able to compute the top $k$ nodes in few dozens of seconds in real-world networks with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, as a case study, we compute the $10$ most central actors in the IMDB collaboration network, where two actors are linked if they played together in a movie, and in the Wikipedia citation network, which contains a directed edge from a page $p$ to a page $q$ if $p$ contains a link to $q$.

010       Extremes in Random Graphs Models of Complex Networks
021       Regarding the analysis of Web communication, social and complex networks the fast finding of most influential nodes in a network graph constitutes an important research problem. 
020       We use two indices of the influence of those nodes, namely, PageRank and a Max-linear model. We consider the PageRank %both as %Galton-Watson branching process and as an autoregressive process with a random number of random coefficients that depend on ranks of incoming nodes and their out-degrees and assume that the coefficients are independent and distributed with regularly varying tail and with the same tail index. Then it is proved that the tail index and the extremal index are the same for both PageRank and the Max-linear model and the values of these indices are found. The achievements are based on the study of random sequences of a random length and the comparison of the distribution of their maxima and linear combinations.

010       Optimized Gillespie algorithms for the simulation of Markovian epidemic   processes on large and heterogeneous networks
021       Numerical simulation of continuous-time Markovian processes is an essential and widely applied tool in the investigation of epidemic spreading on complex networks. 
020       Due to the high heterogeneity of the connectivity structure through which epidemics is transmitted, efficient and accurate implementations of generic epidemic processes are not trivial and deviations from statistically exact prescriptions can lead to uncontrolled biases. Based on the Gillespie algorithm (GA), in which only steps that change the state are considered, we develop numerical recipes and describe their computer implementations for statistically exact and computationally efficient simulations of generic Markovian epidemic processes aiming at highly heterogeneous and large networks. The central point of the recipes investigated here is to include phantom processes, that do not change the states but do count for time increments. We compare the efficiencies for the susceptible-infected-susceptible, contact process and susceptible-infected-recovered models, that are particular cases of a generic model considered here. We numerically confirm that the simulation outcomes of the optimized algorithms are statistically indistinguishable from the original GA and can be several orders of magnitude more efficient.

010       Spectra of Laplacian matrices of weighted graphs: structural genericity   properties
021       This article deals with the spectra of Laplacians of weighted graphs. 
020       In this context, two objects are of fundamental importance for the dynamics of complex networks: the second eigenvalue of such a spectrum (called algebraic connectivity) and its associated eigenvector, the so-called Fiedler vector. Here we prove that, given a Laplacian matrix, it is possible to perturb the weights of the existing edges in the underlying graph in order to obtain simple eigenvalues and a Fiedler vector composed of only non-zero entries. These structural genericity properties with the constraint of not adding edges in the underlying graph are stronger than the classical ones, for which arbitrary structural perturbations are allowed. These results open the opportunity to understand the impact of structural changes on the dynamics of complex systems.

010       Electronic structure and magnetic properties of magnetically dead layers   in epitaxial CoFe2O4/Al2O3/Si(111) films studied by X-ray magnetic circular   dichroism
021       Epitaxial CoFe2O4/Al2O3 bilayers are expected to be highly efficient spin injectors into Si owing to the spin filter effect of CoFe2O4. 
020       To exploit the full potential of this system, understanding the microscopic origin of magnetically dead layers at the CoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface is necessary. In this paper, we study the crystallographic and electronic structures and the magnetic properties of CoFe2O4(111) layers with various thicknesses (thickness d = 1.4, 2.3, 4, and 11 nm) in the epitaxial CoFe2O4(111)/Al2O3(111)/Si(111) structures using soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) combined with cluster-model calculation. The magnetization of CoFe2O4 measured by XMCD gradually decreases with decreasing thickness d and finally a magnetically dead layer is clearly detected at d = 1.4 nm. The magnetically dead layer has frustration of magnetic interactions which is revealed from comparison between the magnetizations at 300 and 6 K. From analysis using configuration-interaction cluster-model calculation, the decrease of d leads to a decrease in the inverse-to-normal spinel structure ratio and also a decrease in the average valence of Fe at the octahedral sites. These results strongly indicate that the magnetically dead layer at the CoFe2O4/Al2O3 interface originates from various complex networks of superexchange interactions through the change in the crystallographic and electronic structures. Furthermore, from comparison of the magnetic properties between d = 1.4 and 2.3 nm, it is found that ferrimagnetic order of the magnetically dead layer at d = 1.4 nm is restored by the additional growth of the 0.9-nm-thick CoFe2O4 layer on it.

010       Avalanches and Generalized Memory Associativity in a Network Model for   Conscious and Unconscious Mental Functioning
021       We explore statistical characteristics of avalanches associated with the dynamics of a complex-network model, where two modules corresponding to sensorial and symbolic memories interact, representing unconscious and conscious mental processes. 
020       The model illustrates Freud's ideas regarding the neuroses and that consciousness is related with symbolic and linguistic memory activity in the brain. It incorporates the Stariolo-Tsallis generalization of the Boltzmann Machine in order to model memory retrieval and associativity. In the present work, we define and measure avalanche size distributions during memory retrieval, in order to gain insight regarding basic aspects of the functioning of these complex networks. The avalanche sizes defined for our model should be related to the time consumed and also to the size of the neuronal region which is activated, during memory retrieval. This allows the qualitative comparison of the behaviour of the distribution of cluster sizes, obtained during fMRI measurements of the propagation of signals in the brain, with the distribution of avalanche sizes obtained in our simulation experiments. This comparison corroborates the indication that the Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics formalism may indeed be more well suited to model the complex networks which constitute brain and mental structure.

010       A Memetic Algorithm for the Minimum Conductance Graph Partitioning   Problem
021       The minimum conductance problem is an NP-hard graph partitioning problem. 
020       Apart from the search for bottlenecks in complex networks, the problem is very closely related to the popular area of network community detection. In this paper, we tackle the minimum conductance problem as a pseudo-Boolean optimisation problem and propose a memetic algorithm to solve it. An efficient local search strategy is established. Our memetic algorithm starts by using this local search strategy with different random strings to sample a set of diverse initial solutions. This is followed by an evolutionary phase based on a steady-state framework and two intensification subroutines. We compare the algorithm to a wide range of multi-start local search approaches and classical genetic algorithms with different crossover operators. The experimental results are presented for a diverse set of real-world networks. These results indicate that the memetic algorithm outperforms the alternative stochastic approaches.

010       Phase reduction approach to synchronization of nonlinear oscillators
021       Systems of dynamical elements exhibiting spontaneous rhythms are found in various fields of science and engineering, including physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and mechanical and electrical engineering. 
020       Such dynamical elements are often modeled as nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators. In this article, we briefly review phase reduction theory, which is a simple and powerful method for analyzing the synchronization properties of limit-cycle oscillators exhibiting rhythmic dynamics. Through phase reduction theory, we can systematically simplify the nonlinear multi-dimensional differential equations describing a limit-cycle oscillator to a one-dimensional phase equation, which is much easier to analyze. Classical applications of this theory, i.e., the phase locking of an oscillator to a periodic external forcing and the mutual synchronization of interacting oscillators, are explained. Further, more recent applications of this theory to the synchronization of non-interacting oscillators induced by common noise and the dynamics of coupled oscillators on complex networks are discussed. We also comment on some recent advances in phase reduction theory for noise-driven oscillators and rhythmic spatiotemporal patterns.

010       Node-centric community detection in multilayer networks with   layer-coverage diversification bias
021       The problem of node-centric, or local, community detection in information networks refers to the identification of a community for a given input node, having limited information about the network topology. 
020       Existing methods for solving this problem, however, are not conceived to work on complex networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for local community detection based on the multilayer network model. Our approach relies on the maximization of the ratio between the community internal connection density and the external connection density, according to multilayer similarity-based community relations. We also define a biasing scheme that allows the discovery of local communities characterized by different degrees of layer-coverage diversification. Experimental evaluation conducted on real-world multilayer networks has shown the significance of our approach.

010       Rich-clubness test: how to determine whether a complex network has or   doesn&#x27;t have a rich-club?
021       The rich-club concept has been introduced in order to characterize the presence of a cohort of nodes with a large number of links (rich nodes) that tend to be well connected between each other, creating a tight group (club). 
020       Rich-clubness defines the extent to which a network displays a topological organization characterized by the presence of a node rich-club. It is crucial for the investigation of internal organization and function of networks arising in systems of disparate fields such as transportation, social, communication and neuroscience. Different methods have been proposed for assessing the rich-clubness and various null-models have been adopted for performing statistical tests. However, a procedure that assigns a unique value of rich-clubness significance to a given network is still missing. Our solution to this problem grows on the basis of three new pillars. We introduce: i) a null-model characterized by a lower rich-club coefficient; ii) a fair strategy to normalize the level of rich-clubness of a network in respect to the null-model; iii) a statistical test that, exploiting the maximum deviation of the normalized rich-club coefficient attributes a unique p-value of rich-clubness to a given network. In conclusion, this study proposes the first attempt to quantify, using a unique measure, whether a network presents a significant rich-club topological organization. The general impact of our study on engineering and science is that simulations investigating how the functional performance of a network is changing in relation to rich-clubness might be more easily tuned controlling one unique value: the proposed rich-clubness measure.

010       Higher-order clustering in networks
021       A fundamental property of complex networks is the tendency for edges to cluster. 
020       The extent of the clustering is typically quantified by the clustering coefficient, which is the probability that a length-2 path is closed, i.e., induces a triangle in the network. However, higher-order cliques beyond triangles are crucial to understanding complex networks, and the clustering behavior with respect to such higher-order network structures is not well understood. Here we introduce higher-order clustering coefficients that measure the closure probability of higher-order network cliques and provide a more comprehensive view of how the edges of complex networks cluster. Our higher-order clustering coefficients are a natural generalization of the traditional clustering coefficient. We derive several properties about higher-order clustering coefficients and analyze them under common random graph models. Finally, we use higher-order clustering coefficients to gain new insights into the structure of real-world networks from several domains.

010       A Novel Experimental Platform for In-Vessel Multi-Chemical Molecular   Communications
021       This work presents a new multi-chemical experimental platform for molecular communication where the transmitter can release different chemicals. 
020       This platform is designed to be inexpensive and accessible, and it can be expanded to simulate different environments including the cardiovascular system and complex network of pipes in industrial complexes and city infrastructures. To demonstrate the capabilities of the platform, we implement a time-slotted binary communication system where a bit-0 is represented by an acid pulse, a bit-1 by a base pulse, and information is carried via pH signals. The channel model for this system, which is nonlinear and has long memories, is unknown. Therefore, we devise novel detection algorithms that use techniques from machine learning and deep learning to train a maximum-likelihood detector. Using these algorithms the bit error rate improves by an order of magnitude relative to the approach used in previous works. Moreover, our system achieves a data rate that is an order of magnitude higher than any of the previous molecular communication platforms.

010       Common adversaries form alliances: modelling complex networks via   anti-transitivity
021       Anti-transitivity captures the notion that enemies of enemies are friends, and arises naturally in the study of adversaries in social networks and in the study of conflicting nation states or organizations. 
020       We present a simplified, evolutionary model for anti-transitivity influencing link formation in complex networks, and analyze the model's network dynamics. The Iterated Local Anti-Transitivity (or ILAT) model creates anti-clone nodes in each time-step, and joins anti-clones to the parent node's non-neighbor set. The graphs generated by ILAT exhibit familiar properties of complex networks such as densification, short distances (bounded by absolute constants), and bad spectral expansion. We determine the cop and domination number for graphs generated by ILAT, and finish with an analysis of their clustering coefficients. We interpret these results within the context of real-world complex networks and present open problems.

010       PAFit: an R Package for Estimating Preferential Attachment and Node   Fitness in Temporal Complex Networks
021       Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time. 
020       Preferential attachment and node fitness are two ubiquitous growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications in modeling and inference. In the node fitness mechanism, the probability a node acquires a new edge is proportional to a quantity called fitness that is assumed to be independent of the network structure. On the other hand, in the preferential attachment mechanism, this probability of acquiring new edges is proportional to a function of the current number of edges of the node. While this function is originally assumed to be the linear function, and hence fixed, in general it can be arbitrary, and thus is the target of estimation in real-world datasets. While there are standard statistical packages for estimating the structural properties of complex networks, there is no corresponding package when it comes to the estimation of preferential attachment and node fitness mechanisms. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements well-established statistical methods for estimating preferential attachment and node fitness, as well as a number of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure good performance for large-scale networks. In this paper, we first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit using simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the field of complex networks.

010       Recovery time after localized perturbations in complex dynamical   networks
021       Maintaining the synchronous motion of dynamical systems interacting on complex networks is often critical to their functionality. 
020       However, real-world networked dynamical systems operating synchronously are prone to random perturbations driving the system to arbitrary states within the corresponding basin of attraction, thereby leading to epochs of desynchronized dynamics with a priori unknown durations. Thus, it is highly relevant to have an estimate of the duration of such transient phases before the system returns to synchrony, following a random perturbation to the dynamical state of any particular node of the network. We address this issue here by proposing the framework of \emph{single-node recovery time} (SNRT) which provides an estimate of the relative time scales underlying the transient dynamics of the nodes of a network during its restoration to synchrony. We utilize this in differentiating the particularly \emph{slow} nodes of the network from the relatively \emph{fast} nodes, thus identifying the critical nodes which when perturbed lead to significantly enlarged recovery time of the system before resuming synchronized operation. Further, we reveal explicit relationships between the SNRT values of a network, and its \emph{global relaxation time} when starting all the nodes from random initial conditions. We employ the proposed concept for deducing microscopic relationships between topological features of nodes and their respective SNRT values. The framework of SNRT is further extended to a measure of resilience of the different nodes of a networked dynamical system. We demonstrate the potential of SNRT in networks of R\"{o}ssler oscillators on paradigmatic topologies and a model of the power grid of the United Kingdom with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics illustrating the conceivable practical applicability of the proposed concept.

010       The finite density scaling laws of condensation transition in the   stationary and dynamical zero range processes on scale-free networks
021       The dynamics of zero-range processes on complex networks is expected to be influenced by the underlying topological structure of networks. 
020       A real space complete condensation transition in the stationary state may occur. We have studied the finite density effects of the condensation transition in both the static and dynamical zero-range process on scale-free network. By means of grand canonical ensemble method, the analytical results reveal the existence of novel density dependent scaling laws in the stationary state, as well as in the relaxation dynamics of the condensation transition. We have performed the Monte Carlo simulations and those predicted density scaling laws are nicely validated.

010       Stable Desynchronization for Wireless Sensor Networks: (I) Concepts and   Algorithms
021       Desynchronization is one of the primitive services for complex networks because it arranges nodes to take turns accessing a shared resource. 
020       TDMA is a practical application of desynchronization because it allows node to share a common medium. In this paper, we propose a novel desynchronization algorithm using artificial force field called Multi-hop Desynchronization With an ARtificial Force field or M-DWARF and use it to solve TDMA problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). M-DWARF solves hidden terminal problems in multi-hop networks by using relative time relaying and improves resource utilization by employing force absorption. M-DWARF is suitable for use in WSNs because of its low complexity and autonomous operations. We implement M-DWARF using TinyOS and experiment it on both TelosB motes and TOSSIM. From our investigation, M-DWARF is the only desynchronization algorithm that achieves fast convergence with high stability, while maintaining channel utilization fairness. Moreover, we are the first to provide a stability analysis using dynamical systems and to prove that M-DWARF is stable at equilibrium.

010       Diffusion geometry unravels the emergence of functional clusters in   collective phenomena
021       Collective phenomena emerge from the interaction of natural or artificial units with a complex organization. 
020       The interplay between structural patterns and dynamics might induce functional clusters that, in general, are different from topological ones. In biological systems, like the human brain, the overall functionality is often favored by the interplay between connectivity and synchronization dynamics, with functional clusters that do not coincide with anatomical modules in most cases. In social, socio-technical and engineering systems, the quest for consensus favors the emergence of clusters. <br />Despite the unquestionable evidence for mesoscale organization of many complex systems and the heterogeneity of their inter-connectivity, a way to predict and identify the emergence of functional modules in collective phenomena continues to elude us. Here, we propose an approach based on random walk dynamics to define the diffusion distance between any pair of units in a networked system. Such a metric allows to exploit the underlying diffusion geometry to provide a unifying framework for the intimate relationship between metastable synchronization, consensus and random search dynamics in complex networks, pinpointing the functional mesoscale organization of synthetic and biological systems.

010       Mapping and discrimination of networks in the complexity-entropy plane
021       Complex networks are usually characterized in terms of their topological, spatial, or information-theoretic properties and combinations of the associated metrics are used to discriminate networks into different classes or categories. 
020       However, even with the present variety of characteristics at hand it still remains a subject of current research to appropriately quantify a network's complexity and correspondingly discriminate between different types of complex networks, like infrastructure or social networks, on such a basis. Here, we explore the possibility to classify complex networks by means of a statistical complexity measure that has formerly been successfully applied to distinguish different types of chaotic and stochastic time series. It is composed of a network's averaged per-node entropic measure characterizing the network's information content and the associated Jenson-Shannon divergence as a measure of disequilibrium. We study 29 real world networks and show that networks of the same category tend to cluster in distinct areas of the resulting complexity-entropy plane. We demonstrate that within our framework, connectome networks exhibit among the highest complexity while, e.g, transportation and infrastructure networks display significantly lower values. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our framework by applying it to families of random scale-free and Watts-Strogatz model networks. We then show in a second application that the proposed framework is useful to objectively construct threshold-based networks, such as functional climate networks or recurrence networks, by choosing the threshold such that the statistical network complexity is maximized.

010       Ranking in evolving complex networks
021       Complex networks have emerged as a simple yet powerful framework to represent and analyze a wide range of complex systems. 
020       The problem of ranking the nodes and the edges in complex networks is critical for a broad range of real-world problems because it affects how we access online information and products, how success and talent are evaluated in human activities, and how scarce resources are allocated by companies and policymakers, among others. This calls for a deep understanding of how existing ranking algorithms perform, and which are their possible biases that may impair their effectiveness. Well-established ranking algorithms (such as the popular Google's PageRank) are static in nature and, as a consequence, they exhibit important shortcomings when applied to real networks that rapidly evolve in time. The recent advances in the understanding and modeling of evolving networks have enabled the development of a wide and diverse range of ranking algorithms that take the temporal dimension into account. The aim of this review is to survey the existing ranking algorithms, both static and time-aware, and their applications to evolving networks. We emphasize both the impact of network evolution on well-established static algorithms and the benefits from including the temporal dimension for tasks such as prediction of real network traffic, prediction of future links, and identification of highly-significant nodes.

010       Beyond the network of plants volatile organic compounds
021       Plants emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is involved in a wide class of ecological functions, as VOCs play a crucial role in plants interactions with biotic and abiotic factors. 
020       Accordingly, they vary widely across species and underpin differences in ecological strategy. In this paper, VOCs spontaneously emitted by 109 plant species (belonging to 56 different families) have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in order to classify plants species. By using bipartite networks methodology, based on recent advancements in Complex Network Theory, and through the application of complementary classical and advanced community detection algorithms, the possibility to classify species according to chemical classes such as terpenes and sulfur compounds is suggested. This indicates complex network analysis as an advantageous methodology to uncover plants relationships also related to the way they react to the environment where they evolve and adapt.

010       Enriching Complex Networks with Word Embeddings for Detecting Mild   Cognitive Impairment from Speech Transcripts
021       Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a mental disorder difficult to diagnose. 
020       Linguistic features, mainly from parsers, have been used to detect MCI, but this is not suitable for large-scale assessments. MCI disfluencies produce non-grammatical speech that requires manual or high precision automatic correction of transcripts. In this paper, we modeled transcripts into complex networks and enriched them with word embedding (CNE) to better represent short texts produced in neuropsychological assessments. The network measurements were applied with well-known classifiers to automatically identify MCI in transcripts, in a binary classification task. A comparison was made with the performance of traditional approaches using Bag of Words (BoW) and linguistic features for three datasets: DementiaBank in English, and Cinderella and Arizona-Battery in Portuguese. Overall, CNE provided higher accuracy than using only complex networks, while Support Vector Machine was superior to other classifiers. CNE provided the highest accuracies for DementiaBank and Cinderella, but BoW was more efficient for the Arizona-Battery dataset probably owing to its short narratives. The approach using linguistic features yielded higher accuracy if the transcriptions of the Cinderella dataset were manually revised. Taken together, the results indicate that complex networks enriched with embedding is promising for detecting MCI in large-scale assessments

010       Character Networks and Book Genre Classification
021       We compare the social character networks of biographical, legendary and fictional texts, in search of statistical marks of historical information. 
020       We examine the frequency of character appearance and find a Zipf Law that does not depend on the literary genera and historical content. We also examine global and local complex networks indexes, in particular, correlation plots between the recently introduced Lobby (or Hirsh $H(1)$) index and Degree, Betweenness and Closeness centralities. We also found no relevant differences in the books for these network indexes. We discovered, however, that a very simple index based in the Hapax Legomena phenomenon (names cited a single time along the text) that seems to have the potential of separating pure fiction from legendary and biographical texts.

010       Predicting language diversity with complex network
021       Evolution and propagation of the world's languages is a complex phenomenon, driven, to a large extent, by social interactions. 
020       Multilingual society can be seen as a system of interacting agents, where the interaction leads to a modification of the language spoken by the individuals. Two people can reach the state of full linguistic compatibility due to the positive interactions, like transfer of loanwords. But, on the other hand, if they speak entirely different languages, they will separate from each other. These simple observations make the network science the most suitable framework to describe and analyze dynamics of language change. Although many mechanisms have been explained, we lack a qualitative description of the scaling behavior for different sizes of a population. Here we address the issue of the language diversity in societies of different sizes, and we show that local interactions are crucial to capture characteristics of the empirical data. We propose a model of social interactions, extending the idea from, that explains the growth of the language diversity with the size of a population of country or society. We argue that high clustering and network disintegration are the most important characteristics of models properly describing empirical data. Furthermore, we cancel the contradiction between previous models and the Solomon Islands case. Our results demonstrate the importance of the topology of the network, and the rewiring mechanism in the process of language change.

010       Determining the minimum embedding dimension for state space   reconstruction through recurrence networks
021       The analysis of observed time series from nonlinear systems is usually done by making a time-delay reconstruction to unfold the dynamics on a multi-dimensional state space. 
020       An important aspect of the analysis is the choice of the correct embedding dimension. The conventional procedure used for this is either the method of false nearest neighbors or the saturation of some invariant measure, such as, correlation dimension. Here we examine this issue from a complex network perspective and propose a recurrence network based measure to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension to be used for such analysis. The measure proposed here is based on the well known Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in information theory. We show that the measure is simple and direct to compute and give accurate result for short time series. To show the significance of the measure in the analysis of practical data, we present the analysis of two EEG signals as examples.

010       Scale-free behavior of networks with the copresence of preferential and   uniform attachment rules
021       Complex networks in different areas exhibit degree distributions with heavy upper tail. 
020       A preferential attachment mechanism in a growth process produces a graph with this feature. We herein investigate a variant of the simple preferential attachment model, whose modifications are interesting for two main reasons: to analyze more realistic models and to study the robustness of the scale free behavior of the degree distribution. We introduce and study a model which takes into account two different attachment rules: a preferential attachment mechanism (with probability 1-p) that stresses the rich get richer system, and a uniform choice (with probability p) for the most recent nodes. The latter highlights a trend to select one of the last added nodes when no information is available. The recent nodes can be either a given fixed number or a proportion (\alpha n) of the total number of existing nodes. In the first case, we prove that this model exhibits an asymptotically power-law degree distribution. The same result is then illustrated through simulations in the second case. When the window of recent nodes has constant size, we herein prove that the presence of the uniform rule delays the starting time from which the asymptotic regime starts to hold. The mean number of nodes of degree k and the asymptotic degree distribution are also determined analytically. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the model is performed.

010       Epidemic Extinction Paths in Complex Networks
021       We study the extinction of long-lived epidemics on finite complex networks induced by intrinsic noise. 
020       Applying analytical techniques to the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model, we predict the distribution of large fluctuations, the most probable, or optimal path through a network that leads to a disease-free state from an endemic state, and the average extinction time in general configurations. Our predictions agree with Monte-Carlo simulations on several networks, including synthetic weighted and degree-distributed networks with degree correlations, and an empirical high school contact network. In addition, our approach quantifies characteristic scaling patterns for the optimal path and distribution of large fluctuations, both near and away from the epidemic threshold, in networks with heterogeneous eigenvector centrality and degree distributions.

010       When to target hubs? Strategic Diffusion in Complex Networks
021       What is the most effective way to spread a behavior on a network? The recent literature on network diffusion has focused mostly on models of simple contagion---where contagion can result from contact with a single "infected" individual---and complex contagion---where contagion requires contact with multiple "infected" sources. 
020       While in the case of simple contagion, strategies focused on central nodes are known to be effective, the strategies that are most effective in the case of complex contagion are relatively unknown. Here, we study the strategies that optimize the diffusion of a behavior on a network in the case of complex contagion by comparing algorithms that choose which nodes to target at each step. We find that, contrary to the case of simple contagion, where targeting central nodes is an effective strategy, in the case of complex contagion minimizing the total diffusion time requires the use of dynamic strategies targeting less connected nodes in the beginning and hubs at a critical intermediate time. That is, the strategic question in the case of complex contagion is not who to target, but when to target hubs. We solve the model analytically for simple network structures and also use numerical simulations to show that these dynamic strategies outperform simpler strategies that could be hypothesized to be effective, like always choosing the node with the highest probability of infection. These findings shed light on the dynamic strategies that optimize network diffusion in the case of complex contagion.

010       Labelled network subgraphs reveal stylistic subtleties in written texts
021       The vast amount of data and increase of computational capacity have allowed the analysis of texts from several perspectives, including the representation of texts as complex networks. 
020       Nodes of the network represent the words, and edges represent some relationship, usually word co-occurrence. Even though networked representations have been applied to study some tasks, such approaches are not usually combined with traditional models relying upon statistical paradigms. Because networked models are able to grasp textual patterns, we devised a hybrid classifier, called labelled subgraphs, that combines the frequency of common words with small structures found in the topology of the network, known as motifs. Our approach is illustrated in two contexts, authorship attribution and translationese identification. In the former, a set of novels written by different authors is analyzed. To identify translationese, texts from the Canadian Hansard and the European parliament were classified as to original and translated instances. Our results suggest that labelled subgraphs are able to represent texts and it should be further explored in other tasks, such as the analysis of text complexity, language proficiency, and machine translation.

010       Influence maximization on correlated networks through community   identification
021       The identification of the minimal set of nodes that maximizes the propagation of information is one of the most important problems in network science. 
020       In this paper, we introduce a new method to find the set of initial spreaders to maximize the information propagation in complex networks. We evaluate this method in assortative networks and verify that degree-degree correlation plays a fundamental role on the spreading dynamics. Simulation results show that our algorithm is statistically similar, in terms of the average size of outbreaks, to the greedy approach. However, our method is much less time consuming than the greedy algorithm.

010       K-Geodetic Graphs and their Applications to Analysis across Different   Scales of Dynamics of Complex Systems
021       This paper describes a new approach to the problem of the structural research of clusters based on the theory of geodetic and k-geodetic graphs. 
020       We firmly believe that this same approach can be used when solving problems of correlation between structural and spectral metrics in complex networks. So, what we want to point out is about the possibility of applying one theory of networks (the theory of k-geodetic networks) to the solution of problems in another type of networks (complex networks). The theory of geodetic graphs and their various modifications represents an important tool for the structural analysis of complex systems of transmission, processing, and analysis of information. In the case of large data sets, their stochastic dependence is described by large-dimensional correlation matrices. One of the problems of correlation analysis is the study of the structure of the correlation matrix. It is proved that such a structure is adequately described by geodetic graphs. The obtained structural data allow solving the choice problem of significant variables in multidimensional regression models.

010       Neural Embeddings of Graphs in Hyperbolic Space
021       Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
020       They provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves performance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets.

010       On the &quot;Calligraphy&quot; of Books
021       Authorship attribution is a natural language processing task that has been widely studied, often by considering small order statistics. 
020       In this paper, we explore a complex network approach to assign the authorship of texts based on their mesoscopic representation, in an attempt to capture the flow of the narrative. Indeed, as reported in this work, such an approach allowed the identification of the dominant narrative structure of the studied authors. This has been achieved due to the ability of the mesoscopic approach to take into account relationships between different, not necessarily adjacent, parts of the text, which is able to capture the story flow. The potential of the proposed approach has been illustrated through principal component analysis, a comparison with the chance baseline method, and network visualization. Such visualizations reveal individual characteristics of the authors, which can be understood as a kind of calligraphy.

010       Topological electronic properties of silicon
021       The central role that materials play in human history is exemplified by the three-age division of prehistory into the stone, bronze, and iron ages. 
020       References to our present time as the information age or silicon age epitomizes the important role that this semiconducting material came to play in the development of computers and devices that permeate our daily lives. Remarkably, silicon has been left out of the explosion of research activity on topological materials. On the surface, this omission is the result of a boundary-centric classification of undoped silicon as a "trivial insulator". Here we show that the electronic states in silicon have nontrivial topological structures that are captured by a network of Berry flux lines that link at points of high symmetry in the Brillouin zone. This complex network has ice-nodal points where fluxes satisfy ice rules. Fixing the longitudinal momentum parallel to such flux lines yields a two-dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian for the transverse degrees of freedom. This complex Berry-flux network implies a topologically stable two-fold degeneracy along the X-W direction in all of silicon bands, a fact that is supported by crystal symmetry arguments as well as direct inspection of the vast literature on silicon band structures.

020       The correlation structures of the fluctuations at different magnitudes have unique properties. The cross-correlations among small fluctuations are much stronger than those among large fluctuations. The large and small fluctuations are dominated by different groups of stocks. We use complex network representation to study these q-dependent matrices and discover some new identities. By utilizing those q-dependent correlation-based networks, we are able to construct some portfolio by those most independent stocks which consistently perform the best. The optimal multifractal order for portfolio optimization is approximately $q=2$. These results have deepened our understanding about the collective behaviors of the complex financial system.

010       Statistical properties of random clique networks
021       In this paper, a random clique network model to mimic the large clustering coefficient and the modular structure that exist in many real complex networks, such as social networks, artificial networks, and protein interaction networks, is introduced by combining the random selection rule of the Erd\"os and R\'enyi (ER) model and the concept of cliques. 
020       We find that random clique networks having a small average degree differ from the ER network in that they have a large clustering coefficient and a power law clustering spectrum, while networks having a high average degree have similar properties as the ER model. In addition, we find that the relation between the clustering coefficient and the average degree shows a non-monotonic behavior and that the degree distributions can be fit by multiple Poisson curves; we explain the origin of such novel behaviors and degree distributions.

010       Mechanisms for tuning clustering and degree-correlations in directed   networks
021       With complex networks emerging as an effective tool to tackle multidisciplinary problems, models of network generation have gained an importance of their own. 
020       These models allow us to extensively analyze the data obtained from real-world networks, study their relevance and corroborate theoretical results. In this work, we introduce methods, based on degree preserving rewiring, that can be used to tune the clustering and degree-correlations in directed networks with random and scale-free topologies. They provide null-models to investigate the role of the mentioned properties along with their strengths and limitations. We find that in the case of clustering, structural relationships, that are independent of topology and rewiring schemes are revealed, while in the case of degree-correlations, the network topology is found to play an important role in the working of the mechanisms. We also study the effects of link-density on the efficiency of these rewiring mechanisms and find that in the case of clustering, the topology of the network plays an important role in determining how link-density affects the rewiring process, while in the case of degree-correlations, the link-density and topology, play no role for sufficiently large number of rewiring steps. Besides the intended purpose of tuning network properties, the proposed mechanisms can also be used as a tool to reveal structural relationships and topological constraints.

021       We study the occurrence of frequency synchronised states with tunable emergent frequencies in a network of connected systems. 
020       This is achieved by the interplay between time scales of nonlinear dynamical systems connected to form a network, where out of N systems, m evolve on a slower time scale. In such systems, in addition to frequency synchronised states, we also observe amplitude death, synchronised clusters and multifrequency states. We report an interesting cross over behaviour from fast to slow collective dynamics as the number of slow systems m increases. The transition to amplitude death is analysed in detail for minimal network configurations of 3 and 4 systems which actually form possible motifs of the full network.

010       Effects of spatial smoothing on functional brain networks
021       Graph-theoretical methods have rapidly become a standard tool in studies of the structure and function of the human brain. 
020       Whereas the structural connectome can be fairly straightforwardly mapped onto a complex network, there are more degrees of freedom in constructing networks that represent functional connections between brain areas. For fMRI data, such networks are typically built by aggregating the BOLD signal time series of voxels into larger entities (such as Regions of Interest in some brain atlas), and determining the connection strengths between these from some measure of time-series correlations. Although it is evident that the outcome of this procedure must be affected by how the voxel-level time series are treated at the preprocessing stage, there is a lack of systematic studies of the effects of preprocessing on network structure. Here, we focus on the effects of spatial smoothing, which is a standard preprocessing method for fMRI. We apply various levels of spatial smoothing to resting-state fMRI data, and measure the changes induced in the corresponding functional networks. We show that the level of spatial smoothing clearly affects the degrees and other centrality measures of the nodes of the functional networks; these changes are non-uniform, systematic, and depend on the geometry of the brain. The composition of the largest connected network component is also affected in a way that artificially increases the similarity of the networks of different subjects. Our conclusion is that wherever possible, spatial smoothing should be avoided when preprocessing fMRI data for network analysis.

010       Hidden space reconstruction inspires link prediction in complex networks
021       As a fundamental challenge in vast disciplines, link prediction aims to identify potential links in a network based on the incomplete observed information, which has broad applications ranging from uncovering missing protein-protein interaction to predicting the evolution of networks. 
020       One of the most influential methods rely on similarity indices characterized by the common neighbors or its variations. We construct a hidden space mapping a network into Euclidean space based solely on the connection structures of a network. Compared with real geographical locations of nodes, our reconstructed locations are in conformity with those real ones. The distances between nodes in our hidden space could serve as a novel similarity metric in link prediction. In addition, we hybrid our hidden space method with other state-of-the-art similarity methods which substantially outperforms the existing methods on the prediction accuracy. Hence, our hidden space reconstruction model provides a fresh perspective to understand the network structure, which in particular casts a new light on link prediction.

010       Rich-Club Ordering and the Dyadic Effect: Two Interrelated Phenomena
021       Rich-club ordering and the dyadic effect are two phenomena observed in complex networks that are based on the presence of certain substructures composed of specific nodes. 
020       Rich-club ordering represents the tendency of highly connected and important elements to form tight communities with other central elements. The dyadic effect denotes the tendency of nodes that share a common property to be much more interconnected than expected. In this study, we consider the interrelation between these two phenomena, which until now have always been studied separately. We contribute with a new formulation of the rich-club measures in terms of the dyadic effect. Moreover, we introduce certain measures related to the analysis of the dyadic effect, which are useful in confirming the presence and relevance of rich-clubs in complex networks. In addition, certain computational experiences show the usefulness of the introduced quantities with regard to different classes of real networks.

010       Intermittent Granular Dynamics at a Seismogenic Plate Boundary
021       Earthquakes at seismogenic plate boundaries are a response to the differential motions of tectonic blocks embedded within a geometrically complex network of branching and coalescing faults. 
020       Elastic strain is accumulated at a slow strain rate of the order of $10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$, and released intermittently at intervals $&gt;100$ years, in the form of rapid (seconds to minutes) coseismic ruptures. The development of macroscopic models of quasi-static planar tectonic dynamics at these plate boundaries has remained challenging due to uncertainty with regard to the spatial and kinematic complexity of fault system behaviors. In particular, the characteristic length scale of kinematically distinct tectonic structures is poorly constrained. Here we analyze fluctuations in GPS recordings of interseismic velocities from the southern California plate boundary, identifying heavy-tailed scaling behavior. This suggests that the plate boundary can be understood as a densely packed granular medium near the jamming transition, with a characteristic length scale of $91 \pm 20$ km. In this picture fault and block systems may rapidly rearrange the distribution of forces within them, driving a mixture of transient and intermittent fault slip behaviors over tectonic time scales.

010       Experimental bilocality violation without shared reference frames
021       Non-classical correlations arising in complex quantum networks are attracting growing interest, both from a fundamental perspective and for potential applications in information processing. 
020       In particular, in an entanglement swapping scenario a new kind of correlations arise, the so-called nonbilocal correlations that are incompatible with local realism augmented with the assumption that the sources of states used in the experiment are independent. In practice, however, bilocality tests impose strict constraints on the experimental setup and in particular to presence of shared reference frames between the parties. Here, we experimentally address this point showing that false positive nonbilocal quantum correlations can be observed even though the sources of states are independent. To overcome this problem, we propose and demonstrate a new scheme for the violation of bilocality that does not require shared reference frames and thus constitute an important building block for future investigations of quantum correlations in complex networks.

010       A complex network analysis of ethnic conflicts and human rights   violations
021       News reports in media contain records of a wide range of socio-economic and political events in time. 
020       Using a publicly available, large digital database of news records, and aggregating them over time, we study the network of ethnic conflicts and human rights violations. Complex network analyses of the events and the involved actors provide important insights on the engaging actors, groups, establishments and sometimes nations, pointing at their long range effect over space and time. We find power law decays in distributions of actor mentions, co-actor mentions and degrees and dominance of influential actors and groups. Most influential actors or groups form a giant connected component which grows in time, and is expected to encompass all actors globally in the long run. We demonstrate how targeted removal of actors may help stop spreading unruly events. We study the cause-effect relation between types of events, and our quantitative analysis confirm that ethnic conflicts lead to human rights violations, while it does not support the converse.

010       SILVar: Single Index Latent Variable Models
021       A semi-parametric, non-linear regression model in the presence of latent variables is introduced. 
020       These latent variables can correspond to unmodeled phenomena or unmeasured agents in a complex networked system. This new formulation allows joint estimation of certain non-linearities in the system, the direct interactions between measured variables, and the effects of unmodeled elements on the observed system. The particular form of the model adopted is justified, and learning is posed as a regularized maximum likelihood estimation. This leads to classes of structured convex optimization problems with a "sparse plus low-rank" flavor. Relations between the proposed model and several common model paradigms, such as those of Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Vector Autoregression (VAR), are established. Particularly in the VAR setting, the low-rank contributions can come from broad trends exhibited in the time series. Details of the algorithm for learning the model are presented. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the model and the estimation algorithm on simulated and real data.

010       Coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space unsupervisedly discloses   the hidden geometry of the brain
021       The human brain displays a complex network topology, whose structural organization is widely studied using diffusion tensor imaging. 
020       The original geometry from which emerges the network topology is known, as well as the localization of the network nodes in respect to the brain morphology and anatomy. One of the most challenging problems of current network science is to infer the latent geometry from the mere topology of a complex network. The human brain structural connectome represents the perfect benchmark to test algorithms aimed to solve this problem. Coalescent embedding was recently designed to map a complex network in the hyperbolic space, inferring the node angular coordinates. Here we show that this methodology is able to unsupervisedly reconstruct the latent geometry of the brain with an incredible accuracy and that the intrinsic geometry of the brain networks strongly relates to the lobes organization known in neuroanatomy. Furthermore, coalescent embedding allowed the detection of geometrical pathological changes in the connectomes of Parkinson's Disease patients. The present study represents the first evidence of brain networks' angular coalescence in the hyperbolic space, opening a completely new perspective, possibly towards the realization of latent geometry network markers for evaluation of brain disorders and pathologies.

010       Analysing Human Mobility Patterns of Hiking Activities through Complex   Network Theory
021       The exploitation of high volume of geolocalized data from social sport tracking applications of outdoor activities can be useful for natural resource planning and to understand the human mobility patterns during leisure activities. 
020       This geolocalized data represents the selection of hike activities according to subjective and objective factors such as personal goals, personal abilities, trail conditions or weather conditions. In our approach, human mobility patterns are analysed from trajectories which are generated by hikers. We propose the generation of the trail network identifying special points in the overlap of trajectories. Trail crossings and trailheads define our network and shape topological features. We analyse the trail network of Balearic Islands, as a case of study, using complex weighted network theory. The analysis is divided into the four seasons of the year to observe the impact of weather conditions on the network topology. The number of visited places does not decrease despite the large difference in the number of samples of the two seasons with larger and lower activity. It is in summer season where it is produced the most significant variation in the frequency and localization of activities from inland regions to coastal areas. Finally, we compare our model with other related studies where the network possesses a different purpose. One finding of our approach is the detection of regions with relevant importance where landscape interventions can be applied in function of the communities.

010       Topology-dependent rationality and quantal response equilibria in   structured populations
021       Given that the assumption of perfect rationality is rarely met in the real world, we explore a graded notion of rationality in socioecological systems of networked actors. 
020       We parametrize an actors' rationality via their place in a social network and quantify system rationality via the average Jensen-Shannon divergence between the games Nash and logit quantal response equilibria. Previous work has argued that scale-free topologies maximize a system's overall rationality in this setup. Here we show that while, for certain games, it is true that increasing degree heterogeneity of complex networks enhances rationality, rationality-optimal configurations are not scale-free. For the Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt games, we provide analytic arguments complemented by numerical optimization experiments to demonstrate that core-periphery networks composed of a few dominant hub nodes surrounded by a periphery of very low degree nodes give strikingly smaller overall deviations from rationality than scale-free networks. Similarly, for the Battle of the Sexes and the Matching Pennies games, we find that the optimal network structure is also a core-periphery graph but with a smaller difference in the average degrees of the core and the periphery. These results provide insight on the interplay between the topological structure of socioecological systems and their collective cognitive behavior, with potential applications to understanding wealth inequality and the structural features of the network of global corporate control.

010       Sensitivity of directed networks to the addition and pruning of edges   and vertices
021       We study the sensitivity of directed complex networks to the addition and pruning of edges and vertices and introduce the susceptibility, which quantifies this sensitivity. 
020       We show that topologically different parts of a directed network have different sensitivity to the addition and pruning of edges and vertices and, therefore, they are characterized by different susceptibilities. These susceptibilities diverge at the critical point of the directed percolation transition, signaling the appearance (or disappearance) of the giant strongly connected component in the infinite size limit. We demonstrate this behavior in randomly damaged real and synthetic directed complex networks, such as the World Wide Web, Twitter, the \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} neural network, directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and others. We reveal a non-monotonous dependence of the sensitivity to random pruning of edges or vertices in the case of \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans} and Twitter that manifests specific structural peculiarities of these networks. We propose the measurements of the susceptibilities during the addition or pruning of edges and vertices as a new method for studying structural peculiarities of directed networks.

010       Understanding Information Transmission in Complex Networks
021       Information Theory concepts and methodologies conform the background of how communication systems are studied and understood. 
020       They are mainly focused on the source-channel-receiver problem and on the asymptotic limits of accuracy and communication rates, which are the classical problems studied by Shannon. However, the impact of Information Theory on networks (acting as the channel) is just starting. Here, we present an approach to understand how information flows in any connected complex network. Our approach is based on defining linear conservative flows that travel through the network from source to receiver. This framework allows us to have an analytical description of the problem and also linking the topological invariants of the network, such as the node degree, with the information flow. In particular, our approach is able to deal with information transmission in modular networks (networks containing community structures) or multiplex networks (networks with multiple layers), which are nowadays of paramount importance.

010       Community structure of copper supply networks in the prehistoric   Balkans: An independent evaluation of the archaeological record from the 7th   to the 4th millennium BC
021       Complex networks analyses of many physical, biological and social phenomena show remarkable structural regularities, yet, their application in studying human past interaction remains underdeveloped. 
020       Here, we present an innovative method for identifying community structures in the archaeological record that allow for independent evaluation of the copper using societies in the Balkans, from c. 6200 to c. 3200 BC. We achieve this by exploring modularity of networked systems of these societies across an estimated 3000 years. We employ chemical data of copper-based objects from 79 archaeological sites as the independent variable for detecting most densely interconnected sets of nodes with a modularity maximization method. Our results reveal three dominant modular structures across the entire period, which exhibit strong spatial and temporal significance. We interpret patterns of copper supply among prehistoric societies as reflective of social relations, which emerge as equally important as physical proximity. Although designed on a variable isolated from any archaeological and spatiotemporal information, our method provides archaeologically and spatiotemporally meaningful results. It produces models of human interaction and cooperation that can be evaluated independently of established archaeological systematics, and can find wide application on any quantitative data from archaeological and historical record.

010       Multi-Scale Factor Analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Signals
021       In this paper, we develop an approach to modeling high-dimensional networks with a large number of nodes arranged in a hierarchical and modular structure. 
020       We propose a novel multi-scale factor analysis (MSFA) model which partitions the massive spatio-temporal data defined over the complex networks into a finite set of regional clusters. To achieve further dimension reduction, we represent the signals in each cluster by a small number of latent factors. The correlation matrix for all nodes in the network are approximated by lower-dimensional sub-structures derived from the cluster-specific factors. To estimate regional connectivity between numerous nodes (within each cluster), we apply principal components analysis (PCA) to produce factors which are derived as the optimal reconstruction of the observed signals under the squared loss. Then, we estimate global connectivity (between clusters or sub-networks) based on the factors across regions using the RV-coefficient as the cross-dependence measure. This gives a reliable and computationally efficient multi-scale analysis of both regional and global dependencies of the large networks. The proposed novel approach is applied to estimate brain connectivity networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Results on resting-state fMRI reveal interesting modular and hierarchical organization of human brain networks during rest.

010       The Ties that Bind Networks: Weak Ties Facilitate the Emergence of   Collective Memories
021       From families to nations, what binds individuals in social groups is the degree to which they share beliefs, norms, and memories. 
020       While local clusters of communicating individuals can sustain shared memories and norms, communities characterized by isolated cliques are susceptible to information fragmentation and polarization dynamics. We employ experimental manipulations in lab-created communities to investigate how the temporal dynamics of conversational interactions can shape the formation of collective memories. We show that when individuals that bridge cliques (i.e., weak ties) communicate early on in a series of networked interactions, the community reaches higher mnemonic convergence compared to when individuals first interact within cliques (i.e., strong ties). This, we find, is due to the tradeoffs between information diversity and accumulated overlap over time. By using data calibrated models, we extend these findings to a larger and more complex network structure. Our approach offers a framework to analyze and design interventions in communication networks that optimize shared remembering and diminish the likelihood of information bubbles and polarization.

010       Modeling spatial social complex networks for dynamical processes
021       The study of social networks --- where people are located, geographically, and how they might be connected to one another --- is a current hot topic of interest, because of its immediate relevance to important applications, from devising efficient immunization techniques for the arrest of epidemics, to the design of better transportation and city planning paradigms, to the understanding of how rumors and opinions spread and take shape over time. 
020       We develop a spatial social complex network (SSCN) model that captures not only essential connectivity features of real-life social networks, including a heavy-tailed degree distribution and high clustering, but also the spatial location of individuals, reproducing Zipf's law for the distribution of city populations as well as other observed hallmarks. We then simulate Milgram's Small-World experiment on our SSCN model, obtaining good qualitative agreement with the known results and shedding light on the role played by various network attributes and the strategies used by the players in the game. This demonstrates the potential of the SSCN model for the simulation and study of the many social processes mentioned above, where both connectivity and geography play a role in the dynamics.

Using methods in complex network theory and statistical physics we are able to discriminate PTNs with respect to their stability; which is the first of this kind for national networks. Moreover, taking advantage of various fractal properties we gain useful insights into the serviceable area of stations. These features can be employed as key performance indicators in aid of further developing efficient and stable PTNs.

010       Feedback inhibition shapes emergent computational properties of cortical   microcircuit motifs
021       Cortical microcircuits are very complex networks, but they are composed of a relatively small number of stereotypical motifs. 
020       Hence one strategy for throwing light on the computational function of cortical microcircuits is to analyze emergent computational properties of these stereotypical microcircuit motifs. We are addressing here the question how spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) shapes the computational properties of one motif that has frequently been studied experimentally: interconnected populations of pyramidal cells and parvalbumin-positive inhibitory cells in layer 2/3. Experimental studies suggest that these inhibitory neurons exert some form of divisive inhibition on the pyramidal cells. We show that this data-based form of feedback inhibition, which is softer than that of winner-take-all models that are commonly considered in theoretical analyses, contributes to the emergence of an important computational function through STDP: The capability to disentangle superimposed firing patterns in upstream networks, and to represent their information content through a sparse assembly code.

010       Right-side-stretched multifractal spectra indicate small-worldness in   networks
021       Complex network formalism allows to explain the behavior of systems composed by interacting units. 
020       Several prototypical network models have been proposed thus far. The small-world model has been introduced to mimic two important features observed in real-world systems: i) local clustering and ii) the possibility to move across a network by means of long-range links that significantly reduce the characteristic path length. A natural question would be whether there exist several "types" of small-world architectures, giving rise to a continuum of models with properties (partially) shared with other models belonging to different network families. Here, we take advantage of the interplay between network theory and time series analysis and propose to investigate small-world signatures in complex networks by analyzing multifractal characteristics of time series generated from such networks. In particular, we suggest that the degree of right-sided asymmetry of multifractal spectra is linked with the degree of small-worldness present in networks. This claim is supported by numerical simulations performed on several parametric models, including prototypical small-world networks, scale-free, fractal and also real-world networks describing protein molecules. Our results also indicate that right-sided asymmetry emerges with the presence of the following topological properties: low edge density, low average shortest path, and high clustering coefficient.

010       Online Factorization and Partition of Complex Networks From Random Walks
021       Finding the reduced-dimensional structure is critical to understanding complex networks. 
020       Existing approaches such as spectral clustering are applicable only when the full network is explicitly observed. In this paper, we focus on the online factorization and partition of implicit large-scale networks based on observations from an associated random walk. We formulate this into a nonconvex stochastic factorization problem and propose an efficient and scalable stochastic generalized Hebbian algorithm. The algorithm is able to process dependent state-transition data dynamically generated by the underlying network and learn a low-dimensional representation for each vertex. By applying a diffusion approximation analysis, we show that the continuous-time limiting process of the stochastic algorithm converges globally to the "principal components" of the Markov chain and achieves a nearly optimal sample complexity. Once given the learned low-dimensional representations, we further apply clustering techniques to recover the network partition. We show that when the associated Markov process is lumpable, one can recover the partition exactly with high probability. We apply the proposed approach to model the traffic flow of Manhattan as city-wide random walks. By using our algorithm to analyze the taxi trip data, we discover a latent partition of the Manhattan city that closely matches the traffic dynamics.

010       Predicting stock market movements using network science: An information   theoretic approach
021       A stock market is considered as one of the highly complex systems, which consists of many components whose prices move up and down without having a clear pattern. 
020       The complex nature of a stock market challenges us on making a reliable prediction of its future movements. In this paper, we aim at building a new method to forecast the future movements of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (S&amp;P 500) by constructing time-series complex networks of S&amp;P 500 underlying companies by connecting them with links whose weights are given by the mutual information of 60-minute price movements of the pairs of the companies with the consecutive 5,340 minutes price records. We showed that the changes in the strength distributions of the networks provide an important information on the network's future movements. We built several metrics using the strength distributions and network measurements such as centrality, and we combined the best two predictors by performing a linear combination. We found that the combined predictor and the changes in S&amp;P 500 show a quadratic relationship, and it allows us to predict the amplitude of the one step future change in S&amp;P 500. The result showed significant fluctuations in S&amp;P 500 Index when the combined predictor was high. In terms of making the actual index predictions, we built ARIMA models. We found that adding the network measurements into the ARIMA models improves the model accuracy. These findings are useful for financial market policy makers as an indicator based on which they can interfere with the markets before the markets make a drastic change, and for quantitative investors to improve their forecasting models.

010       Deep Complex Networks
021       At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. 
020       However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional LSTMs. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech Spectrum Prediction using the TIMIT dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks.

010       Multiscale unfolding of real networks by geometric renormalization
021       Multiple scales coexist in complex networks. 
020       However, the small world property makes them strongly entangled. This turns the elucidation of length scales and symmetries a defiant challenge. Here, we define a geometric renormalization group for complex networks and use the technique to investigate networks as viewed at different scales. We find that real networks embedded in a hidden metric space show geometric scaling, in agreement with the renormalizability of the underlying geometric model. This allows us to unfold real scale-free networks in a self-similar multilayer shell which unveils the coexisting scales and their interplay. The multiscale unfolding offers a basis for a new approach to explore critical phenomena and universality in complex networks, and affords us immediate practical applications, like high-fidelity smaller-scale replicas of large networks and a multiscale navigation protocol in hyperbolic space which boosts the success of single-layer versions.

010       Universal mean-field framework for SIS epidemics on networks, based on   graph partitioning and the isoperimetric inequality
021       We propose a new approximation framework that unifies and generalizes a number of existing mean-field approximation methods for the SIS epidemic model on complex networks. 
020       We derive the framework, which we call the Universal Mean-Field Framework (UMFF), as a set of approximations of the exact Markovian SIS equations. Our main novelty is that we describe the mean-field approximations from the perspective of the isoperimetric problem, an insight which results in bounds on the UMFF approximation error. These new bounds provide insight in the accuracy of existing mean-field methods, such as the widely-used N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA) and Heterogeneous Mean-Field method (HMF). Additionally, the geometric perspective of the isoperimetric problem enables the UMFF approximation accuracy to be related to the regularity notions of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma, which yields a prediction about the behavior of the SIS process on large graphs.

010       Selfish Network Creation with Non-Uniform Edge Cost
021       Network creation games investigate complex networks from a game-theoretic point of view. 
020       Based on the original model by Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03] many variants have been introduced. However, almost all versions have the drawback that edges are treated uniformly, i.e. every edge has the same cost and that this common parameter heavily influences the outcomes and the analysis of these games. <br />We propose and analyze simple and natural parameter-free network creation games with non-uniform edge cost. Our models are inspired by social networks where the cost of forming a link is proportional to the popularity of the targeted node. Besides results on the complexity of computing a best response and on various properties of the sequential versions, we show that the most general version of our model has constant Price of Anarchy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of a constant Price of Anarchy for any network creation game.

010       Bio-inspired Evolutionary Game Dynamics on Complex Networks under   Uncertain Cross-inhibitory Signals
021       Given a large population of players, each player has three possible choices between option 1 or 2 or no option. 
020       The two options are equally favorable and the population has to reach consensus on one of the two options quickly and in a distributed way. The more popular an option is, the more likely it is to be chosen by uncommitted players. Uncommitted players can be attracted by those committed to any of the other two options through a cross-inhibitory signal. This model originates in the context of honeybees swarms, and we generalize it to duopolistic competition and opinion dynamics. The contributions of this work include (1) the formulation of an evolutionary game model to explain the behavioral traits of the honeybees, (2) the study of the individuals and collective behavior including equilibrium points and stability, (3) the extension of the results to the case of structured environment via complex network theory, (4) the analysis of the impact of the connectivity on consensus, and (5) the study of absolute stability for the collective system under time-varying and uncertain cross-inhibitory parameter.

010       Credit card fraud detection through parenclitic network analysis
021       The detection of frauds in credit card transactions is a major topic in financial research, of profound economic implications. 
020       While this has hitherto been tackled through data analysis techniques, the resemblances between this and other problems, like the design of recommendation systems and of diagnostic / prognostic medical tools, suggest that a complex network approach may yield important benefits. In this contribution we present a first hybrid data mining / complex network classification algorithm, able to detect illegal instances in a real card transaction data set. It is based on a recently proposed network reconstruction algorithm that allows creating representations of the deviation of one instance from a reference group. We show how the inclusion of features extracted from the network data representation improves the score obtained by a standard, neural network-based classification algorithm; and additionally how this combined approach can outperform a commercial fraud detection system in specific operation niches. Beyond these specific results, this contribution represents a new example on how complex networks and data mining can be integrated as complementary tools, with the former providing a view to data beyond the capabilities of the latter.

010       Cover time for random walks on arbitrary complex networks
021       We present an analytical method for computing the mean cover time of a random walk process on arbitrary, complex networks. 
020       The cover time is defined as the time a random walker requires to visit every node in the network at least once. This quantity is particularly important for random search processes and target localization in network topologies. Based on the global mean first passage time of target nodes we derive an estimate for the cumulative distribution function of the cover time based on first passage time statistics. We show that our result can be applied to various model networks, including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks, as well as various real-world networks. Our results reveal an intimate link between first passage and cover time statistics in networks in which structurally induced temporal correlations decay quickly and offer a computationally efficient way for estimating cover times in network related applications.

010       Network Dimensions in the Getty Provenance Index
021       In this article we make a case for a systematic application of complex network science to study art market history and more general collection dynamics. 
020       We reveal social, temporal, spatial, and conceptual network dimensions, i.e. network node and link types, previously implicit in the Getty Provenance Index (GPI). As a pioneering art history database active since the 1980s, the GPI provides online access to source material relevant for research in the history of collecting and art markets. Based on a subset of the GPI, we characterize an aggregate of more than 267,000 sales transactions connected to roughly 22,000 actors in four countries over 20 years at daily resolution from 1801 to 1820. Striving towards a deeper understanding on multiple levels we disambiguate social dynamics of buying, brokering, and selling, while observing a general broadening of the market, where large collections are split into smaller lots. Temporally, we find annual market cycles that are shifted by country and obviously favor international exchange. Spatially, we differentiate near-monopolies from regions driven by competing sub-centers, while uncovering asymmetries of international market flux. Conceptually, we track dynamics of artist attribution that clearly behave like product categories in a very slow supermarket. Taken together, we introduce a number of meaningful network perspectives dealing with historical art auction data, beyond the analysis of social networks within a single market region. The results presented here have inspired a Linked Open Data conversion of the GPI, which is currently in process and will allow further analysis by a broad set of researchers.

010       Crucial events, randomness and multi-fractality in heartbeats
021       We study the connection between multi-fractality and crucial events. 
020       Multi-fractality is frequently used as a measure of physiological variability. Crucial events are known to play a fundamental role in the transport of information between complex networks. To establish a connection we focus on the special case of heartbeat time series and on the search for a diagnostic prescription to distinguish healthy from pathologic subjects. Over the last twenty years two apparently different diagnostic techniques have been established: the first is based on the observation that the multi-fractal spectrum of healthy patients is broader than the multi-fractal spectrum of pathologic subjects; the second is based on the observation that heartbeat dynamics are a superposition of crucial and Poisson events, with pathologic patients hosting Poisson events with larger probability than the healthy patients. In this paper, we prove that increasing the percentage of Poisson events hosted by heartbeats has the effect of making their multi-fractal spectrum narrower, thereby establishing that the two different diagnostic techniques are compatible with one another and, at the same time, establishing a dynamic interpretation of multi-fractal processes that has been previously overlooked.

010       Decline of long-range temporal correlations in the human brain during   sustained wakefulness
021       Sleep is crucial for daytime functioning, cognitive performance and general well-being. 
020       These aspects of daily life are known to be impaired after extended wake, yet, the underlying neuronal correlates have been difficult to identify. Accumulating evidence suggests that normal functioning of the brain is characterized by long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in cortex, which are supportive for decision-making and working memory tasks. <br />Here we assess LRTCs in resting state human EEG data during a 40-hour sleep deprivation experiment by evaluating the decay in autocorrelation and the scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis from EEG amplitude fluctuations. We find with both measures that LRTCs decline as sleep deprivation progresses. This decline becomes evident when taking changes in signal power into appropriate consideration. <br />Our results demonstrate the importance of sleep to maintain LRTCs in the human brain. In complex networks, LRTCs naturally emerge in the vicinity of a critical state. The observation of declining LRTCs during wake thus provides additional support for our hypothesis that sleep reorganizes cortical networks towards critical dynamics for optimal functioning.

010       Recommending links through influence maximization
021       The link recommendation problem consists in suggesting a set of links to the users of a social network in order to increase their social circles and the connectivity of the network. 
020       Link recommendation is extensively studied in the context of social networks and of general complex networks due to its wide range of applications. Most of the existing link recommendation methods estimate the likelihood that a link is adopted by users and recommend links that are likely to be established. However, most of such methods overlook the impact that the suggested links have on the capability of the network to spread information. Indeed, such capability is directly correlated with both the engagement of a single user and the revenue of online social networks. In this paper, we study link recommendation systems from the point of view of information diffusion. In detail, we consider the problem in which we are allowed to spend a given budget to create new links so to suggest a bounded number of possible persons to whom become friend in order to maximize the influence of a given set of nodes. We model the influence diffusion in a network with the popular Independent Cascade model.

010       Dynamical and Topological Aspects of Consensus Formation in Complex   Networks
021       The present work analyses a particular scenario of consensus formation, where the individuals navigate across an underlying network defining the topology of the walks. 
020       The consensus, associated to a given opinion coded as a simple messages, is generated by interactions during the agent's walk and manifest itself in the collapse of the various opinions into a single one. We analyze how the topology of the underlying networks and the rules of interaction between the agents promote or inhibit the emergence of this consensus. We find that non-linear interaction rules are required to form consensus and that consensus is more easily achieved in networks whose degree distribution is narrower.

010       Deep Generative Models for Relational Data with Side Information
021       We present a probabilistic framework for overlapping community discovery and link prediction for relational data, given as a graph. 
020       The proposed framework has: (1) a deep architecture which enables us to infer multiple layers of latent features/communities for each node, providing superior link prediction performance on more complex networks and better interpretability of the latent features; and (2) a regression model which allows directly conditioning the node latent features on the side information available in form of node attributes. Our framework handles both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks with count-valued edges. We compare with various state-of-the-art methods and report results, both quantitative and qualitative, on several benchmark data sets.

010       Local Feature Descriptor Learning with Adaptive Siamese Network
021       Although the recent progress in the deep neural network has led to the development of learnable local feature descriptors, there is no explicit answer for estimation of the necessary size of a neural network. 
020       Specifically, the local feature is represented in a low dimensional space, so the neural network should have more compact structure. The small networks required for local feature descriptor learning may be sensitive to initial conditions and learning parameters and more likely to become trapped in local minima. In order to address the above problem, we introduce an adaptive pruning Siamese Architecture based on neuron activation to learn local feature descriptors, making the network more computationally efficient with an improved recognition rate over more complex networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our learned local feature descriptors outperform the state-of-art methods in patch matching.

010       Transfer entropy between communities in complex networks
021       With the help of transfer entropy, we analyze information flows between communities of complex networks. 
020       We show that the transfer entropy provides a coherent description of interactions between communities, including non-linear interactions. To put some flesh on the bare bones, we analyze transfer entropies between communities of five largest financial markets, represented as networks of interacting stocks. Additionally, we discuss information transfer of rare events, which is analyzed by R\'enyi transfer entropy.

010       Preferential placement for community structure formation
021       Various models have been recently proposed to reflect and predict different properties of complex networks. 
020       However, the community structure, which is one of the most important properties, is not well studied and modeled. In this paper, we suggest a principle called "preferential placement", which allows to model a realistic community structure. We provide an extensive empirical analysis of the obtained structure as well as some theoretical results.

010       Unifying ageing and frailty through complex dynamical networks
021       To explore the mechanistic relationships between ageing, frailty and mortality, we developed a computational model in which possible health attributes are represented by the nodes of a complex network. 
020       Each node can be either damaged (i.e. a deficit) or undamaged. Damage of connected nodes facilitates further local damage. Our model recovers the known patterns of frailty and mortality without any programmed ageing. It helps us to understand how the observed maximum of the frailty index (FI) might arise, and allows us to start to understand how health deficits accumulate. Large model populations allow us to exploit new analytic tools, including information theory. This will allow us to systematically characterize the effects of sudden changes in the health trajectories of individuals and serve as a way to evaluate large clinical and population databases.

010       Selecting nodes and buying links to maximize the information diffusion   in a network
021       The Independent Cascade Model (ICM) is a widely studied model that aims to capture the dynamics of the information diffusion in social networks and in general complex networks. 
020       In this model, we can distinguish between active nodes which spread the information and inactive ones. The process starts from a set of initially active nodes called seeds. Recursively, currently active nodes can activate their neighbours according to a probability distribution on the set of edges. After a certain number of these recursive cycles, a large number of nodes might become active. The process terminates when no further node gets activated. Starting from the work of Domingos and Richardson, several studies have been conducted with the aim of shaping a given diffusion process so as to maximize the number of activated nodes at the end of the process. One of the most studied problems has been formalized by Kempe et al. and consists in finding a set of initial seeds that maximizes the expected number of active nodes under a budget constraint. In this paper we study a generalization of the problem of Kempe et al. in which we are allowed to spend part of the budget to create new edges incident to the seeds. That is, the budget can be spent to buy seeds or edges according to a cost function. The problem does not admin a PTAS, unless $P=NP$. We propose two approximation algorithms: the former one gives an approximation ratio that depends on the edge costs and increases when these costs are high; the latter algorithm gives a constant approximation guarantee which is greater than that of the first algorithm when the edge costs can be small.

010       The Rise and Fall of Network Stars: Analyzing 2.5 million graphs to   reveal how high-degree vertices emerge over time
021       Trends change rapidly in today's world, prompting this key question: What is the mechanism behind the emergence of new trends? By representing real-world dynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be symbolized by vertices that "shine." That is, at a specific time interval in a network's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other vertices. 
020       This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars. Thus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and determine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest publicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000 real-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first precise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales. Three primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among vertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices join a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the emergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with fast-growing networks. We applied our learnings to develop a flexible network-generation model based on large-scale, real-world data. This model gives a better understanding of how stars rise and fall within networks, and is applicable to dynamic systems both in nature and society.

010       Equilibria, information and frustration in heterogeneous network games   with conflicting preferences
021       Interactions between people are the basis on which the structure of our society arises as a complex system and, at the same time, are the starting point of any physical description of it. 
020       In the last few years, much theoretical research has addressed this issue by combining the physics of complex networks with a description of interactions in terms of evolutionary game theory. We here take this research a step further by introducing a most salient societal factor such as the individuals' preferences, a characteristic that is key to understand much of the social phenomenology these days. We consider a heterogeneous, agent-based model in which agents interact strategically with their neighbors but their preferences and payoffs for the possible actions differ. We study how such a heterogeneous network behaves under evolutionary dynamics and different strategic interactions, namely coordination games and best shot games. With this model we study the emergence of the equilibria predicted analytically in random graphs under best response dynamics, and we extend this test to unexplored contexts like proportional imitation and scale free networks. We show that some theoretically predicted equilibria do not arise in simulations with incomplete Information, and we demonstrate the importance of the graph topology and the payoff function parameters for some games. Finally, we discuss our results with available experimental evidence on coordination games, showing that our model agrees better with the experiment that standard economic theories, and draw hints as to how to maximize social efficiency in situations of conflicting preferences.

021       In this paper, we consider the problem of assessing local clustering in complex networks. 
020       Various definitions for this measure have been proposed for the cases of networks having weighted edges, but less attention has been paid to both weighted and directed networks. We provide a new local clustering coefficient for this kind of networks, starting from those existing in the literature for the weighted and undirected case. Furthermore, we extract from our coefficient four specific components, in order to separately consider different link patterns of triangles. Empirical applications on several real networks from different frameworks and with different order are provided. The performance of our coefficient is also compared with that of existing coefficients in the literature.

010       Partial inertia induces additional phase transition in the explosive   majority vote model
021       Recently it has been aroused a great interest about explosive (i.e., discontinuous) transitions. 
020       They manifest in distinct systems, such as synchronization in coupled oscillators, percolation regime, absorbing phase transitions and more recently, in the majority-vote (MV) model with inertia. In the latter, the model rules are slightly modified by the inclusion of a term depending on the local spin (an inertial term). In such case, Chen et al. (Phys Rev. E {5}, 042304 (2017)) have found that relevant inertia changes the nature of the phase transition in complex networks, from continuous to discontinuous. Here we give a further step by embedding inertia only in vertices with degree larger than a threshold value $\langle k \rangle k^*$, $\langle k \rangle$ being the mean system degree and $k^*$ the fraction restriction. Our results, from mean-field analysis and extensive numerical simulations, reveal that an explosive transition is presented in both homogeneous and heterogeneous structures for small and intermediate $k^*$'s. Otherwise, large restriction can sustain a discontinuous transition only in the heterogeneous case. This shares some similarity with recent results for the Kuramoto model (Phys Rev. E {91}, 022818 (2015)). Surprisingly, intermediate restriction and large inertia are responsible for the emergence of an extra phase, in which the system is partially synchronized and the classification of phase transition depends on the inertia and the lattice topology. In this case, the system exhibits two phase transitions.

010       Development of structural correlations and synchronization from adaptive   rewiring in networks of Kuramoto oscillators
021       Synchronization of non-identical oscillators coupled through complex networks is an important example of collective behavior. 
020       It is interesting to ask how the structural organization of network interactions influences this process. Several studies have uncovered optimal topologies for synchronization by making purposeful alterations to a network. Yet, the connectivity patterns of many natural systems are often not static, but are rather modulated over time according to their dynamics. This co-evolution - and the extent to which the dynamics of the individual units can shape the organization of the network itself - is not well understood. Here, we study initially randomly connected but locally adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators. The system employs a co-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on instantaneous, pairwise phase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total number of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated. We find that a simple regulatory rule - which preserves connections between more out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase oscillators - can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more structured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We examine how this process unfolds over time, finding both a dependence on the intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators and the global coupling. For large enough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit degree - frequency and frequency - neighbor frequency correlations. These properties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or explosive transitions. By considering a time-dependent interplay between structure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent phenomena can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.

010       A simple method for shifting local dq impedance models to a global   reference frame for stability analysis
021       Impedance-based stability analysis in the dq-domain is a widely applied method for power electronic dominated systems. 
020       An inconvenient property with this method is that impedance models are normally referred to their own local reference frame, and need to be recalculated when referring to a global reference frame in a given network. This letter presents a simple method for translating impedance sub-models within a complex network, from their own reference frames to any given point in the network. What distinguishes this method is that by using a simple rotational matrix, it only needs impedance models in their own local reference frames, to be translated to a global reference in the network. By way of this method, standard circuit analysis rules for series and parallel connection are applicable, as proven in the letter. The method is defined and validated for impedances in the dq and modified sequence domains, and it is shown that the dependency on reference frame is marginal in the latter. An additional finding from the application of this method is that components or subsystems with a certain symmetry property called Mirror Frequency Decoupling are invariant to the choice of reference frame.

010       Words as block of notes and Zipf law in music using visibility algorithm
021       In this work we were aimed to study music using visibility algorithms. 
020       This algorithms are used as a way to get a network, from a time series. However the main idea of this paper was not to study music from the perspective of complex networks, but to studying it as a lenguage, basically the changes in wath we call \textit{words,} between diferents ages in music. The visibility algorithm provide us a way to cut time series and generate the words, of the composers we where studying. We study clasical music composers from differents ages, from Bach to Schostakovish. Time series in this work came from MIDI archives and the series were generated by, the absolute diference between two adyacent notes, in the first voice in the MIDI archive. Once we had our series we apply the algorithm to generate words. The visibility algorihm was used also, as a way to get Zipf law becouse at first what we found was that when we used visibility algorithm we create a free-scale network, so we decided to take subgroup of this network that is going to be also free of scale, and make the musical words.

010       Curvature-based Methods for Brain Network Analysis
021       The human brain forms functional networks on all spatial scales. 
020       Modern fMRI scanners allow for resolving functional brain data in high resolution, enabling the study of large-scale networks that relate to cognitive processes. The analysis of such networks forms a cornerstone of experimental neuroscience. Due to the immense size and complexity of the underlying data sets, efficient evaluation and visualization pose challenges for data analysis. In this study, we combine recent advances in experimental neuroscience and applied mathematics to perform a mathematical characterization of complex networks constructed from fMRI data. We use task-related edge densities [Lohmann et al., 2016] for constructing networks whose nodes represent voxels in the fMRI data and whose edges represent the task-related changes in synchronization between them. This construction captures the dynamic formation of patterns of neuronal activity and therefore efficiently represents the connectivity structure between brain regions. Using geometric methods that utilize Forman-Ricci curvature as an edge-based network characteristic [Weber et al., 2017], we perform a mathematical analysis of the resulting complex networks. We motivate the use of edge-based characteristics to evaluate the network structure with geometric methods. Our results identify important structural network features including long-range connections of high curvature acting as bridges between major network components. The geometric features link curvature to higher order network organization that could aid in understanding the connectivity and interplay of brain regions in cognitive processes.

Here we build a large deviation theory of percolation characterizing the response of a sparse network to rare events. This general theory includes the second order phase transition observed typically for random configurations of the initial damage but reveals also discontinuous transitions corresponding to rare configurations of the initial damage for which the size of the giant component is suppressed.

010       Research on Centralities Based on von Neumann Entropy for Nodes and   Motifs
021       When analyzing the statistical and topological characteristics of complex networks, an effective and convenient way is to compute the centralities for recognizing influential and significant nodes or structures. 
020       Centralities for nodes are widely researched to depict the networks from a certain perspective and perform great efficiency, yet most of them are restricted to local environment or some specific configurations and hard to be generalized to structural patterns of networks. In this paper we propose a new centrality for nodes and motifs by the von Neumann entropy, which allows us to investigate the importance of nodes or structural patterns in the view of structural complexity. By calculating and comparing similarities of this centrality with classical ones, it is shown that the von Neumann entropy node centrality is an all-round index for selecting crucial nodes, and able to evaluate and summarize the performance of other centralities. Furthermore, when the analysis is generalized to motifs to achieve the von Neumann entropy motif centrality, the all-round property is kept, the structural information is sufficiently reflected by integrating the nodes and connections, and the high-centrality motifs found by this mechanism perform greater impact on the networks than high-centrality single nodes found by classical node centralities. This new methodology reveals the influence of various structural patterns on the regularity and complexity of networks, which provides us a fresh perspective to study networks and performs great potentials to discover essential structural features in networks.

010       Data Fusion Reconstruction of Spatially Embedded Complex Networks

020       Through a kernel function, the proposed approach exploits spatial embedding distances to penalize overabundance of spatially long-distance connections. Examples of both synthetic and real-world spatial networks show that the proposed method improves significantly upon existing network reconstruction techniques that mainly concerns sparsity but not spatial regularity. Our results highlight the promise of data fusion in the reconstruction of complex networks, by utilizing both microscopic node-level dynamics (e.g., time series data) and macroscopic network-level information (metadata).

010       Cycle-centrality in complex networks
021       Networks are versatile representations of the interactions between entities in complex systems. 
020       Cycles on such networks represent feedback processes which play a central role in system dynamics. In this work, we introduce a measure of the importance of any individual cycle, as the fraction of the total information flow of the network passing through the cycle. This measure is computationally cheap, numerically well-conditioned, induces a centrality measure on arbitrary subgraphs and reduces to the eigenvector centrality on vertices. We demonstrate that this measure accurately reflects the impact of events on strategic ensembles of economic sectors, notably in the US economy. As a second example, we show that in the protein-interaction network of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a model based on cycle-centrality better accounts for pathogen activity than the state-of-art one. This translates into pathogen-targeted-proteins being concentrated in a small number of triads with high cycle-centrality. Algorithms for computing the centrality of cycles and subgraphs are available for download.

010       Properties of a Projected Network of a Bipartite Network
021       Bipartite Graph is often a realistic model of complex networks where two different sets of entities are involved and relationship exist only two entities belonging to two different sets. 
020       Examples include the user-item relationship of a recommender system, actor-movie relationship of an online movie database systems. One way to compress a bipartite graph is to take unweighted or weighted one mode projection of one side vertices. Properties of this projected network are extremely important in many practical situations (say the selection process of influencing nodes for viral marketing). In this paper, we have studied the topological properties for projected network and some theoretical results are proved including the presence of cliques, connectedness for unweighted projection and maximum edge weight for weighted projected network.

010       Network analysis of the COSMOS galaxy field
021       The complex network analysis of COSMOS galaxy field for R.A. 
020       = 149.4 deg - 150.4 deg and Decl. = 1.7 deg - 2.7 deg is presented. 2D projections of spatial distributions of galaxies in three redshift slices 0.88-0.91, 0.91-0.94 and 0.94-0.97 are studied. We analyse network similarity/peculiarity of different samples and correlations of galaxy astrophysical properties (colour index and stellar mass) with their topological environments. For each slice the local and global network measures are calculated. Results indicate a high level of similarity between geometry and topology of different galaxy samples. We found no clear evidence of evolutionary change in network measures for different slices. Most local network measures have non-Gaussian distributions, often bi- or multi-modal. The distribution of local clustering coefficient C manifests three modes which allow for discrimination between stand-alone singlets and dumbbells (0 &lt;= C &lt; 0.1), intermediately packed galaxies (0.1 &lt;= C &lt; 0.9) and cliques (0.9 &lt;= C &lt;= 1). Analysing astrophysical properties, we show that mean values and distributions of galaxy colour index and stellar mass are similar in all slices. However, statistically significant correlations are found if one selects galaxies according to different modes of C distribution. The distribution of stellar mass for galaxies with interim C differ from the corresponding distributions for stand-alone and clique galaxies. This difference holds for all redshift slices. Besides, the analogous difference in the colour index distributions is observed only in the central redshift interval.

010       Theories for influencer identification in complex networks
021       In social and biological systems, the structural heterogeneity of interaction networks gives rise to the emergence of a small set of influential nodes, or influencers, in a series of dynamical processes. 
020       Although much smaller than the entire network, these influencers were observed to be able to shape the collective dynamics of large populations in different contexts. As such, the successful identification of influencers should have profound implications in various real-world spreading dynamics such as viral marketing, epidemic outbreaks and cascading failure. In this chapter, we first summarize the centrality-based approach in finding single influencers in complex networks, and then discuss the more complicated problem of locating multiple influencers from a collective point of view. Progress rooted in collective influence theory, belief-propagation and computer science will be presented. Finally, we present some applications of influencer identification in diverse real-world systems, including online social platforms, scientific publication, brain networks and socioeconomic systems.

010       Fast Heuristic Algorithm for Multi-scale Hierarchical Community   Detection
021       Complex networks constitute the backbones of many complex systems such as social networks. 
020       Detecting the community structure in a complex network is both a challenging and a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we present the HAMUHI-CODE, a novel fast heuristic algorithm for multi-scale hierarchical community detection inspired on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique. We define a new structural similarity of vertices based on the classical cosine similarity by removing some vertices in order to increase the probability of identifying inter-cluster edges. Then we use the proposed structural similarity in a new agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that does not merge only clusters with maximal similarity as in the classical approach, but merges any cluster that does not meet a parameterized community definition with its most similar adjacent cluster. The algorithm computes all the similar clusters at the same time is checking if each cluster meets the parameterized community definition. It is done in linear time complexity in terms of the number of cluster in the iteration. Since a complex network is a sparse graph, our approach HAMUHI-CODE has a super-linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input in the worst-case scenario (if the clusters merge in pairs), making it suitable to be applied on large-scale complex networks. To test the properties and the efficiency of our algorithm we have conducted extensive experiments on real world and synthetic benchmark networks by comparing it to several baseline state-of-the-art algorithms.

010       Complex Network for Solar Active Regions
021       Here, we developed a complex network of solar active regions (ARs) to study various local and global properties of the network. 
020       The values of the Hurst exponent ($0.8-0.9$) were evaluated by both the detrended fluctuation analysis and the rescaled range analysis applied on the time series of the AR numbers. The findings suggest that ARs can be considered as a system of self-organized criticality. We constructed a growing network based on locations, occurrence times, and the lifetimes of 4,227 ARs recorded from 1 January 1999 to 14 April 2017. The behaviour of the clustering coefficient shows that the ARs network is not a random network. The logarithmic behaviour of the length scale has the characteristics of a so-called \textquotedblleft small-world network\textquotedblright. It is found that the probability distribution of the node degrees for undirected networks follows the power-law with exponents of about 3.7 to 4.2. This indicates the scale-free nature of the ARs network. The scale-free and small-world properties of the ARs network confirm that the system of ARs forms a system of self-organized criticality. Our results show that the occurrence probability of flares (classified by GOES class C $&gt; 5$, M, and X flares) in the position of the ARs network hubs take values greater than that obtained for other nodes.

010       Detection of AQM on Paths using Machine Learning Methods

020       We assume that we are given a source-to-sink path of interest -along which a bottleneck router exists- and data regarding the Round-Trip Times (RTT) and Congestion Window (CWND) sizes with respect to this flow. We develop a reliable classification algorithm that solely uses RTT and CWND information pertaining to a single flow to classify the queuing scheme, Tail Drop or AQM, used by the bottleneck router. We evaluate our method and present results that demonstrate our algorithm's highly accurate classification ability across a wide array of complex network topologies and configurations.

010       Tailoring Artificial Neural Networks for Optimal Learning
021       As one of the most important paradigms of recurrent neural networks, the echo state network (ESN) has been applied to a wide range of fields, from robotics to medicine to finance, and language processing. 
020       A key feature of the ESN paradigm is its reservoir ---a directed and weighted network--- that represents the connections between neurons and projects the input signals into a high dimensional space. Despite extensive studies, the impact of the reservoir network on the ESN performance remains unclear. Here we systematically address this fundamental question. Through spectral analysis of the reservoir network we reveal a key factor that largely determines the ESN memory capacity and hence affects its performance. Moreover, we find that adding short loops to the reservoir network can tailor ESN for specific tasks and optimal learning. We validate our findings by applying ESN to forecast both synthetic and real benchmark time series. Our results provide a new way to design task-specific recurrent neural networks, as well as new insights in understanding complex networked systems.

010       PageRank on inhomogeneous random digraphs
021       We study the typical behavior of a generalized version of Google's PageRank algorithm on a large family of inhomogeneous random digraphs. 
020       This family includes as special cases directed versions of classical models such as the Erd\"os-R\'enyi model, the Chung-Lu model, the Poissonian random graph and the generalized random graph, and is suitable for modeling scale-free directed complex networks where the number of neighbors a vertex has is related to its attributes. In particular, we show that the rank of a randomly chosen node in a graph from this family converges weakly to the attracting endogenous solution to the stochastic fixed-point equation $$\mathcal{R} \stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=} \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{N}} \mathcal{C}_i \mathcal{R}_i + \mathcal{Q},$$ where $(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{Q}, \{\mathcal{C}_i\}_{i \geq 1})$ is a real-valued vector with $\mathcal{N}\in \{0,1,2,...\}$, the $\{ \mathcal{R}_i\}$ are i.i.d.~copies of $\mathcal{R}$, independent of $(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{Q}, \{\mathcal{C}_i\}_{i \geq 1})$, with $\{ \mathcal{C}_i\}$ i.i.d.~and independent of $(\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{Q})$; $\stackrel{\mathcal{D}}{=}$ denotes equality in distribution. This result can then be used to provide further evidence of the power-law behavior of PageRank on scale-free graphs.

010       802.11 Wireless Access Point Usage Simulation and Anomaly Detection
021       Despite the growing popularity of 802.11 wireless networks in many public places, wireless users often suffer from connectivity problems due to unstable radio conditions and dynamic user behavior among other reasons. 
020       Detecting the anomalous cases and planning to prevent such problems in advance are in the thick of major challenges that network managers encounter. Complication of monitoring such complex networks, that often requires heavy instrumentation of the user devices, makes the anomaly detection analysis even harder. In this paper we exploit 802.11 access point usage data and propose an anomaly detection technique based on Hidden Markov Models and on data that is inexpensive to obtain. We subsequently validate the proposed model by generating a number of network anomalous scenarios in OMNeT++/INET network simulator and evaluate the detection method against baseline approach (Raw_Data and PCA) results. The experimental outcomes show the superiority of the proposed HMM model in detection precision and sensitivity.

010       Community Discovery in Dynamic Networks: a Survey
021       Networks built to model real world phenomena are characeterised by some properties that have attracted the attention of the scientific community: (i) they are organised according to community structure and (ii) their structure evolves with time. 
020       Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and challenging problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. To model the evolution of a system, dynamic networks can be used: nodes and edges are mutable and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them. The aim of this survey is to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery, and propose a classification of published approaches. As a "user manual", this work organizes state of art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instanciation. Given a desired definition of network dynamics, community characteristics and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs. The proposed classification could also help researchers to choose in which direction should future research be oriented.

010       Optimal coupling patterns in interconnected communication networks
021       Traffic dynamics on single or isolated complex networks has been extensively studied in the past decade. 
020       Recently, several coupled network models have been developed to describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In a system of interconnected networks, the coupling links refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. Thus, the coupling pattern, i.e., the way coupling links are added, has a profound influence on the overall traffic performance. In this paper, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the coupling links, which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration of coupling links given by the SA algorithm and develop a faster method to select the coupling links.

We show that the deterministic or stochastic nature of the computer algorithm playing the game can also be distinguished from these quantities. This can be seen as tool to implement a Turing-like test for go simulators.

010       Rewiring hierarchical scale-free networks: Influence on   synchronizability and topology
021       Many real-world complex networks simultaneously exhibit topological features of scale-free behaviour and hierarchical organization. 
020       In this regard, deterministic scale-free [A.-L. Barab\'asi \etal, Physica A, 299, 3 (2001)] and pseudofractal scale-free [S. N. Dorogovtsev \etal, Phy. Rev. E, 65, 6 (2002)] networks constitute notable models which simultaneously incorporate the aforementioned properties. The rules governing the formation of such networks are completely deterministic. However, real-world networks are presumably neither completely deterministic, nor perfectly hierarchical. Therefore, we suggest here perfectly hierarchical scale-free networks with randomly rewired edges as better representatives of practical networked systems. In particular, we preserve the scale-free degree distribution of the various deterministic networks but successively relax the hierarchical structure while rewiring them. We utilize the framework of master stability function in investigating the synchronizability of dynamical systems coupled on such rewired networks. Interestingly, this reveals that the process of rewiring is capable of significantly enhancing, as well as, deteriorating the synchronizability of the resulting networks. We investigate the influence of rewiring edges on the topological properties of the rewired networks and, in turn, their relation to the synchronizability of the respective topologies. Finally, we compare the synchronizability of deterministic scale-free and pseudofractcal scale-free networks with that of random scale-free networks (generated using the classical Barab\'asi-Albert model of growth and preferential attachment) and find that the latter ones promote synchronizability better than their deterministic counterparts.

010       Performance bounds for optimal feedback control in networks
021       Many important complex networks, including critical infrastructure and emerging industrial automation systems, are becoming increasingly intricate webs of interacting feedback control loops. 
020       A fundamental concern is to quantify the control properties and performance limitations of the network as a function of its dynamical structure and control architecture. We study performance bounds for networks in terms of optimal feedback control costs. We provide a set of complementary bounds as a function of the system dynamics and actuator structure. For unstable network dynamics, we characterize a tradeoff between feedback control performance and the number of control inputs, in particular showing that optimal cost can increase exponentially with the size of the network. We also derive a bound on the performance of the worst-case actuator subset for stable networks, providing insight into dynamics properties that affect the potential efficacy of actuator selection. We illustrate our results with numerical experiments that analyze performance in regular and random networks.

010       Exploring the Role of Intrinsic Nodal Activation on the Spread of   Influence in Complex Networks
021       In many complex networked systems, such as online social networks, activity originates at certain nodes and subsequently spreads on the network through influence. 
020       In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the spread of influence and the identification of influential entities in a complex network when nodal activation can happen via two different mechanisms. The first mechanism of activation stems from factors that are intrinsic to the node. The second mechanism comes from the influence of connected neighbors. After introducing the model, we provide an algorithm to mine for the influential nodes in such a scenario by modifying the well-known influence maximization algorithm to work with our model that incorporates both forms of activation. Our model can be considered as a variation of the independent cascade diffusion model. We provide small motivating examples to facilitate an intuitive understanding of the effect of including the intrinsic activation mechanism. We sketch a proof of the submodularity of the influence function under the new formulation and demonstrate the same on larger graphs. Based on the model, we explain how influential content creators can drive engagement on social media platforms. Using additional experiments on a Twitter dataset, we then show how the formulation can be applied to real-world social media datasets. Finally, we derive a centrality metric that takes into account, both the mechanisms of activation and provides for an accurate, computationally efficient, alternate approach to the problem of identifying influencers under intrinsic activation.

010       On the Dynamical Foundation of Multifractality
021       The crucial aspect of this demonstration is the discovery of renewal events, hidden in the computed dynamics of a multifractal metronome, which enables the replacement of the phenomenon of strong anticipation with a time delayed cross-correlation between the driven and the driving metronome. 
020       We establish that the phenomenon of complexity matching, which is the theme of an increasing number of research groups, has two distinct measures. One measure is the sensitivity of a complex system to environmental multi-fractality; another is the level of information transfer, between two complex networks at criticality. The cross-correlation function is evaluated in the ergodic long-time limit, but its delayed maximal value is the signature of information transfer occurring in the non ergodic short-time regime. It is shown that a more complex system transfers its multifractality to a less complex system while the reverse case is not possible.

010       Large order fluctuations, switching, and control in complex networks
021       We propose an analytical technique to study large fluctuations and switching from internal noise in complex networks. 
020       Using order-disorder kinetics as a generic example, we construct and analyze the most probable, or optimal path of fluctuations from one ordered state to another in real and synthetic networks. The method allows us to compute the distribution of large fluctuations and the time scale associated with switching between ordered states for networks consistent with mean-field assumptions. In general, we quantify how network heterogeneity influences the scaling patterns and probabilities of fluctuations. For instance, we find that the probability of a large fluctuation near an order-disorder transition decreases exponentially with the participation ratio of a network's principle eigenvector -- measuring how many nodes effectively contribute to an ordered state. Finally, the proposed theory is used to answer how and where a network should be targeted in order to optimize the time needed to observe a switch.

010       Transition to synchrony in degree-frequency correlated   Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model
021       We investigate transition to synchrony in degree-frequency correlated Sakaguchi-Kuramoto (SK) model on complex networks both analytically and numerically. 
020       We analytically derive self-consistent equations for group angular velocity and order parameter for the model in the thermodynamic limit. Using the self-consistent equations we investigate transition to synchronization in SK model on uncorrelated scale-free (SF) and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi (ER) networks in detail. Depending on the degree distribution exponent ($\gamma$) of SF networks and phase-frustration parameter, the population undergoes from first order transition (explosive synchronization (ES)) to second order transition and vice versa. In ER networks transition is always second order irrespective of the phase-lag parameter. We observe that the critical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization is decreased by phase-frustration parameter in case of SF network where as in ER network, the phase-frustration delays the onset of synchronization. Extensive numerical simulations using SF and ER networks are performed to validate the analytical results. An analytical expression of critical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization is also derived from the self consistent equations considering the vanishing order parameter limit.

021       Catastrophic failures are complete and sudden collapses in the activity of large networks such as economics, electrical power grids and computer networks, which typically require a manual recovery process. 
020       Here we experimentally show that excitatory neural networks are governed by a non-Poissonian reoccurrence of catastrophic failures, where their repetition time follows a multimodal distribution characterized by a few tenths of a second and tens of seconds timescales. The mechanism underlying the termination and reappearance of network activity is quantitatively shown here to be associated with nodal time-dependent features, neuronal plasticity, where hyperactive nodes damage the response capability of their neighbors. It presents a complementary mechanism for the emergence of Poissonian catastrophic failures from damage conductivity. The effect that hyperactive nodes degenerate their neighbors represents a type of local competition which is a common feature in the dynamics of real-world complex networks, whereas their spontaneous recoveries represent a vitality which enhances reliable functionality.

010       Robust modeling of human contact networks across different scales and   proximity-sensing techniques
021       The problem of mapping human close-range proximity networks has been tackled using a variety of technical approaches. 
020       Wearable electronic devices, in particular, have proven to be particularly successful in a variety of settings relevant for research in social science, complex networks and infectious diseases dynamics. Each device and technology used for proximity sensing (e.g., RFIDs, Bluetooth, low-power radio or infrared communication, etc.) comes with specific biases on the close-range relations it records. Hence it is important to assess which statistical features of the empirical proximity networks are robust across different measurement techniques, and which modeling frameworks generalize well across empirical data. Here we compare time-resolved proximity networks recorded in different experimental settings and show that some important statistical features are robust across all settings considered. The observed universality calls for a simplified modeling approach. We show that one such simple model is indeed able to reproduce the main statistical distributions characterizing the empirical temporal networks.

010       Voltage Analytics for Power Distribution Network Topology Verification
021       Distribution grids constitute complex networks of lines often times reconfigured to minimize losses, balance loads, alleviate faults, or for maintenance purposes. 
020       Topology monitoring becomes a critical task for optimal grid scheduling. While synchrophasor installations are limited in low-voltage grids, utilities have an abundance of smart meter data at their disposal. In this context, a statistical learning framework is put forth for verifying single-phase grid structures using non-synchronized voltage data. The related maximum likelihood task boils down to minimizing a non-convex function over a non-convex set. The function involves the sample voltage covariance matrix and the feasible set is relaxed to its convex hull. Asymptotically in the number of data, the actual topology yields the global minimizer of the original and the relaxed problems. Under a simplified data model, the function turns out to be convex, thus offering optimality guarantees. Prior information on line statuses is also incorporated via a maximum a-posteriori approach. The formulated tasks are tackled using solvers having complementary strengths. Numerical tests using real data on benchmark feeders demonstrate that reliable topology estimates can be acquired even with a few smart meter data, while the non-convex schemes exhibit superior line verification performance at the expense of additional computational time.

010       A nonuniform popularity-similarity optimization (nPSO) model to   efficiently generate realistic complex networks with communities
021       The hidden metric space behind complex network topologies is a fervid topic in current network science and the hyperbolic space is one of the most studied, because it seems associated to the structural organization of many real complex systems. 
020       The Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model simulates how random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong clustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community organization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently developed to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have variable level of attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real applications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model that, differently from GPA, forces heterogeneous angular node attractiveness by sampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability distribution, for instance a mixture of Gaussians. The nPSO differs from GPA in other three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of communities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After several tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate networks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a realistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link prediction.

010       Information processing in biological molecular machines
021       Nanoscopic protein machines can store and manipulate information. 
020       We show that it happens if their intramolecular stochastic dynamics of conformational transitions enable performing the work in many randomly selected ways. A sample model of such dynamics, specified by a critical complex network, is investigated by computer simulations. For this model, the generalized fluctuation theorem is proven to be held with a possible entropy reduction at the expense of information creation. Information creation and storage takes place in the transient, nonergodic stages of dynamics before completing the free energy transduction cycle. From the biological perspective, the suppositions could be of especial importance that (1) a partial compensation of entropy production by information creation is the reason for most protein machines to operate as dimers or higher organized assemblies and (2) nonergodicity is essential for transcription factors in search for the target on DNA. From a broader physical perspective, it is worth emphasizing the guess that, similarly as work and heat are changes in energy, information could be considered as a change in fluctuating organization, which is also an adequately defined thermodynamic function of state.

010       Local-ring network automata and the impact of hyperbolic geometry in   complex network link-prediction
021       Topological link-prediction can exploit the entire network topology (global methods) or only the neighbourhood (local methods) of the link to predict. 
020       Global methods are believed the best. Is this common belief well-founded? Stochastic-Block-Model (SBM) is a global method believed as one of the best link-predictors, therefore it is considered a reference for comparison. But, our results suggest that SBM, whose computational time is high, cannot in general overcome the Cannistraci-Hebb (CH) network automaton model that is a simple local-learning-rule of topological self-organization proved as the current best local-based and parameter-free deterministic rule for link-prediction. To elucidate the reasons of this unexpected result, we formally introduce the notion of local-ring network automata models and their relation with the nature of common-neighbours' definition in complex network theory. After extensive tests, we recommend Structural-Perturbation-Method (SPM) as the new best global method baseline. However, even SPM overall does not outperform CH and in several evaluation frameworks we astonishingly found the opposite. In particular, CH was the best predictor for synthetic networks generated by the Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model, and its performance in PSO networks with community structure was even better than using the original internode-hyperbolic-distance as link-predictor. Interestingly, when tested on non-hyperbolic synthetic networks the performance of CH significantly dropped down indicating that this rule of network self-organization could be strongly associated to the rise of hyperbolic geometry in complex networks. The superiority of global methods seems a "misleading belief" caused by a latent geometry bias of the few small networks used as benchmark in previous studies. We propose to found a latent geometry theory of link-prediction in complex networks.

010       The diameter of KPKVB random graphs
021       We consider a model for complex networks that was recently proposed as a model for complex networks by Krioukov et al. 
020       In this model, nodes are chosen randomly inside a disk in the hyperbolic plane and two nodes are connected if they are at most a certain hyperbolic distance from each other. It has been previously shown that this model has various properties associated with complex networks, including a power-law degree distribution and a strictly positive clustering coefficient. The model is specified using three parameters : the number of nodes $N$, which we think of as going to infinity, and $\alpha, \nu &gt; 0$ which we think of as constant. Roughly speaking $\alpha$ controls the power law exponent of the degree sequence and $\nu$ the average degree. <br />Earlier work of Kiwi and Mitsche has shown that when $\alpha &lt; 1$ (which corresponds to the exponent of the power law degree sequence being $&lt; 3$) then the diameter of the largest component is a.a.s.~polylogarithmic in $N$. Friedrich and Krohmer have shown it is a.a.s.~$\Omega(\log N)$ and they improved the exponent of the polynomial in $\log N$ in the upper bound. Here we show the maximum diameter over all components is a.a.s.~$O(\log N)$ thus giving a bound that is tight up to a multiplicative constant.

010       Emerging Topics in Internet Technology: A Complex Networks Approach
021       Communication networks, in general, and internet technology, in particular, is a fast-evolving area of research. 
020       While it is important to keep track of emerging trends in this domain, it is such a fast-growing area that it can be very difficult to keep track of literature. The problem is compounded by the fast-growing number of citation databases. While other databases are gradually indexing a large set of reliable content, currently the Web of Science represents one of the most highly valued databases. Research indexed in this database is known to highlight key advancements in any domain. In this paper, we present a Complex Network-based analytical approach to analyze recent data from the Web of Science in communication networks. Taking bibliographic records from the recent period of 2014 to 2017, we model and analyze complex scientometric networks. Using bibliometric coupling applied over complex citation data we present answers to co-citation patterns of documents, co-occurrence patterns of terms, as well as the most influential articles, among others, We also present key pivot points and intellectual turning points. Complex network analysis of the data demonstrates a considerably high level of interest in two key clusters labeled descriptively as "social networks" and "computer networks". In addition, key themes in highly cited literature were clearly identified as "communication networks," "social networks," and "complex networks".

010       Network Community Detection: A Review and Visual Survey
021       Community structure is an important area of research. 
020       It has received a considerable attention from the scientific community. Despite its importance, one of the key problems in locating information about community detection is the diverse spread of related articles across various disciplines. To the best of our knowledge, there is no current comprehensive review of recent literature which uses a scientometric analysis using complex networks analysis covering all relevant articles from the Web of Science (WoS). Here we present a visual survey of key literature using CiteSpace. The idea is to identify emerging trends besides using network techniques to examine the evolution of the domain. Towards that end, we identify the most influential, central, as well as active nodes using scientometric analyses. We examine authors, key articles, cited references, core subject categories, key journals, institutions, as well as countries. The exploration of the scientometric literature of the domain reveals that Yong Wang is a pivot node with the highest centrality. Additionally, we have observed that Mark Newman is the most highly cited author in the network. We have also identified that the journal, "Reviews of Modern Physics" has the strongest citation burst. In terms of cited documents, an article by Andrea Lancichinetti has the highest centrality score. We have also discovered that the origin of the key publications in this domain is from the United States. Whereas Scotland has the strongest and longest citation burst. Additionally, we have found that the categories of "Computer Science" and "Engineering" lead other categories based on frequency and centrality respectively.

010       Multiscale mixing patterns in networks
021       Assortative mixing in networks is the tendency for nodes with the same attributes, or metadata, to link to each other. 
020       It is a property often found in social networks manifesting as a higher tendency of links occurring between people with the same age, race, or political belief. Quantifying the level of assortativity or disassortativity (the preference of linking to nodes with different attributes) can shed light on the factors involved in the formation of links and contagion processes in complex networks. It is common practice to measure the level of assortativity according to the assortativity coefficient, or modularity in the case of discrete-valued metadata. This global value is the average level of assortativity across the network and may not be a representative statistic when mixing patterns are heterogeneous. For example, a social network spanning the globe may exhibit local differences in mixing patterns as a consequence of differences in cultural norms. Here, we introduce an approach to localise this global measure so that we can describe the assortativity, across multiple scales, at the node level. Consequently we are able to capture and qualitatively evaluate the distribution of mixing patterns in the network. We find that for many real-world networks the distribution of assortativity is skewed, overdispersed and multimodal. Our method provides a clearer lens through which we can more closely examine mixing patterns in networks.

010       A network approach to topic models
021       One of the main computational and scientific challenges in the modern age is to extract useful information from unstructured texts. 
020       Topic models are one popular machine-learning approach which infers the latent topical structure of a collection of documents. Despite their success --- in particular of its most widely used variant called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) --- and numerous applications in sociology, history, and linguistics, topic models are known to suffer from severe conceptual and practical problems, e.g. a lack of justification for the Bayesian priors, discrepancies with statistical properties of real texts, and the inability to properly choose the number of topics. Here, we approach the problem of identifying topical structures by representing text corpora as bipartite networks of documents and words and using methods from community detection in complex networks, in particular stochastic block models (SBM). We show that our SBM-based approach constitutes a more principled and versatile framework for topic modeling solving the intrinsic limitations of Dirichlet-based models through a more general choice of nonparametric priors. It automatically detects the number of topics and hierarchically clusters both the words and documents. In practice, we demonstrate through the analysis of artificial and real corpora that our approach outperforms LDA in terms of statistical model selection.

010       Extractive Multi Document Summarization using Dynamical Measurements of   Complex Networks
021       Due to the large amount of textual information available on Internet, it is of paramount relevance to use techniques that find relevant and concise content. 
020       A typical task devoted to the identification of informative sentences in documents is the so called extractive document summarization task. In this paper, we use complex network concepts to devise an extractive Multi Document Summarization (MDS) method, which extracts the most central sentences from several textual sources. In the proposed model, texts are represented as networks, where nodes represent sentences and the edges are established based on the number of shared words. Differently from previous works, the identification of relevant terms is guided by the characterization of nodes via dynamical measurements of complex networks, including symmetry, accessibility and absorption time. The evaluation of the proposed system revealed that excellent results were obtained with particular dynamical measurements, including those based on the exploration of networks via random walks.

010       Complex network view of evolving manifolds
021       We study complex networks formed by triangulations and higher-dimensional simplicial complexes of closed evolving manifolds. 
020       In particular, for triangulations, the set of possible transformations of these networks is restricted by the condition that at each step, all the faces must be triangles. We show that each of these transformations can be performed in a sequence of steps, in which a single elementary transformation is applied in special order. Stochastic application of these operations leads to random networks with different architectures. We perform extensive numerical simulations and explore the geometries of growing and equilibrium complex networks generated by these transformations and their local structural properties. This characterization includes the Hausdorff and spectral dimensions of the resulting networks, their degree distributions, and various structural correlations. Our results reveal a rich zoo of architectures and geometries of these networks, some of which appear to be small worlds while others are finite-dimensional with Hausdorff dimension equal or higher than the original dimensionality of their simplex. The range of spectral dimensions of the evolving triangulations turns out to be from about 1.4 to infinity. Our models include manifolds with evolving topologies, for example, an $h$-holed torus with progressively growing number of holes. This evolving graph demonstrates features of a small-world network and has a particularly heavy-tailed degree distribution.

010       Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and   Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems

020       However, while cas researchers are inher-ently interested in an interdisciplinary comparison of models, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no single unified framework for facilitating the development, comparison, communication and validation of models across different scientific domains. In this thesis, we propose first steps towards such a unified framework using a combination of agent-based and complex network-based modeling approaches and guidelines formulated in the form of a set of four levels of usage, which allow multidisciplinary researchers to adopt a suitable framework level on the basis of available data types, their research study objectives and expected outcomes, thus allowing them to better plan and conduct their respective re-search case studies.

010       Bufferless transmission in complex networks
021       Complex bufferless networks such as on-chip networks and optical burst switching networks haven't been paid enough attention in network science. 
020       In complex bufferless networks, the store and forward mechanism is not applicable, since the network nodes are not allowed to buffer data packets. In this paper, we study the data transmission process in complex bufferless networks from the perspective of network science. Specifically, we use the Price model to generate the underlying network topological structures. We propose a delivery queue based deflection mechanism, which accompanies the efficient routing protocol, to transmit data packets in bufferless networks. We investigate the average deflection times, packets loss rate, average arrival time, and how the network topological structure and some other factors affect these transmission performances. Our work provides some clues for the architecture and routing design of bufferless networks.

010       Agent-based computing from multi-agent systems to agent-based Models: a   visual survey
021       Agent-Based Computing is a diverse research domain concerned with the building of intelligent software based on the concept of "agents". 
020       In this paper, we use Scientometric analysis to analyze all sub-domains of agent-based computing. Our data consists of 1,064 journal articles indexed in the ISI web of knowledge published during a twenty year period: 1990-2010. These were retrieved using a topic search with various keywords commonly used in sub-domains of agent-based computing. In our proposed approach, we have employed a combination of two applications for analysis, namely Network Workbench and CiteSpace - wherein Network Workbench allowed for the analysis of complex network aspects of the domain, detailed visualization-based analysis of the bibliographic data was performed using CiteSpace. Our results include the identification of the largest cluster based on keywords, the timeline of publication of index terms, the core journals and key subject categories. We also identify the core authors, top countries of origin of the manuscripts along with core research institutes. Finally, our results have interestingly revealed the strong presence of agent-based computing in a number of non-computing related scientific domains including Life Sciences, Ecological Sciences and Social Sciences.

010       Towards a Formal, Visual Framework of Emergent Cognitive Development of   Scholars
021       Understanding the cognitive evolution of researchers as they progress in the academia is an important but complex problem, a problem belonging to a class of problems, which often require the development of models for gaining further understanding in the intricacies of the domain. 
020       The research question that we address in this paper is how to effectively model this temporal cognitive mental development of prolific researchers. Our proposed solution to this problem is based on noting that the academic progression and notability of a researcher are linked with a progressive increase in the citation count for the scholar's refereed publications quantified using indices such as the Hirsch index. In other words, we propose the use of yearly cognitive increment of a scholar's cognition to be quantifiable using a function of the scholar's citation index, thereby considering the index as an indicator of the discrete approximation of the scholar's cognitive development. Using validated agent-based modeling, a paradigm presented as part of our previous work i.e. Cognitive Agent-based Computing framework, we present both formal as well as visual agent-based complex network representations for this cognitive evolution in the form of a Temporal Cognitive Level Network (TCLN) model. As a proof of the effectiveness of this approach, we demonstrate validation of the model using historic data of citations.

010       Empirical exploration of air traffic and human dynamics in terminal   airspaces
021       Air traffic is widely known as a complex, task-critical techno-social system, with numerous interactions between airspace, procedures, aircraft and air traffic controllers. 
020       In order to develop and deploy high-level operational concepts and automation systems scientifically and effectively, it is essential to conduct an in-depth investigation on the intrinsic traffic-human dynamics and characteristics, which is not widely seen in the literature. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-layer network to model and analyze air traffic systems. A Route-based Airspace Network (RAN) and Flight Trajectory Network (FTN) encapsulate critical physical and operational characteristics; an Integrated Flow-Driven Network (IFDN) and Interrelated Conflict-Communication Network (ICCN) are formulated to represent air traffic flow transmissions and intervention from air traffic controllers, respectively. Furthermore, a set of analytical metrics including network variables, complex network attributes, controllers' cognitive complexity, and chaotic metrics are introduced and applied in a case study of Guangzhou terminal airspace. Empirical results show the existence of fundamental diagram and macroscopic fundamental diagram at the route, sector and terminal levels. Moreover, the dynamics and underlying mechanisms of "ATCOs-flow" interactions are revealed and interpreted by adaptive meta-cognition strategies based on network analysis of the ICCN. Finally, at the system level, chaos is identified in conflict system and human behavioral system when traffic switch to the semi-stable or congested phase. This study offers analytical tools for understanding the complex human-flow interactions at potentially a broad range of air traffic systems, and underpins future developments and automation of intelligent air traffic management systems.

010       Network community detection using modularity density measures
021       Modularity, since its introduction, has remained one of the most widely used metrics to assess the quality of community structure in a complex network. 
020       However the resolution limit problem associated with modularity limits its applicability to networks with community sizes smaller than a certain scale. In the past various attempts have been made to solve this problem. More recently a new metric, modularity density, was introduced for the quality of community structure in networks in order to solve some of the known problems with modularity, particularly the resolution limit problem. Modularity density resolves some communities which are otherwise undetectable using modularity. However, we find that it does not solve the resolution limit problem completely by investigating some cases where it fails to detect expected community structures. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of this metric and show that it further reduces the resolution limit problem, effectively eliminating the problem in a wide range of networks.

010       Resilience of Core-Periphery Networks in the Case of Rich-Club
021       Core-periphery networks are structures that present a set of central and densely connected nodes, namely the core, and a set of non-central and sparsely connected nodes, namely the periphery. 
020       The rich-club refers to a set in which the highest degree nodes show a high density of connections. Thus, a network that displays a rich-club can be interpreted as a core-periphery network in which the core is made up by a number of hubs. In this paper, we test the resilience of networks showing a progressively denser rich-club and we observe how this structure is able to affect the network measures in terms of both cohesion and efficiency in information flow. Additionally, we consider the case in which, instead of making the core denser, we add links to the periphery. These two procedures of core and periphery thickening delineate a decision process in the placement of new links and allow us to conduct a scenario analysis that can be helpful in the comprehension and supervision of complex networks under the resilience perspective. The advantages of the two procedures, as well as their implications, are discussed in relation to both network effciency and node heterogeneity.

010       Structural Identifiability of Cyclic Graphical Models of Biological   Networks with Latent Variables
021       An efficient structural identifiability analysis algorithm is developed in this study for a broad range of network structures. 
020       The proposed method adopts the Wright's path coefficient method to generate identifiability equations in forms of symbolic polynomials, and then converts these symbolic equations to binary matrices (called identifiability matrix). Several matrix operations are introduced for identifiability matrix reduction with system equivalency maintained. Based on the reduced identifiability matrices, the structural identifiability of each parameter is determined. A number of benchmark models are used to verify the validity of the proposed approach. Finally, the network module for influenza A virus replication is employed as a real example to illustrate the application of the proposed approach in practice. The proposed approach can deal with cyclic networks with latent variables. The key advantage is that it intentionally avoids symbolic computation and is thus highly efficient. Also, this method is capable of determining the identifiability of each single parameter and is thus of higher resolution in comparison with many existing approaches. Overall, this study provides a basis for systematic examination and refinement of graphical models of biological networks from the identifiability point of view, and it has a significant potential to be extended to more complex network structures or high-dimensional systems.

010       Classifying Time-Varying Complex Networks on the Tensor Manifold
021       At the core of understanding dynamical systems is the ability to maintain and control the systems behavior that includes notions of robustness, heterogeneity, and/or regime-shift detection. 
020       Recently, to explore such functional properties, a convenient representation has been to model such dynamical systems as a weighted graph consisting of a finite, but very large number of interacting agents. This said, there exists very limited relevant statistical theory that is able cope with real-life data, i.e., how does perform simple analysis and/or statistics over a family of networks as opposed to a specific network or network-to-network variation. Here, we are interested in the analysis of network families whereby each network represents a point on an underlying statistical manifold. From this, we explore the Riemannian structure of the statistical (tensor) manifold in order to define notions of geodesics or shortest distance amongst such points as well as a statistical framework for time-varying complex networks for which we can utilize in higher order classification tasks.

010       Complexity Measures of Music
021       We present a technique to search for the presence of crucial events in music, based on the analysis of the music volume. 
020       Earlier work on this issue was based on the assumption that crucial events correspond to the change of music notes, with the interesting result that the complexity index of the crucial events is mu ~ 2, which is the same inverse power-law index of the dynamics of the brain. The search technique analyzes music volume and confirms the results of the earlier work, thereby contributing to the explanation as to why the brain is sensitive to music, through the phenomenon of complexity matching. Complexity matching has recently been interpreted as the transfer of multifractality from one complex network to another. For this reason we also examine the mulifractality of music, with the observation that the multifractal spectrum of a computer performance is significantly narrower than the multifractal spectrum of a human performance of the same musical score. We conjecture that although crucial events are demonstrably important for information transmission, they alone are not suficient to define musicality, which is more adequately measured by the multifractality spectrum.

010       Reconfigurable optical implementation of quantum complex networks
021       Network theory has played a dominant role in understanding the structure of complex systems and their dynamics. 
020       Recently, quantum complex networks, i.e. collections of quantum systems in a non-regular topology, have been explored leading to significant progress in a multitude of diverse contexts including, e.g., quantum transport, open quantum systems, quantum communication, extreme violation of local realism, and quantum gravity geometries. However, the question on how to produce and control general quantum complex networks in experimental laboratory has remained open. Here we propose an all optical and reconfigurable implementation of quantum complex networks. The experimental proposal is based on optical frequency combs, parametric processes, pulse shaping and multimode measurements allowing the arbitrary control of the number of the nodes (optical modes) and topology of the links (interactions between the modes) within the network. Moreover, we also show how to simulate quantum dynamics within the network combined with the ability to address its individual nodes. To demonstrate the versatility of these features, we discuss the implementation of two recently proposed probing techniques for quantum complex networks and structured environments. Overall, our general method for implementing quantum complex networks with reconfigurable set-up has potential to define an experimental playground for designing and controlling complex networks -- and dynamics therein -- for several quantum physical frameworks.

010       Algorithmic Networks: central time to trigger expected emergent   open-endedness
021       This article investigates emergence and complexity in complex systems that can share information on a network. 
020       To this end, we use a theoretical approach from information theory, computability theory, and complex networks. One key studied question is how much emergent complexity arises when a population of computable systems is networked compared with when this population is isolated. First, we define a general model for networked theoretical machines, which we call algorithmic networks. Then, we narrow our scope to investigate algorithmic networks that optimize the average fitnesses of nodes in which each node imitates the fittest neighbor and the randomly generated population is networked by a time-varying graph. We show that there are graph-topological conditions that make these algorithmic networks have the property of expected emergent open-endedness for large enough populations. In other words, the expected emergent algorithmic complexity of a node tends to infinity as the population size tends to infinity. Given a dynamic network, we show that these conditions imply the existence of a central time to trigger expected emergent open-endedness. Moreover, we show that networks with small diameter meet these conditions. We also discuss future research based on how our results are related to some problems in network science, information theory, computability theory, distributed computing, game theory, evolutionary biology, and synergy in complex systems.

010       Memory effects in gene regulatory networks reveal key properties of   dynamical spatial patterning
021       Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control cellular function and decision making during tissue development and homeostasis. 
020       Mathematical tools based on dynamical systems theory are often used to model these networks. The size and complexity of these models, however, mean that their behaviour is not always intuitive and the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to decipher. For this reason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are necessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori projection. By first converting a thermodynamic state ensemble model of gene regulation into mass action reactions we derive a general method that produces a set of time evolution equations for a subset of components of a network. The influence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions that describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in the bulk. We demonstrate that the method captures the full dynamics of a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif while simplifying analysis of the subnetwork and providing a natural interpretation of the memory functions. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate neural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network composed of four interacting transcription factors. This reveals the function of specific links within the neural tube network and identifies features of the regulatory structure that increase the robustness of the network to initial conditions. Taken together, the study provides evidence that Zwanzig-Mori projections offer powerful and effective tools for simplifying and exploring the behaviour of GRNs.

010       Leveraging local h-index to identify and rank influential spreaders in   networks
021       Identifying influential nodes in complex networks has received increasing attention for its great theoretical and practical applications in many fields. 
020       Traditional methods, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and coreness centrality, have more or less disadvantages in detecting influential nodes, which have been illustrated in related literatures. Recently, the h-index, which is utilized to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar, has been introduced to the network world to evaluate a node's spreading ability. However, this method assigns too many nodes with the same value, which leads to a resolution limit problem in distinguishing the real influence of these nodes. In this paper, we propose a local h-index centrality (LH-index) method for identifying and ranking influential nodes in networks. The LH-index method simultaneously takes into account of h-index values of the node itself and its neighbors, which is based on the idea that a node connects to more influential nodes will also be influential. According to the simulation results with the stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model in four real world networks and several simulated networks, we demonstrate the effectivity of the LH-index method in identifying influential nodes in networks.

010       Local probe for connectivity and coupling strength in quantum complex   networks
021       We develop a local probe to estimate the connectivity of complex quantum networks. 
020       Our results show how global properties of different classes of complex networks can be estimated - in quantitative manner with high accuracy - by coupling a probe to a single node of the network. Here, our interest is focused on probing the connectivity, i.e. the degree sequence, and the value of the coupling constant within the complex network. The scheme combines results on classical graph theory with the ability to develop quantum probes for networks of quantum harmonic oscillators. Whilst our results are proof-of-principle type, within the emerging field of quantum complex networks they may have potential applications for example to the efficient transfer of quantum information or energy or possibly to shed light on the connection between network structure and dynamics.

010       Clinical Decision Support Systems: A Visual Survey
021       Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) form an important area of research. 
020       In spite of its importance, it is difficult for researchers to evaluate the domain primarily because of a considerable spread of relevant literature in interdisciplinary domains. Previous surveys of CDSS have examined the domain from the perspective of individual disciplines. However, to the best of our knowledge, no visual scientometric survey of CDSS has previously been conducted which provides a broader spectrum of the domain with a horizon covering multiple disciplines. While traditional systematic literature surveys focus on analyzing literature using arbitrary results, visual surveys allow for the analysis of domains by using complex network-based analytical models. In this paper, we present a detailed visual survey of CDSS literature using important papers selected from highly cited sources in the Thomson Reuters web of science. We analyze the entire set of relevant literature indexed in the Web of Science database. Our key results include the discovery of the articles which have served as key turning points in literature. Additionally, we have identified highly cited authors and the key country of origin of top publications. We also present the Universities with the strongest citation bursts. Finally, our network analysis has also identified the key journals and subject categories both in terms of centrality and frequency. It is our belief that this paper will thus serve as an important role for researchers as well as clinical practitioners interested in identifying key literature and resources in the domain of clinical decision support.

010       Convex skeletons of complex networks
021       A convex network can be defined as a network such that every connected induced subgraph includes all the shortest paths between its nodes. 
020       Fully convex network would therefore be a collection of cliques stitched together in a tree. In this paper, we study the largest high-convexity part of empirical networks obtained by removing the least number of edges, which we call a convex skeleton. A convex skeleton is a generalization of a spanning tree in which each edge can be replaced by a clique of arbitrary size. We present different approaches for extracting convex skeletons and apply them to social collaboration and protein interactions networks, autonomous systems graphs and food webs. We show that the extracted convex skeletons retain the degree distribution, clustering, connectivity and also distances between the nodes, while making the shortest paths between the nodes largely unique. Moreover, in the Slovenian computer scientists coauthorship network, a convex skeleton retains the strongest ties between the authors, differently from a spanning tree or high-betweenness backbone and high-salience skeleton. A convex skeleton thus represents a simple definition of a network backbone with applications in coauthorship and other social collaboration networks.

In particular we characterize rigorously and explicitly the configuration of inputs responsible for failures and cascades, and analyze the propagation of failures, which often is not of nearest-neighbor type.

010       Stability of a Giant Connected Component in a Complex Network
021       We analyze the stability of the network's giant connected component under impact of adverse events, which we model through the link percolation. 
020       Specifically, we quantify the extent to which the largest connected component of a network consists of the same nodes, regardless of the specific set of deactivated links. Our results are intuitive in the case of single-layered systems: the presence of large degree nodes in a single-layered network ensures both its robustness and stability. In contrast, we find that interdependent networks that are robust to adverse events have unstable connected components. Our results bring novel insights to the design of resilient network topologies and the reinforcement of existing networked systems.

010       Solar Flares Complex Networks
021       We investigate the characteristics of the solar flares complex network. 
020       The limited predictability, non-linearity, and self-organized criticality of the flares allow us to study systems of flares in the field of the complex systems. Both the occurrence time and the location of flares detected from January 1, 2006 to July 21, 2016 are used to design the growing flares network. The solar surface is divided into cells with equal areas. The cells, which include flare(s), are considered as nodes of the network. The related links are equivalent to sympathetic flaring. The extracted features present that the network of flares follows quantitative measures of complexity. The power-law nature of the connectivity distribution with a degree exponent greater than three reveals that flares form a scale-free and small-world network. The great value of the clustering coefficient, small characteristic path length, and slowly change of the diameter are all characteristics of the flares network. We show that the degree correlation of the flares network has the characteristics of a disassortative network. About 11% of the large energetic flares (M and X types in GOES classification) that occurred in the network hubs cover 3% of the solar surface.

021       In this paper we propose a deterministic mathematical model that attempts to explain the propagation of a rumor using SIRS type epidemiological models with temporary immunity and nonlinear incidence rate. 
020       In particular, we speculate about the dissemination of information when the so-called "complex networks" are used. The effect of introducing a second rumor, inspired by a vaccination model, in the same population of individuals, which will try to counteract the effect of the original rumor, is studied. That is a situation that occurs frequently in communities, when a rumor is counteracted by a contrary information or news, which behaves in the same way as a rumor. Furthermore, qualitative analysis and numerical experimentation of the dynamic model are performed. We corroborate that the dynamics of spreading rumors show similar behavior to that found in the dynamics of an infectious disease.

010       Navigability of temporal networks in hyperbolic space
021       Information routing is one of the main tasks in many complex networks with a communication function. 
020       Maps produced by embedding the networks in hyperbolic space can assist this task enabling the implementation of efficient navigation strategies. However, only static maps have been considered so far, while navigation in more realistic situations, where the network structure may vary in time, remain largely unexplored. Here, we analyze the navigability of real networks by using greedy routing in hyperbolic space, where the nodes are subject to a stochastic activation-inactivation dynamics. We find that such dynamics enhances navigability with respect to the static case. Interestingly, there exists an optimal intermediate activation value, which ensures the best trade-off between the increase in the number of successful paths and a limited growth of their length. Contrary to expectations, the enhanced navigability is robust even when the most connected nodes inactivate with very high probability. Finally, our results indicate that some real networks are ultranavigable and remain highly navigable even if the network structure is extremely unsteady. These findings have important implications for the design and evaluation of efficient routing protocols that account for the temporal nature of real complex networks.

010       Individual Differences in Learning Social and Non-Social Network   Structures
021       Learning about complex associations between pieces of information enables individuals to quickly adjust their expectations and develop mental models. 
020       Yet, the degree to which humans can learn higher-order information about complex associations is not well understood; nor is it known whether the learning process differs for social and non-social information. Here, we employ a paradigm in which the order of stimulus presentation forms temporal associations between the stimuli, collectively constituting a complex network structure. We examined individual differences in the ability to learn network topology for which stimuli were social versus non-social. Although participants were able to learn both social and non-social networks, their performance in social network learning was uncorrelated with their performance in non-social network learning. Importantly, social traits, including social orientation and perspective-taking, uniquely predicted the learning of social networks but not the learning of non-social networks. Taken together, our results suggest that the process of learning higher-order structure in social networks is independent from the process of learning higher-order structure in non-social networks. Our study design provides a promising approach to identify neurophysiological drivers of social network versus non-social network learning, extending our knowledge about the impact of individual differences on these learning processes. Implications for how people learn and adapt to new social contexts that require integration into a new social network are discussed.

010       Local Edge Betweenness based Label Propagation for Community Detection   in Complex Networks
021       Nowadays, identification and detection community structures in complex networks is an important factor in extracting useful information from networks. 
020       Label propagation algorithm with near linear-time complexity is one of the most popular methods for detecting community structures, yet its uncertainty and randomness is a defective factor. Merging LPA with other community detection metrics would improve its accuracy and reduce instability of LPA. Considering this point, in this paper we tried to use edge betweenness centrality to improve LPA performance. On the other hand, calculating edge betweenness centrality is expensive, so as an alternative metric, we try to use local edge betweenness and present LPA-LEB (Label Propagation Algorithm Local Edge Betweenness). Experimental results on both real-world and benchmark networks show that LPA-LEB possesses higher accuracy and stability than LPA when detecting community structures in networks.

010       Attractors in complex networks
021       In the framework of the generalized Lotka Volterra model, solutions representing multispecies sequencial competition can be predictable with high probability. 
020       In this paper, we show that it occurs because the corresponding "heteroclinic channel" forms part of an attractor. We prove that, generically, in an attracting heteroclinic network involving a finite number of hyperbolic and non-resonant saddle-equilibria whose linearization has only real eigenvalues, the connections corresponding to the most positive expanding eigenvalues form a part of an attractor (observable in numerical simulations).

010       Optimal subgraph structures in scale-free configuration models
021       Subgraphs reveal information about the geometry and functionalities of complex networks. 
020       For scale-free networks with unbounded degree fluctuations, we count the number of times a small connected graph occurs as a subgraph (motif counting) or as an induced subgraph (graphlet counting). We obtain these results by analyzing the configuration model with degree exponent $\tau\in(2,3)$ and introducing a novel class of optimization problems. For any given subgraph, the unique optimizer describes the degrees of the nodes that together span the subgraph. We find that every subgraph occurs typically between vertices with specific degree ranges. In this way, we can count and characterize {\it all} subgraphs. We refrain from double counting in the case of multi-edges, essentially counting the subgraphs in the {\it erased} configuration model.

010       Adversarial Discriminative Heterogeneous Face Recognition
021       The gap between sensing patterns of different face modalities remains a challenging problem in heterogeneous face recognition (HFR). 
020       This paper proposes an adversarial discriminative feature learning framework to close the sensing gap via adversarial learning on both raw-pixel space and compact feature space. This framework integrates cross-spectral face hallucination and discriminative feature learning into an end-to-end adversarial network. In the pixel space, we make use of generative adversarial networks to perform cross-spectral face hallucination. An elaborate two-path model is introduced to alleviate the lack of paired images, which gives consideration to both global structures and local textures. In the feature space, an adversarial loss and a high-order variance discrepancy loss are employed to measure the global and local discrepancy between two heterogeneous distributions respectively. These two losses enhance domain-invariant feature learning and modality independent noise removing. Experimental results on three NIR-VIS databases show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art HFR methods, without requiring of complex network or large-scale training dataset.

010       Observational Equivalence in System Estimation: Contractions in Complex   Networks
021       Observability of complex systems/networks is the focus of this paper, which is shown to be closely related to the concept of contraction. 
020       Indeed, for observable network tracking it is necessary/sufficient to have one node in each contraction measured. Therefore, nodes in a contraction are equivalent to recover for loss of observability, implying that contraction size is a key factor for observability recovery. Here, using a polynomial order contraction detection algorithm, we analyze the distribution of contractions, studying its relation with key network properties. Our results show that contraction size is related to network clustering coefficient and degree heterogeneity. Particularly, in networks with power-law degree distribution, if the clustering coefficient is high there are less contractions with smaller size on average. The implication is that estimation/tracking of such systems requires less number of measurements, while their observational recovery is more restrictive in case of sensor failure. Further, in Small-World networks higher degree heterogeneity implies that there are more contractions with smaller size on average. Therefore, the estimation of representing system requires more measurements, and also the recovery of measurement failure is more limited. These results imply that one can tune the properties of synthetic networks to alleviate their estimation/observability recovery.

For both networks, we determine their matching number, domination number, the number of maximum matchings, as well as the number of minimum dominating sets.

010       Extended corona product as an exactly tractable model for weighted   heterogeneous networks
021       Various graph products and operations have been widely used to construct complex networks with common properties of real-life systems. 
020       However, current works mainly focus on designing models of binary networks, in spite of the fact that many real networks can be better mimicked by heterogeneous weighted networks. In this paper, we develop a corona product of two weighted graphs, based on which and an observed updating mechanism of edge weight in real networks, we propose a minimal generative model for inhomogeneous weighted networks. We derive analytically relevant properties of the weighted network model, including strength, weight and degree distributions, clustering coefficient, degree correlations and diameter. These properties are in good agreement with those observed in diverse real-world weighted networks. We then determine all the eigenvalues and their corresponding multiplicities of the transition probability matrix for random walks on the weighted networks. Finally, we apply the obtained spectra to derive explicit expressions for mean hitting time of random walks and weighted counting of spanning trees on the weighted networks. Our model is an exactly solvable one, allowing to analytically treat its structural and dynamical properties, which is thus a good test-bed and an ideal substrate network for studying different dynamical processes, in order to explore the impacts of heterogeneous weight distribution on these processes.

010       Network Controllability in the IFG Relates to Controlled Language   Variability and Susceptibility to TMS
021       In language production, humans are confronted with considerable word selection demands. 
020       Often, we must select a word from among similar, acceptable, and competing alternative words in order to construct a sentence that conveys an intended meaning. In recent years, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) has been identified as critical to this ability. Despite a recent emphasis on network approaches to understanding language, how the LIFG interacts with the brain's complex networks to facilitate controlled language performance remains unknown. Here, we take a novel approach to understand word selection as a network control process in the brain. Using an anatomical brain network derived from high-resolution diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI), we computed network controllability underlying the site of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the LIFG between administrations of two word selection tasks. We find that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of difficult-to-reach states explains vulnerability to TMS in language tasks that vary in response (cognitive control) demands: open-response (word generation) vs. closed-response (number naming) tasks. Moreover, we find that a statistic that quantifies the LIFG's theoretically predicted control of communication across modules in the human connectome explains TMS-induced changes in open-response language task performance only. These findings establish a link between network controllability, cognitive function, and TMS effects.

010       Degree weighted recurrence networks for the analysis of time series data
021       Recurrence networks are powerful tools used effectively in the nonlinear analysis of time series data. 
020       The analysis in this context is done mostly with unweighted and undirected complex networks constructed with specific criteria from the time series. In this work, we propose a novel method to construct "weighted recurrence network"(WRN) from a time series and show how it can reveal useful information regarding the structure of a chaotic attractor, which the usual unweighted recurrence network cannot provide. Especially, we find the node strength distribution of the WRN, from every chaotic attractor follows a power law (with exponential tail) with the index characteristic to the fractal structure of the attractor. This leads to a new class among complex networks, to which networks from all standard chaotic attractors are found to belong. In addition, we present generalized definitions for clustering coefficient and characteristic path length and show that these measures can effectively discriminate chaotic dynamics from white noise and $1/f$ colored noise. Our results indicate that the WRN and the associated measures can become potentially important tools for the analysis of short and noisy time series from the real world systems as they are clearly demarked from that of noisy or stochastic systems.

010       Dissecting the Spatial Structure of Cities from Human Mobility Patterns   to Define Functional Urban Boundaries
021       Since the industrial revolution, accelerated urban growth has overflown administrative divisions, merged cities into large built extensions, and blurred the boundaries between urban and rural land-uses. 
020       These traits, present in most of contemporary metropolis, complicate the definition of cities, a crucial issue considering that objective and comparable metrics are the basic inputs needed for the planning and design of sustainable urban environments. In this context, city definitions that respond to administrative or political criteria usually overlook human dynamics, a key factor that could help to make cities comparable across the urban fabric of diverse social, cultural and economic realities. Using a technique based on the spectral analysis of complex networks, we rank places in 11 of the major Chilean urban regions from a high-resolution human mobility dataset: Official origin-destination (OD) surveys. We propose a method for further distinguishing urban and rural land-uses within these regions, by means of a network centrality measure from which we construct a spectre of geographic places. This spectre, constructed from the ranking of locations as measured by their approximate number of embedded human flows, allows us to probe several urban boundaries. From the analysis of the urban scaling exponent of trips in relation to the population across these city delineations, we identify two clearly distinct scaling regimes occurring in urban and rural areas. The comparison of our results with land cover derived from remote sensing suggests that, for the case of trips, the scaling exponent in urban areas is close to linear. We conclude with estimations for well-formed cities in the Chilean urban system, which according to our analysis could emerge from clusters composed by places that capture at least ~138 trips (over the expectation) of the underlying mobility network.

020       We consider the simultaneous detection of communities and anti-communities, by looking at spectral methods based on various matrix-based definitions of the modularity of a vertex set. Invariant subspaces associated to extreme eigenvalues of these matrices provide indications on the presence of both kinds of modular structure in the network. The localization of the relevant invariant subspaces can be estimated by looking at particular matrix angles based on Frobenius inner products.

010       Core-biased random walks in complex networks
021       A simple strategy to explore a network is to use a random-walk where the walker jumps from one node to an adjacent node at random. 
020       It is known that biasing the random jump, the walker can explore every walk of the same length with equal probability, this is known as a Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW). To construct a MERW requires the knowledge of the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of the adjacency matrix, this requires global knowledge of the network. When this global information is not available, it is possible to construct a biased random walk which approximates the MERW using only the degree of the nodes, a local property. Here we show that it is also possible to construct a good approximation to a MERW by biasing the random walk via the properties of the network's core, which is a mesoscale property of the network. We present some examples showing that the core-biased random walk outperforms the degree-biased random walks.

Then, we estimate many topological measures on the obtained networks, and apply multivariate statistics and data analysis methods to study and compare the topologies. Remarkably, the obtained results show that cities from specific continents, especially Anglo-Saxon America, tend to have particular topological properties. Such developments should contribute to better understanding how cities are organized and related to different geographical locations worldwide.

010       Delay-time distribution in the scattering of time-narrow wave packets   (II) - Quantum Graphs

020       Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 215301) to compute the time-delay distribution in the scattering of ultra short radio frequency pulses on complex networks of transmission lines which are modeled by metric (quantum) graphs. We consider wave packets which are centered at high wave number and comprise many energy levels. In the limit of pulses of very short duration we compute upper and lower bounds to the actual time-delay distribution of the radiation emerging from the network using a simplified problem where time is replaced by the discrete count of vertex-scattering events. The classical limit of the time-delay distribution is also discussed and we show that for finite networks it decays exponentially, with a decay constant which depends on the graph connectivity and the distribution of its edge lengths. We illustrate and apply our theory to a simple model graph where an algebraic decay of the quantum time-delay distribution is established.

010       From time-series to complex networks: Application to the cerebrovascular   flow patterns in atrial fibrillation
021       A network-based approach is presented to investigate the cerebrovascular flow patterns during atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). 
020       AF, the most common cardiac arrhythmia with faster and irregular beating, has been recently and independently associated with the increased risk of dementia. However, the underlying hemodynamic mechanisms relating the two pathologies remain mainly undetermined so far; thus the contribution of modeling and refined statistical tools is valuable. Pressure and flow rate temporal series in NSR and AF are here evaluated along representative cerebral sites (from carotid arteries to capillary brain circulation), exploiting reliable artificially built signals recently obtained from an in silico approach. The complex network analysis evidences, in a synthetic and original way, a dramatic signal variation towards the distal/capillary cerebral regions during AF, which has no counterpart in NSR conditions. At the large artery level, networks obtained from both AF and NSR hemodynamic signals exhibit elongated and chained features, which are typical of pseudo-periodic series. These aspects are almost completely lost towards the microcirculation during AF, where the networks are topologically more circular and present random-like characteristics. As a consequence, all the physiological phenomena at microcerebral level ruled by periodicity - such as regular perfusion, mean pressure per beat, and average nutrient supply at cellular level - can be strongly compromised, since the AF hemodynamic signals assume irregular behaviour and random-like features. Through a powerful approach which is complementary to the classical statistical tools, the present findings further strengthen the potential link between AF hemodynamic and cognitive decline.

010       Generalized Sparse and Low-Rank Optimization for Ultra-Dense Networks
021       Ultra-dense network (UDN) is a promising technology to further evolve wireless networks and meet the diverse performance requirements of 5G networks. 
020       With abundant access points, each with communication, computation and storage resources, UDN brings unprecedented benefits, including significant improvement in network spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, greatly reduced latency to enable novel mobile applications, and the capability of providing massive access for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, such great promises come with formidable research challenges. To design and operate such complex networks with various types of resources, efficient and innovative methodologies will be needed. This motivates the recent introduction of highly structured and generalizable models for network optimization. In this article, we present some recently proposed large-scale sparse and low-rank frameworks for optimizing UDNs, supported by various motivating applications. A special attention is paid on algorithmic approaches to deal with nonconvex objective functions and constraints, as well as computational scalability.

010       Random Overlapping Communities: Approximating Motif Densities of Large   Graphs
021       A wide variety of complex networks (social, biological, information etc.) exhibit local clustering with substantial variation in the clustering coefficient (the probability of neighbors being connected). 
020       Existing models of large graphs capture power law degree distributions (Barab\'asi-Albert) and small-world properties (Watts-Strogatz), but only limited clustering behavior. We introduce a generalization of the classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model of random graphs which provably achieves a wide range of desired clustering coefficient, triangle-to-edge and four-cycle-to-edge ratios for any given graph size and edge density. Rather than choosing edges independently at random, in the Random Overlapping Communities model, a graph is generated by choosing a set of random, relatively dense subgraphs ("communities"). We discuss the explanatory power of the model and some of its consequences.

010       On the Complex Network Structure of Musical Pieces: Analysis of Some Use   Cases from Different Music Genres
021       This paper focuses on the modeling of musical melodies as networks. 
020       Notes of a melody can be treated as nodes of a network. Connections are created whenever notes are played in sequence. We analyze some main tracks coming from different music genres, with melodies played using different musical instruments. We find out that the considered networks are, in general, scale free networks and exhibit the small world property. We measure the main metrics and assess whether these networks can be considered as formed by sub-communities. Outcomes confirm that peculiar features of the tracks can be extracted from this analysis methodology. This approach can have an impact in several multimedia applications such as music didactics, multimedia entertainment, and digital music generation.

010       Coarse Grain Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Fibrin Polymerization
021       Studies suggests that patients with deep vein thrombosis and diabetes often have hy-per coagulable blood plasma leading to higher chances of forming thromboembolisms by the rupture of blood clots, which may lead to stroke and death. 
020       Despite the advances in the field of blood clot formation and lysis research, the change in mechanical properties and its impli-cation into the formation of thromboembolisms in platelet poor plasma is poorly understood. In this paper, we present a new computational method to simulate fibrin clot formation using molecular simulations. With an effective combination of reactive molecular dynamics con-cept and coarse graining principle, we have utilized the reactive coarse grain molecular dy-namics to predict the complex network formation of fibrin clots and the branching of the fi-brins. The heavy 340 kDa fibrinogen is converted into a simple spring-bead coarse grain sys-tem with 9 beads, and using our customized reactive potentials, we simulated the formation of the fibrin clot. Thus, formed fibrin clot agrees with the experimental results qualitatively, and to our best knowledge this is the first kind of molecular polymerization study of fibrin clot which can lead to improve our understanding about blood clot formation and its relation-ship with mechanical properties.

010       Azimuthal Anisotropy in High Energy Nuclear Collision - An Approach   based on Complex Network Analysis
021       Recently, a complex network based method of Visibility Graph has been applied to confirm the scale-freeness and presence of fractal properties in the process of multiplicity fluctuation. 
020       Analysis of data obtained from experiments on hadron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions results in values of Power-of-Scale-freeness-of-Visibility-Graph-(PSVG) parameter extracted from the visibility graphs. Here, the relativistic nucleus-nucleus interaction data have been analysed to detect azimuthal-anisotropy by extending the Visibility Graph method and extracting the average clustering coefficient, one of the important topological parameters, from the graph. Azimuthal-distributions corresponding to different pseudorapidity-regions around the central-pseudorapidity value are analysed utilising the parameter. Here we attempt to correlate the conventional physical significance of this coefficient with respect to complex-network systems, with some basic notions of particle production phenomenology, like clustering and correlation. Earlier methods for detecting anisotropy in azimuthal distribution, were mostly based on the analysis of statistical fluctuation. In this work, we have attempted to find deterministic information on the anisotropy in azimuthal distribution by means of precise determination of topological parameter from a complex network perspective.

010       From Ecology to Finance (and Back?): Recent Advancements in the Analysis   of Bipartite Networks
021       Bipartite networks provide an insightful representation of many systems, ranging from mutualistic networks of species interactions to investment networks in finance. 
020       The analysis of their topological structures has revealed the ubiquitous presence of properties which seem to characterize many - apparently different - systems. Nestedness, for example, has been observed in plants-pollinator as well as in country-product trade networks. This has raised questions about the significance of these patterns, which are often believed to constitute a genuine signature of self-organization. Here, we review several methods that have been developed for the analysis of such evidence. Due to the interdisciplinary character of complex networks, tools developed in one field, for example ecology, can greatly enrich other areas of research, such as economy and finance, and vice versa. With this in mind, we briefly review several entropy-based bipartite null models that have been recently proposed and discuss their application to several real-world systems. The focus on these models is motivated by the fact that they show three very desirable features: analytical character, general applicability and versatility. In this respect, entropy-based methods have been proven to perform satisfactorily both in providing benchmarks for testing evidence-based null hypotheses and in reconstructing unknown network configurations from partial information. On top of that, entropy-based models have been successfully employed to analyze ecological as well as economic systems, thus representing an ideal, interdisciplinary tool to approach the study of bipartite complex systems.

010       Common neighbor based degree distribution of complex networks
021       Unveiling the general structural properties of various complex networks is one of the main tasks in network science. 
020       We define the degree of a bunch of nodes as the number of common neighbors they share in the network, namely common neighbor based degree (CNBD). We provide a general model, namely unified ring model, which unifies all the ring based models. We propose a general framework based on the generating function to calculate the CNBD distributions of complex networks. We find that in the ER network, the CNBD distribution obey the Poisson law for node sets of any size. We also study the CNBD distribution for the other types of complex networks including the regular ring lattice, small-world model, scale-free model, and real-world networks.

010       Characterizing the structural diversity of complex networks across   domains
021       The structure of complex networks has been of interest in many scientific and engineering disciplines over the decades. 
020       A number of studies in the field have been focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networks such as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structure and they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex networks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across a diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity we observe in the real-world networks. In this paper, we study 986 real-world networks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social networks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models. Our study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random forest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network domains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are some partitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish based purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of network categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints and/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same partition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of engineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network, whether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a decisive factor of the formation of similar network structure. Our findings shed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden principles for the structural diversity of complex networks.

010       Global Rank Estimation
021       In real world complex networks, the importance of a node depends on two important parameters: 1. 
020       characteristics of the node, and 2. the context of the given application. The current literature contains several centrality measures that have been defined to measure the importance of a node based on the given application requirements. These centrality measures assign a centrality value to each node that denotes its importance index. But in real life applications, we are more interested in the relative importance of the node that can be measured using its centrality rank based on the given centrality measure. To compute the centrality rank of a node, we need to compute the centrality value of all the nodes and compare them to get the rank. This process requires the entire network. So, it is not feasible for real-life applications due to the large size and dynamic nature of real world networks. In the present project, we aim to propose fast and efficient methods to estimate the global centrality rank of a node without computing the centrality value of all nodes. These methods can be further extended to estimate the rank without having the entire network. The proposed methods use the structural behavior of centrality measures, sampling techniques, or the machine learning models. In this work, we also discuss how to apply these methods for degree and closeness centrality rank estimation.

010       Computing Top-k Closeness Centrality in Fully-dynamic Graphs
021       Closeness is a widely-studied centrality measure. 
020       Since it requires all pairwise distances, computing closeness for all nodes is infeasible for large real-world networks. However, for many applications, it is only necessary to find the k most central nodes and not all closeness values. Prior work has shown that computing the top-k nodes with highest closeness can be done much faster than computing closeness for all nodes in real-world networks. However, for networks that evolve over time, no dynamic top-k closeness algorithm exists that improves on static recomputation. In this paper, we present several techniques that allow us to efficiently compute the k nodes with highest (harmonic) closeness after an edge insertion or an edge deletion. Our algorithms use information obtained during earlier computations to omit unnecessary work. However, they do not require asymptotically more memory than the static algorithms (i. e., linear in the number of nodes). We propose separate algorithms for complex networks (which exhibit the small-world property) and networks with large diameter such as street networks, and we compare them against static recomputation on a variety of real-world networks. On many instances, our dynamic algorithms are two orders of magnitude faster than recomputation; on some large graphs, we even reach average speedups between $10^3$ and $10^4$.

010       Network models of financial systemic risk: A review
021       The global financial system can be represented as a large complex network in which banks, hedge funds and other financial institutions are interconnected to each other through visible and invisible financial linkages. 
020       Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the understanding of the mechanisms that can lead to a breakdown of this network. This can happen when the existing financial links turn from being a means of risk diversification to channels for the propagation of risk across financial institutions. In this review article, we summarize recent developments in the modeling of financial systemic risk. We focus in particular on network approaches, such as models of default cascades due to bilateral exposures or to overlapping portfolios, and we also report on recent findings on the empirical structure of interbank networks. The current review provides a landscape of the newly arising interdisciplinary field lying at the intersection of several disciplines, such as network science, physics, engineering, economics, and ecology.

010       Geometric evolution of complex networks
021       We present a general class of geometric network growth mechanisms by homogeneous attachment in which the links created at a given time $t$ are distributed homogeneously between a new node and the exising nodes selected uniformly. 
020       This is achieved by creating links between nodes uniformly distributed in a homogeneous metric space according to a Fermi-Dirac connection probability with inverse temperature $\beta$ and general time-dependent chemical potential $\mu(t)$. The chemical potential limits the spatial extent of newly created links. Using a hidden variable framework, we obtain an analytical expression for the degree sequence and show that $\mu(t)$ can be fixed to yield any given degree distributions, including a scale-free degree distribution. Additionally, we find that depending on the order in which nodes appear in the network---its $\textit{history}$---the degree-degree correlation can be tuned to be assortative or disassortative. The effect of the geometry on the structure is investigated through the average clustering coefficient $\langle c \rangle$. In the thermodynamic limit, we identify a phase transition between a random regime where $\langle c \rangle \rightarrow 0$ when $\beta &lt; \beta_\mathrm{c}$ and a geometric regime where $\langle c \rangle &gt; 0$ when $\beta &gt; \beta_\mathrm{c}$.

010       Revealing the phase transition behaviors of k-core percolation in random   networks
021       The $k$-core percolation is a fundamental structural transition in complex networks. 
020       Through the analysis of the size jump behaviors of $k$-core in the evolution process of networks, we confirm that $k$-core percolation is continuous phase transition when $k=1,2$ while it is a hybrid first-order-second-order phase transition when $k\ge 3$. $2$-core percolation belongs to different universality class from that of $1$-core (giant component) percolation. The discontinuity of $k$-core percolation with $k\ge 3$ can be concluded from largest size jump of $k$-core which will not disappear in the thermodynamic limit while its continuous characteristic is reflected by second largest size jump which converges to zero in power law as $N\to \infty$. Furthermore, along with the previously known exponent $\beta=0.5$, we obtain a set of exponents which are independent of $k$ when $k\ge 3$ and also different from those critical exponents of $1$-core and $2$-core percolation.

010       Towards Agent-Based Model Specification in Smart Grid: A Cognitive   Agent-based Computing Approach
021       A smart grid can be considered as a complex network where each node represents a generation unit or a consumer. 
020       Whereas links can be used to represent transmission lines. One way to study complex systems is by using the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm. An ABM is a way of representing a complex system of autonomous agents interacting with each other. Previously, a number of studies have been presented in the smart grid domain making use of the ABM paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have focused on the specification aspect of ABM. An ABM specification is important not only for understanding but also for replication of the model. In this study, we focus on development as well as specification of ABM for smart grid. We propose an ABM by using a combination of agent-based and complex network-based approaches. For ABM specification, we use ODD and DREAM specification approaches. We analyze these two specification approaches qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DREAM is a most useful approach as compared with ODD for modeling as well as for replication of models for smart grid.

010       Underestimated cost of targeted attacks on complex networks
021       The robustness of complex networks under targeted attacks is deeply connected to the resilience of complex systems, i.e., the ability to make appropriate responses to the attacks. 
020       In this article, we investigated the state-of-the-art targeted node attack algorithms and demonstrate that they become very inefficient when the cost of the attack is taken into consideration. In this paper, we made explicit assumption that the cost of removing a node is proportional to the number of adjacent links that are removed, i.e., higher degree nodes have higher cost. Finally, for the case when it is possible to attack links, we propose a simple and efficient edge removal strategy named Hierarchical Power Iterative Normalized cut (HPI-Ncut).The results on real and artificial networks show that the HPI-Ncut algorithm outperforms all the node removal and link removal attack algorithms when the cost of the attack is taken into consideration. In addition, we show that on sparse networks, the complexity of this hierarchical power iteration edge removal algorithm is only $O(n\log^{2+\epsilon}(n))$.

010       Fractal and multifractal analysis of complex networks: Estonian network   of payments
021       Complex networks have gained much attention from different areas of knowledge in recent years. 
020       Particularly, the structures and dynamics of such systems have attracted considerable interest. Complex networks may have characteristics of multifractality. In this study, we analyze fractal and multifractal properties of a novel network: the large scale economic network of payments of Estonia, where companies are represented by nodes and the payments done between companies are represented by links. We present a fractal scaling analysis and examine the multifractal behavior of this network by using a sandbox algorithm. Our results indicate the existence of multifractality in this network and consequently, the existence of multifractality in the Estonian economy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that analyzes multifractality of a complex network of payments.

010       Symmetries in the time-averaged dynamics of networks: reducing   unnecessary complexity through minimal network models
021       Complex networks are the subject of fundamental interest from the scientific community at large. 
020       Several metrics have been introduced to characterize the structure of these networks, such as the degree distribution, degree correlation, path length, clustering coefficient, centrality measures etc. Another important feature is the presence of network symmetries. In particular, the effect of these symmetries has been studied in the context of network synchronization, where they have been used to predict the emergence and stability of cluster synchronous states. Here we provide theoretical, numerical, and experimental evidence that network symmetries play a role in a substantially broader class of dynamical models on networks, including epidemics, game theory, communication, and coupled excitable systems. Namely, we see that in all these models, nodes that are related by a symmetry relation show the same time-averaged dynamical properties. This discovery leads us to propose reduction techniques for exact, yet minimal, simulation of complex networks dynamics, which we show are effective in order to optimize the use of computational resources, such as computation time and memory.

010       Weighted H-index for identifying influential spreaders
021       Spreading is a ubiquitous process in the social, biological and technological systems. 
020       Therefore, identifying influential spreaders, which is important to prevent epidemic spreading and to establish effective vaccination strategies, is full of theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, a weighted h-index centrality based on virtual nodes extension is proposed to quantify the spreading influence of nodes in complex networks. Simulation results on real-world networks reveal that the proposed method provides more accurate and more consistent ranking than the five classical methods. Moreover, we observe that the monotonicity and the computational complexity of our measure can also yield excellent performance.

010       Quantitative Graph Theory: A new branch of graph theory and in network   science
021       In this paper, we describe {\sc quantitative graph theory} and argue it is a new graph-theoretical branch in network science, however, with significant different features compared to classical graph theory. 
020       The main goal of quantitative graph theory is the structural quantification of information contained in complex networks by employing a {\it measurement approach} based on numerical invariants and comparisons. Furthermore, the methods as well as the networks do not need to be deterministic but can be statistic. As such this complements the field of classical graph theory, which is descriptive and deterministic in nature. We provide examples of how quantitative graph theory can be used for novel applications in the context of the overarching concept network science.

010       An energy-speed-accuracy relation in complex networks for biological   discrimination
021       Discriminating between correct and incorrect substrates is a core process in biology but how is energy apportioned between the conflicting demands of accuracy ($\mu$), speed ($\sigma$) and total entropy production rate ($P$)? Previous studies have focussed on biochemical networks with simple structure or relied on simplifying kinetic assumptions. 
020       Here, we use the linear framework for timescale separation to analytically examine steady-state probabilities away from thermodynamic equilibrium for networks of arbitrary complexity. We also introduce a method of scaling parameters that is inspired by Hopfield's treatment of kinetic proofreading. Scaling allows asymptotic exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces. We identify in this way a broad class of complex networks and scalings for which the quantity $\sigma\ln(\mu)/P$ remains asymptotically finite whenever accuracy improves from equilibrium, so that $\mu_{eq}/\mu \to 0$. Scalings exist, however, even for Hopfield's original network, for which $\sigma\ln(\mu)/P$ is asymptotically infinite, illustrating the parametric complexity. Outside the asymptotic regime, numerical calculations suggest that, under more restrictive parametric assumptions, networks satisfy the bound, $\sigma\ln(\mu/\mu_{eq})/P &lt; 1$, and we discuss the biological implications for discrimination by ribosomes and DNA polymerase. The methods introduced here may be more broadly useful for analysing complex networks that implement other forms of cellular information processing.

010       Internet Anomaly Detection based on Complex Network Path
021       Detecting the anomaly behaviors such as network failure or Internet intentional attack in the large-scale Internet is a vital but challenging task. 
020       While numerous techniques have been developed based on Internet traffic in past years, anomaly detection for structured datasets by complex network have just been of focus recently. In this paper, a anomaly detection method for large-scale Internet topology is proposed by considering the changes of network crashes. In order to quantify the dynamic changes of Internet topology, the network path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which will highlight the Internet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously. Furthermore we proposed the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to determine whether the Internet is abnormal or not. That is the current Internet is abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain which structured by the previous k NPCCs of Internet topology. Finally the new Internet anomaly detection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly events. The results show that the detection accuracy of all events are over 97%, the detection precision of each event are 90.24%, 83.33% and 66.67%, when k = 36. According to the experimental values of the index F_1, we found the the better the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has better performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than that caused by intentional attack. Compared with traditional anomaly detection, our work may be more simple and powerful for the government or organization in items of detecting large-scale abnormal events.

010       Optimal Control of Interdependent Epidemics in Complex Networks
021       Optimal control of interdependent epidemics spreading over complex networks is a critical issue. 
020       We first establish a framework to capture the coupling between two epidemics, and then analyze the system's equilibrium states by categorizing them into three classes, and deriving their stability conditions. The designed control strategy globally optimizes the trade-off between the control cost and the severity of epidemics in the network. A gradient descent algorithm based on a fixed point iterative scheme is proposed to find the optimal control strategy. The optimal control will lead to switching between equilibria of the interdependent epidemics network. Case studies are used to corroborate the theoretical results finally.

010       Identifying an influential spreader from a single seed in complex   networks via a message-passing approach
021       Identifying the most influential spreaders is one of outstanding problems in physics of complex systems. 
020       So far, many approaches have attempted to rank the influence of nodes but there is still the lack of accuracy to single out influential spreaders. Here, we directly tackle the problem of finding important spreaders by solving analytically the expected size of epidemic outbreaks when spreading originates from a single seed. We derive and validate a theory for calculating the size of epidemic outbreaks with a single seed using a message-passing approach. In addition, we find that the probability to occur epidemic outbreaks is highly dependent on the location of the seed but the size of epidemic outbreaks once it occurs is insensitive to the seed. We also show that our approach can be successfully adapted into weighted networks.

010       iSIRA: Integrated Shift-Invert Residual Arnoldi Method for Graph   Laplacian Matrices from Big Data
021       The eigenvalue problem of a graph Laplacian matrix $L$ arising from a simple, connected and undirected graph has been given more attention due to its extensive applications, such as spectral clustering, community detection, complex network, image processing and so on. 
020       The associated graph Laplacian matrix is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and is usually large and sparse. Computing some smallest positive eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors is often of interest. <br />However, the singularity of $L$ makes the classical eigensolvers inefficient since we need to factorize $L$ for the purpose of solving large and sparse linear systems exactly. The next difficulty is that it is usually time consuming or even unavailable to factorize a large and sparse matrix arising from real network problems from big data such as social media transactional databases, and sensor systems because there is in general not only local connections. <br />In this paper, we propose an eignsolver based on the inexact residual Arnoldi method together with an implicit remedy of the singularity and an effective deflation for convergent eigenvalues. Numerical experiments reveal that the integrated eigensolver outperforms the classical Arnoldi/Lanczos method for computing some smallest positive eigeninformation provided the LU factorization is not available.

010       Robustness of synchrony in complex networks and generalized Kirchhoff   indices
021       In network theory, a question of prime importance is how to assess network vulnerability in a fast and reliable manner. 
020       With this issue in mind, we investigate the response to parameter changes of coupled dynamical systems on complex networks. We find that for specific, non-averaged perturbations, the response of synchronous states critically depends on the overlap between the perturbation vector and the eigenmodes of the stability matrix of the unperturbed dynamics. Once averaged over properly defined ensembles of such perturbations, the response is given by new graph topological indices, which we introduce as generalized Kirchhoff indices. These findings allow for a fast and reliable method for assessing the specific or average vulnerability of a network against changing operational conditions, faults or external attacks.

010       Communication-free Massively Distributed Graph Generation
021       Analyzing massive complex networks yields promising insights about our everyday lives. 
020       Building scalable algorithms to do that is a challenging task that requires a careful analysis and extensive evaluation. However, engineering such algorithms is often hindered by the scarcity of publicly available datasets. Network generators serve as a tool to alleviate this problem by providing synthetic instances with controllable parameters. However, many network generators fail to provide instances on a massive scale due to their sequential nature or resource constraints. Additionally, truly scalable network generators are few and often limited in their realism. In this work, we present novel generators for a variety of network models commonly found in practice. By making use of pseudorandomization and divide-and-conquer schemes, our generators follow a communication-free paradigm, i.e. they require no communication. The resulting generators are often embarrassingly parallel and have a near optimal scaling behavior. Overall, we are able to generate instances of up to $2^{43}$ vertices and $2^{47}$ edges in less than 22 minutes on 32768 processors. Therefore, our generators allow new graph families to be used on an unprecedented scale.

010       Locally Optimal Control of Complex Networks
021       It has recently been shown that the minimum energy solution of the control problem for a linear system produces a control trajectory that is nonlocal. 
020       An issue then arises when the dynamics represents a linearization of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the system where the linearization is only valid in a local region of the state space. Here we provide a solution to the problem of optimally controlling a linearized system by deriving a time-varying set that represents all possible control trajectories parameterized by time and energy. As long as the control action terminus is defined within this set, the control trajectory is guaranteed to be local. If the desired terminus of the control action is far from the initial state, a series of local control actions can be performed in series, re-linearizing the dynamics at each new position.

We find that synchronization can be achieved more quickly than the routine rhythm. This finding refines our understanding of the abundant ultrafast synchronization phenomena observed in nature, and it enables the efficient design of self-aligned robots.

010       Chimera states in brain networks: empirical neural vs. modular fractal   connectivity
021       Complex spatiotemporal patterns, called chimera states, consist of coexisting coherent and incoherent domains and can be observed in networks of coupled oscillators. 
020       The interplay of synchrony and asynchrony in complex brain networks is an important aspect in studies of both brain function and disease. We analyse the collective dynamics of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons in complex networks motivated by its potential application to epileptology and epilepsy surgery. We compare two topologies: an empirical structural neural connectivity derived from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and a mathematically constructed network with modular fractal connectivity. We analyse the properties of chimeras and partially synchronized states, and obtain regions of their stability in the parameter planes. Furthermore, we qualitatively simulate the dynamics of epileptic seizures and study the influence of the removal of nodes on the network synchronizability, which can be useful for applications to epileptic surgery.

010       The Rich get Richer and the Fit get Richer Phenomena in Temporal Complex   Networks in the Strategic Management Scientific Community
021       The aim of this paper is to determine the general preferential attachment function and author fitness, which describe the rich get richer and fit get richer phenomena, in the co-authorship and citation networks of the strategic management scientific community. 
020       This has been done by means of the PAFit method using the community's flagship journal, namely Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest the co-authorship and citation temporal networks are governed by both the fit get richer and the rich get richer processes. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-author network is 0.3 while it is 0.29 in the citation network, which suggests the rich get richer phenomenon is similarly weak in both networks. On the other hand, the distributions of author fitness in both networks have long right tail, which implies that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author plays a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Furthermore, author fitness in both co-authorship and citation networks are found to be consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community.

010       Asynchronous ADMM for Distributed Non-Convex Optimization in Power   Systems
021       Large scale, non-convex optimization problems arising in many complex networks such as the power system call for efficient and scalable distributed optimization algorithms. 
020       Existing distributed methods are usually iterative and require synchronization of all workers at each iteration, which is hard to scale and could result in the under-utilization of computation resources due to the heterogeneity of the subproblems. To address those limitations of synchronous schemes, this paper proposes an asynchronous distributed optimization method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for non-convex optimization. The proposed method only requires local communications and allows each worker to perform local updates with information from a subset of but not all neighbors. We provide sufficient conditions on the problem formulation, the choice of algorithm parameter and network delay, and show that under those mild conditions, the proposed asynchronous ADMM method asymptotically converges to the KKT point of the non-convex problem. We validate the effectiveness of asynchronous ADMM by applying it to the Optimal Power Flow problem in multiple power systems and show that the convergence of the proposed asynchronous scheme could be faster than its synchronous counterpart in large-scale applications.

010       Feature learning in feature-sample networks using multi-objective   optimization
021       Data and knowledge representation are fundamental concepts in machine learning. 
020       The quality of the representation impacts the performance of the learning model directly. Feature learning transforms or enhances raw data to structures that are effectively exploited by those models. In recent years, several works have been using complex networks for data representation and analysis. However, no feature learning method has been proposed for such category of techniques. Here, we present an unsupervised feature learning mechanism that works on datasets with binary features. First, the dataset is mapped into a feature--sample network. Then, a multi-objective optimization process selects a set of new vertices to produce an enhanced version of the network. The new features depend on a nonlinear function of a combination of preexisting features. Effectively, the process projects the input data into a higher-dimensional space. To solve the optimization problem, we design two metaheuristics based on the lexicographic genetic algorithm and the improved strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2). We show that the enhanced network contains more information and can be exploited to improve the performance of machine learning methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each optimization strategy are discussed.

010       Erratum: Link prediction in drug-target interactions network using   similarity indices
021       Background: In silico drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction plays an integral role in drug repositioning: the discovery of new uses for existing drugs. 
020       One popular method of drug repositioning is network-based DTI prediction, which uses complex network theory to predict DTIs from a drug-target network. Currently, most network-based DTI prediction is based on machine learning methods such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) or Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods require additional information about the characteristics of drugs, targets and DTIs, such as chemical structure, genome sequence, binding types, causes of interactions, etc., and do not perform satisfactorily when such information is unavailable. We propose a new, alternative method for DTI prediction that makes use of only network topology information attempting to solve this problem. <br />Results: We compare our method for DTI prediction against the well-known RBM approach. We show that when applied to the MATADOR database, our approach based on node neighborhoods yield higher precision for high-ranking predictions than RBM when no information regarding DTI types is available. <br />Conclusion: This demonstrates that approaches purely based on network topology provide a more suitable approach to DTI prediction in the many real-life situations where little or no prior knowledge is available about the characteristics of drugs, targets, or their interactions.

021       In living cells, chemical reactions form a complex network. 
020       Complicated dynamics arising from such networks are the origins of biological functions. We propose a novel mathematical method to analyze bifurcation behaviors of a reaction system from the network structure alone. The whole network is decomposed into subnetworks based on "buffering structures". For each subnetwork, the bifurcation condition is studied independently, and the parameters that can induce bifurcations and the chemicals that can exhibit bifurcations are determined. We demonstrate our theory using hypothetical and real networks.

010       Competition and Complexity in Amphiphilic Polymer Morphology
021       We analyze the competitive evolution of codimension one and two morphologies within the $H^{-1}$ gradient flow of the strong Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard equation. 
020       On a slow time scale a sharp hypersurface reduction yields a degenerate Mullins-Sekerka evolution for both codimension one and two hypersurfaces, leading to a geometric flow that depends locally on curvatures couples to the dynamic value of the spatially constant far-field chemical potential. Both codimension one and two morphologies admit two classes of bifurcations, one leads to pearling, a short-wavelength in-plane modulation of interfacial width, the other flips motion by curvature to the locally-ill posed motion against curvature, which leads to fingering instabilities. We present a bifurcation diagram for the morphological competition, and compare our results quantitatively to simulations of the full system and qualitatively to simulations of self-consistent mean field models and laboratory experiments; illuminating the role of the pearling bifurcation in the development of complex network morphologies.

010       Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in   Next-Generation Wireless Networks
021       The next-generation wireless networks are evolving into very complex systems because of the very diversified service requirements, heterogeneity in applications, devices, and networks. 
020       The mobile network operators (MNOs) need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks in terms of operation and optimization in a cost-effective way. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self- adaptive and predictive networking is much needed. The MNOs have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data greatly helps in making the network smart, intelligent and facilitates cost-effective operation and optimization. In view of this, we consider a data-driven next-generation wireless network model, where the MNOs employ advanced data analytics for their networks. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics and the role of machine learning, artificial intelligence in making the network intelligent in terms of being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are presented with respect to data analytics. The paper is concluded with a discussion of challenges and benefits of adopting big data analytics and artificial intelligence in the next-generation communication system.

010       Complex network analysis of brain functional connectivity under a   multi-step cognitive task
021       Functional brain network has been widely studied to understand the relationship between brain organization and behavior. 
020       In this paper, we aim to explore the functional connectivity of brain network under a \emph{multi-step} cognitive task involving with consecutive behaviors, and further understand the effect of behaviors on the brain organization. The functional brain networks are constructed base on a high spatial and temporal resolution fMRI dataset and analyzed via complex network based approach. We find that at voxel level the functional brain network shows robust small-worldness and scale-free characteristics, while its assortativity and rich-club organization are slightly restricted to order of behaviors performed. More interestingly, the functional connectivity of brain network in activated ROIs strongly correlates with behaviors and behaves obvious differences restricted to order of behaviors performed. These empirical results suggest that the brain organization has the generic properties of small-worldness and scale-free characteristics, and its diverse function connectivity emerging from activated ROIs is strongly driven by these behavioral activities via the plasticity of brain.

010       Link equations for discrete-time epidemic processes in complex network
021       Epidemic spreading in complex networks has been intensely studied because of its practical implications. 
020       Predicting epidemic spreading is essential to perform containment campaigns. The vast majority of the literature has concentrate the efforts on determining the state of the nodes according to the epidemics, however the "states of the links" has received little attention. The state of links inform about the probability of spreading the disease from infected to susceptible individuals. These states depend on the full structure of the network, and its determination is not straightforward from the knowledge of nodes' states. In particular, we wonder about its computation in discrete-time epidemics, which is the approach used in basically all large-scale simulation of epidemics at the world-scale. Here, we confront this challenge and propose a set of discrete-time governing equations that can be closed and analyzed, assessing the contribution of links to spreading processes in complex networks. We validate our approach in synthetic and real networks, obtaining a better determination of critical thresholds. Moreover, our approach allows new schemes for the contention of epidemics based on link deactivation that outperform previous approaches.

010       JASPER: Joint Optimization of Scaling, Placement, and Routing of Virtual   Network Services
021       To adapt to continuously changing workloads in networks, components of the running network services may need to be replicated (scaling the network service) and allocated to physical resources (placement) dynamically, also necessitating dynamic re-routing of flows between service components. 
020       In this paper, we propose JASPER, a fully automated approach to jointly optimizing scaling, placement, and routing for complex network services, consisting of multiple (virtualized) components. JASPER handles multiple network services that share the same substrate network; services can be dynamically added or removed and dynamic workload changes are handled. Our approach lets service designers specify their services on a high level of abstraction using service templates. From the service templates and a description of the substrate network, JASPER automatically makes scaling, placement and routing decisions, enabling quick reaction to changes. We formalize the problem, analyze its complexity, and develop two algorithms to solve it. Extensive empirical results show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

010       A comprehensive stochastic computational model of HIV infection from DNA   integration to viral burst
021       Multiple mechanisms in the HIV lifecycle play a role in its ability to evade therapy and become a chronic, difficult-to-treat infection. 
020       Within its major cellular target, the activated T cell, many steps occur between viral entry and viral burst, including reverse transcription of viral RNA, integration of the viral DNA in the host genome, viral transcription, splicing, translation, host and viral regulation, and viral packaging. These steps exploit complex networks of macromolecular interactions that exhibit various forms of stochastic behavior. While each of the steps of HIV infection have been individually studied extensively, the combinatorial contribution of rare events in each of the steps, and how series of these rare events lead to different infection phenotypes, are not well understood. The complexity of these processes render experimental study challenging. Therefore, we have built a comprehensive computational model of this large system, by collating the community's knowledge of the infection process. It is a stochastic model where rates of different events in the system are represented as probabilities of the event occurring in a timestep of the simulation. This model enables an understanding of the noise and variation in the system. The model also facilitates a dissected understanding of each small part of the large complex system, and its impact on the overall system dynamics.

010       Statistical Evaluation of Spectral Methods for Anomaly Detection in   Networks
021       Monitoring of networks for anomaly detection has attracted a lot of attention in recent years especially with the rise of connected devices and social networks. 
020       This is of importance as anomaly detection could span a wide range of application, from detecting terrorist cells in counter-terrorism efforts to phishing attacks in social network circles. For this reason, numerous techniques for anomaly detection have been introduced. However, application of these techniques to more complex network models is hindered by various challenges such as the size of the network being investigated, how much apriori information is needed, the size of the anomalous graph, among others. A recent technique introduced by Miller et al, which relies on a spectral framework for anomaly detection, has the potential to address many of these challenges. In their discussion of the spectral framework, three algorithms were proposed that relied on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the residual matrix of a binary network. The authors demonstrated the ability to detect anomalous subgraphs that were less than 1\% of the network size. However, to date, there is little work that has been done to evaluate the statistical performance of these algorithms. This study investigates the statistical properties of the spectral methods, specifically the Chi-square and $L_1$ norm algorithm proposed by Miller. We will analyze the performance of the algorithm using simulated networks and also extend the method's application to count networks. Finally we will make some methodological improvements and recommendations to both algorithms.

010       Analysis of group evolution prediction in complex networks
021       In a world, in which the acceptance and the social community membership is highly desired, the ability to predict social group evolution appears to be a fascinating research task, yet very complex. 
020       Therefore, the problem decomposition has been performed, and a new, adaptable and generic method for group evolution prediction in social networks (called GEP) is proposed in this paper. The work also contains extensive evaluation of the GEP method for many real-world social networks, including (1) analysis of numerous parameters (time window type and size, community detection method, evolution chain length, classifier used, etc.), (2) comparative analysis against other existing methods, (3) adaptation of the transfer learning concept to group evolution prediction, (4) enhancing the classification model with a more appropriate training set, and (5) prediction of more distant and multiple following future events. Additionally, many new predictive features reflecting the community state at a given time are proposed as well as rankings of the features most valuable for the classification process are provided. Moreover, the work identified a number of problems of existing methods for evolution prediction. The most severe are methodological issues, a narrow application area, insufficient validation, superficial descriptions of the methods and conducted experiments, as well as lack or unreliable comparisons with other methods.

010       Entrograms and coarse graining of dynamics on complex networks
021       Using an information theoretic point of view, we investigate how a dynamics acting on a network can be coarse grained through the use of graph partitions. 
020       Specifically, we are interested in how aggregating the state space of a Markov process according to a partition impacts on the thus obtained lower-dimensional dynamics. We highlight that for a dynamics on a particular graph there may be multiple coarse grained descriptions that capture different, incomparable features of the original process. For instance, a coarse graining induced by one partition may be commensurate with a time-scale separation in the dynamics, while another coarse graining may correspond to a different lower-dimensional dynamics that preserves the Markov property of the original process. Taking inspiration from the literature of Computational Mechanics, we find that a convenient tool to summarise and visualise such dynamical properties of a coarse grained model (partition) is the entrogram. The entrogram gathers certain information-theoretic measures, which quantify how information flows across time steps. These information theoretic quantities include the entropy rate, as well as a measure for the memory contained in the process, i.e., how well the dynamics can be approximated by a first order Markov process. We use the entrogram to investigate how specific macro-scale connection patterns in the state-space transition graph of the original dynamics result in desirable properties of coarse grained descriptions. We thereby provide a fresh perspective on the interplay between structure and dynamics in networks, and the process of partitioning from an information theoretic perspective. We focus on networks that may be approximated by both a core-periphery or a clustered organization, and highlight that each of these coarse grained descriptions can capture different aspects of a Markov process acting on the network.

010       Emergent explosive synchronization in adaptive complex networks
021       Adaptation plays a fundamental role in shaping the structure of a complex network and improving its functional fitting. 
020       Even when increasing the level of synchronization in a biological system is considered as the main driving force for adaptation, there is evidence of negative effects induced by excessive synchronization. This indicates that coherence alone can not be enough to explain all the structural features observed in many real-world networks. In this work, we propose an adaptive network model where the dynamical evolution of the node states towards synchronization is coupled with an evolution of the link weights based on an anti-Hebbian adaptive rule, which accounts for the presence of inhibitory effects in the system. We found that the emergent networks spontaneously develop the structural conditions to sustain explosive synchronization. Our results can enlighten the shaping mechanisms at the heart of the structural and dynamical organization of some relevant biological systems, namely brain networks, for which the emergence of explosive synchronization has been observed.

021       Measuring functional connectivity from fMRI is important in understanding processing in cortical networks. 
020       However, because brain's connection pattern is complex, currently used methods are prone to produce false connections. We introduce here a new method that uses derivative for estimating functional connectivity. Using simulations, we benchmarked our method with other commonly used methods. Our method achieves better results in complex network simulations. This new method provides an alternative way to estimate functional connectivity.

010       Visibility graph analysis of wall turbulence time-series
021       The spatio-temporal features of the velocity field of a fully-developed turbulent channel flow are investigated through the natural visibility graph (NVG) method, which is able to fully map the intrinsic structure of the time-series into complex networks. 
020       Time-series of the three velocity components, (u,v,w), are analyzed at fixed grid-points of the whole three-dimensional domain. Each time-series was mapped into a network by means of the NVG algorithm, so that each network corresponds to a grid-point of the simulation. The degree centrality, the transitivity and the here proposed mean link-length were evaluated as indicators of the global visibility, inter-visibility, and mean temporal distance among nodes, respectively. The metrics were averaged along the directions of homogeneity (x, z) of the flow, so they only depend on the wall-normal coordinate, y^+. The visibility-based networks, inheriting the flow field features, unveil key temporal properties of the turbulent time-series and their changes moving along y^+. Although intrinsically simple to be implemented, the visibility graph-based approach offers a promising and effective support to the classical methods for accurate time-series analyses of inhomogeneous turbulent flows.

010       The impact of a network split on cascading failure processes
021       Cascading failure models are typically used to capture the phenomenon where failures possibly trigger further failures in succession, causing knock-on effects. 
020       In many networks this ultimately leads to a disintegrated network where the failure propagation continues independently across the various components. In order to gain insight in the impact of network splitting on cascading failure processes, we extend a well-established cascading failure model for which the number of failures obeys a power-law distribution. We assume that a single line failure immediately splits the network in two components, and examine its effect on the power-law exponent. The results provide valuable qualitative insights that are crucial first steps towards understanding more complex network splitting scenarios.

010       Quantum transport senses community structure in networks
021       Quantum time evolution exhibits rich physics, attributable to the interplay between the density and phase of a wave function. 
020       However, unlike classical heat diffusion, the wave nature of quantum mechanics has not yet been extensively explored in modern data analysis. We propose that the Laplace transform of quantum transport (QT) can be used to construct an ensemble of maps from a given complex network to a circle $S^1$, such that closely-related nodes on the network are grouped into sharply concentrated clusters on $S^1$. The resulting QT clustering (QTC) algorithm is as powerful as the state-of-the-art spectral clustering in discerning complex geometric patterns and more robust when clusters show strong density variations or heterogeneity in size. The observed phenomenon of QTC can be interpreted as a collective behavior of the microscopic nodes that evolve as macroscopic cluster orbitals in an effective tight-binding model recapitulating the network. Python source code implementing the algorithm and examples are available at <a href="https://github.com/jssong-lab/QTC.">this https URL</a>

We perform several numerical simulations to further check the accuracy of our theoretical results. Finally we present an application of the directed limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph for measuring real-value time series irreversibility, and an application of the image limited penetrable horizontal visibility graph that discriminates noise from chaos. The empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

Here we introduce the concept of (geo)graphs: graphs in which the nodes have a known geographical location and the edges have spatial dependence. We present case studies and two open source softwares (GIS4GRAPH and GeoCNet) that indicate how to retrieve networks from GIS data and how to represent networks over GIS data by using (geo)graphs.

010       Network Geometry and Complexity
021       Recently higher order networks describing the interactions between two or more nodes are attracting large attention. 
020       Most notably higher order networks include simplicial complexes formed not only by nodes and links but also by triangles, tetrahedra, etc. glued along their faces. Simplicial complexes and in general higher order networks are able to characterize data as different as functional brain networks or collaboration networks beyond the framework of pairwise interactions. Interestingly higher order networks have a natural geometric interpretation and therefore constitute the natural way to explore the discrete network geometry of complex networks. Here we investigate the rich interplay between emergent network geometry of higher order networks and their complexity in the framework of a non-equilibrium model called Network Geometry with Flavor. This model originally proposed for capturing the evolution of simplicial complexes is here extended in order to capture higher order networks formed not only by simplices but by any type of regular polytope. We reveal the interplay between complexity and geometry of the higher-order networks by studying the emergent community structure and the dependence of the degree distribution on the dimension and the nature of the regular polytope forming the building blocks of the networked structure. Additionally we discuss the underlying hyperbolic nature of the emergent geometry and we relate the spectral dimension of the higher-order network to the dimension and nature of its building blocks.

020       A computational investigation to evaluate the relative binding ability of a group of anti- Angiopoietin-2 aptamers is proposed and tested against data already available in the literature. Results: The procedure consists of three steps: a. the production of a large set of conformations for each candidate aptamer; b. the rigid docking upon the receptor; c. the topological and electrical characterization of the products. Steps a and b allow a global binding score of the ligand-receptor complexes, based on the distribution of the "effective affinity", i.e. the sum of the conformational and the docking energies. Step c. employes a complex network approach (Proteotronics) to characterize the electrical properties of the aptamers and the complexes. Finally, a comparison of the theoretical results with the measurements obtained for the same aptamers in experiments on the SPR biosensor is performed, revealing a good agreement.

010       Topology and Dynamics in Complex Networks: The Role of Edge Reciprocity
021       A key issue in complex systems regards the relationship between topology and dynamics. 
020       In this work, we use a recently introduced network property known as steering coefficient as a means to approach this issue with respect to different directed complex network systems under varying dynamics. Theoretical and real-world networks are considered, and the influences of reciprocity and average degree on the steering coefficient are quantified. A number of interesting results are reported that can assist the design of complex systems exhibiting larger or smaller relationships between topology and dynamics.

010       Geometric robustness of deep networks: analysis and improvement
021       Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to arbitrary geometric transformations. 
020       However, there is no systematic method to measure the invariance properties of deep networks to such transformations. We propose ManiFool as a simple yet scalable algorithm to measure the invariance of deep networks. In particular, our algorithm measures the robustness of deep networks to geometric transformations in a worst-case regime as they can be problematic for sensitive applications. Our extensive experimental results show that ManiFool can be used to measure the invariance of fairly complex networks on high dimensional datasets and these values can be used for analyzing the reasons for it. Furthermore, we build on Manifool to propose a new adversarial training scheme and we show its effectiveness on improving the invariance properties of deep neural networks.

010       BL-MNE: Emerging Heterogeneous Social Network Embedding through Broad   Learning with Aligned Autoencoder
021       Network embedding aims at projecting the network data into a low-dimensional feature space, where the nodes are represented as a unique feature vector and network structure can be effectively preserved. 
020       In recent years, more and more online application service sites can be represented as massive and complex networks, which are extremely challenging for traditional machine learning algorithms to deal with. Effective embedding of the complex network data into low-dimension feature representation can both save data storage space and enable traditional machine learning algorithms applicable to handle the network data. Network embedding performance will degrade greatly if the networks are of a sparse structure, like the emerging networks with few connections. In this paper, we propose to learn the embedding representation for a target emerging network based on the broad learning setting, where the emerging network is aligned with other external mature networks at the same time. To solve the problem, a new embedding framework, namely "Deep alIgned autoencoder based eMbEdding" (DIME), is introduced in this paper. DIME handles the diverse link and attribute in a unified analytic based on broad learning, and introduces the multiple aligned attributed heterogeneous social network concept to model the network structure. A set of meta paths are introduced in the paper, which define various kinds of connections among users via the heterogeneous link and attribute information. The closeness among users in the networks are defined as the meta proximity scores, which will be fed into DIME to learn the embedding vectors of users in the emerging network. Extensive experiments have been done on real-world aligned social networks, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of DIME in learning the emerging network embedding vectors.

010       Community detection algorithm evaluation with ground-truth data
021       Community structure is of paramount importance for the understanding of complex networks. 
020       Consequently, there is a tremendous effort in order to develop efficient community detection algorithms. Unfortunately, the issue of a fair assessment of these algorithms is a thriving open question. If the ground-truth community structure is available, various clustering-based metrics are used in order to compare it versus the one discovered by these algorithms. However, these metrics defined at the node level are fairly insensitive to the variation of the overall community structure. To overcome these limitations, we propose to exploit the topological features of the 'community graphs' (where the nodes are the communities and the links represent their interactions) in order to evaluate the algorithms. To illustrate our methodology, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of overlapping community detection algorithms using a set of real-world networks with known a priori community structure. Results provide a better perception of their relative performance as compared to classical metrics. Moreover, they show that more emphasis should be put on the topology of the community structure. We also investigate the relationship between the topological properties of the community structure and the alternative evaluation measures (quality metrics and clustering metrics). It appears clearly that they present different views of the community structure and that they must be combined in order to evaluate the effectiveness of community detection algorithms.

020       The key features are that the user enters the derivative symbolically and it is just-in-time-compiled, allowing the user to efficiently integrate differential equations from a higher-level interpreted language. The presented modules are particularly suited for large systems of differential equations such as used to describe dynamics on complex networks. Through the selected method of input, the presented modules also allow to almost completely automatize the process of estimating regular as well as transversal Lyapunov exponents for ordinary and delay differential equations.

010       The Influences of Edge Asymmetry on Network Robustness
021       Asymmetry of in/out-degree distribution is a widespread phenomenon in real-world complex networks. 
020       This paper put forward the concept of Edge Asymmetry(EA) to quantify this feature. We designed an EA-based strategy to attack six kinds of real-world networks and found that it was able to achieve the effect as well as edge betweenness-based(EB) and better than edge degree-based(ED) and random attack strategies. In simulation, we found that the greater the network asymmetry the better the EA-based attack strategy performed. By definition, the computational complexity of EA was much lower than that of EB. Therefore, EA-based attack strategies were superior in efficiency. We verified the effect of the EA-based attack strategy with four groups of large-scale networks.

010       Modeling the Multiple Sclerosis Brain Disease Using Agents: What Works   and What Doesn&#x27;t?
021       The human brain is one of the most complex living structures in the known Universe. 
020       It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic complexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure and functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on modeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies have employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation models as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been developed using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of them have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem because without due process, developed models can miss out on important requirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from multiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides concepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software engineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ the use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple Sclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the models, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to develop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The key objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and effectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain structure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration that AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living complex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.

010       Network Coding Based Evolutionary Network Formation for Dynamic Wireless   Networks
021       In this paper, we aim to find a robust network formation strategy that can adaptively evolve the network topology against network dynamics in a distributed manner. 
020       We consider a network coding deployed wireless ad hoc network where source nodes are connected to terminal nodes with the help of intermediate nodes. We show that mixing operations in network coding can induce packet anonymity that allows the inter-connections in a network to be decoupled. This enables each intermediate node to consider complex network inter-connections as a node-environment interaction such that the Markov decision process (MDP) can be employed at each intermediate node. The optimal policy that can be obtained by solving the MDP provides each node with optimal amount of changes in transmission range given network dynamics (e.g., the number of nodes in the range and channel condition). Hence, the network can be adaptively and optimally evolved by responding to the network dynamics. The proposed strategy is used to maximize long-term utility, which is achieved by considering both current network conditions and future network dynamics. We define the utility of an action to include network throughput gain and the cost of transmission power. We show that the resulting network of the proposed strategy eventually converges to stationary networks, which maintain the states of the nodes. Moreover, we propose to determine initial transmission ranges and initial network topology that can expedite the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Our simulation results confirm that the proposed strategy builds a network which adaptively changes its topology in the presence of network dynamics. Moreover, the proposed strategy outperforms existing strategies in terms of system goodput and successful connectivity ratio.

010       A general formulation of long-range degree correlations in complex   networks
021       We provide a general framework for analyzing degree correlations between nodes separated by more than one step (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in complex networks. 
020       One probability and four conditional probabilities are introduced to fully describe long-range degree correlations with respect to $k$ and $k'$ of two nodes and shortest path length $l$ between them. We present general relations among these probabilities and clarify the relevance to nearest-neighbor degree correlations. Unlike nearest-neighbor correlations, some of these probabilities are meaningful only in finite-size networks. Furthermore, as a baseline to determine the existence or nonexistence of long-range degree correlations in a network, the functional forms of these probabilities for networks without any long-range degree correlations are analytically evaluated within a mean-field approximation. The validity of our argument is demonstrated by applying it to real-world networks.

By iterating this local connectivity we sweep the whole image and infer the global topology of the filamentary network, inspired by a human delineating a complex network with the tip of their finger. <br />We perform an extensive and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation on two tasks: retinal veins and arteries topology extraction and road network estimation. In both cases, represented by two publicly available datasets (DRIVE and Massachusetts Roads), we show superior performance to very strong baselines.

010       Quantum Clique Gossiping
021       This paper establishes a framework for the acceleration of quantum gossip algorithms by introducing local clique operations to networks of interconnected qubits. 
020       Cliques are local structures in complex networks being complete subgraphs. Based on cyclic permutations, clique gossiping leads to collective multi-party qubit interactions. This type of algorithm can be physically realized by a series of local environments using coherent methods. First of all, we show that at reduced states, these cliques have the same acceleration effects as their roles in accelerating classical gossip algorithms, which can even make possible finite-time convergence for suitable network structures. Next, for randomized selection of cliques where node updates enjoy a more self-organized and scalable sequencing, we show that the rate of convergence is precisely improved by $\mathcal{O}(k/n)$ at the reduced states, where $k$ is the size of the cliques and $n$ is the number of qubits in the network. The rate of convergence at the coherent states of the overall quantum network is proven to be decided by the spectrum of a mean-square error evolution matrix. Explicit calculation of such matrix is rather challenging, nonetheless, the effect of cliques on the coherent states' dynamics is illustrated via numerical examples. Interestingly, the use of larger quantum cliques does not necessarily increase the speed of the network density aggregation, suggesting quantum network dynamics is not entirely decided by its classical topology.

010       Linear and nonlinear market correlations: characterizing financial   crises and portfolio optimization
021       Pearson correlation and mutual information based complex networks of the day-to-day returns of US S&amp;P500 stocks between 1985 and 2015 have been constructed in order to investigate the mutual dependencies of the stocks and their nature. 
020       We show that both networks detect qualitative differences especially during (recent) turbulent market periods thus indicating strongly fluctuating interconnections between the stocks of different companies in changing economic environments. A measure for the strength of nonlinear dependencies is derived using surrogate data and leads to interesting observations during periods of financial market crises. In contrast to the expectation that dependencies reduce mainly to linear correlations during crises we show that (at least in the 2008 crisis) nonlinear effects are significantly increasing. It turns out that the concept of centrality within a network could potentially be used as some kind of an early warning indicator for abnormal market behavior as we demonstrate with the example of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis. Finally, we apply a Markowitz mean variance portfolio optimization and integrate the measure of nonlinear dependencies to scale the investment exposure. This leads to significant outperformance as compared to a fully invested portfolio.

010       Experiments with arbitrary networks in time-multiplexed delay systems
021       We report a new experimental approach using an optoelectronic feedback loop to investigate the dynamics of oscillators coupled on large complex networks with arbitrary topology. 
020       Our implementation is based on a single optoelectronic feedback loop with time delays. We use the space-time interpretation of systems with time delay to create large networks of coupled maps. Others have performed similar experiments using high-pass filters to implement the coupling; this restricts the network topology to the coupling of only a few nearest neighbors. In our experiment, the time delays and coupling are implemented on a field-programmable gate array, allowing the creation of networks with arbitrary coupling topology. This system has many advantages: the network nodes are truly identical, the network is easily reconfigurable, and the network dynamics occur at high speeds. We use this system to study cluster synchronization and chimera states in both small and large networks of different topologies.

010       Comparing Three Notions of Discrete Ricci Curvature on Biological   Networks
021       In the present work, we study the properties of biological networks by applying analogous notions of fundamental concepts in Riemannian geometry and optimal mass transport to discrete networks described by weighted graphs. 
020       Specifically, we employ possible generalizations of the notion of Ricci curvature on Riemannian manifold to discrete spaces in order to infer certain robustness properties of the networks of interest. We compare three possible discrete notions of Ricci curvature (Olivier Ricci curvature, Bakry-\'Emery Ricci curvature, and Forman Ricci curvature) on some model and biological networks. While the exact relationship of each of the three definitions of curvature to one another is still not known, they do yield similar results on our biological networks of interest. These notions are initially defined on positively weighted graphs; however, Forman-Ricci curvature can also be defined on directed positively weighted networks. We will generalize this notion of directed Forman Ricci curvature on the network to a form that also considers the signs of the directions (e. g., activator and repressor in transcription networks). We call this notion the \emph{signed-control Ricci curvature}. Given real biological networks are almost always directed and possess positive and negative controls, the notion of signed-control curvature can elucidate the network-based study of these complex networks. Finally, we compare the results of these notions of Ricci curvature on networks to some known network measures, namely, betweenness centrality and clustering coefficients on graphs.

010       Decoupling approximation robustly reconstructs directed dynamical   networks
021       Methods for reconstructing the topology of complex networks from time-resolved observations of node dynamics are gaining relevance across scientific disciplines. 
020       Of biggest practical interest are methods that make no assumptions about properties of the dynamics, and can cope with noisy, short and incomplete trajectories. Ideal reconstruction in such scenario requires and exhaustive approach of simulating the dynamics for all possible network configurations and matching the simulated against the actual trajectories, which of course is computationally too costly for any realistic application. Relying on insights from equation discovery and machine learning, we here introduce \textit{decoupling approximation} of dynamical networks and propose a new reconstruction method based on it. Decoupling approximation consists of matching the simulated against the actual trajectories for each node individually rather than for the entire network at once. Despite drastic reduction of the computational cost that this approximation entails, we find our method's performance to be very close to that of the ideal method. In particular, we not only make no assumptions about properties of the trajectories, but provide strong evidence that our methods' performance is largely independent of the dynamical regime at hand. Of crucial relevance for practical applications, we also find our method to be extremely robust to both length and resolution of the trajectories and relatively insensitive to noise.

010       Random walks with long-range steps generated by functions of Laplacian   matrices
021       In this paper, we explore different Markovian random walk strategies on networks with transition probabilities between nodes defined in terms of functions of the Laplacian matrix. 
020       We generalize random walk strategies with local information in the Laplacian matrix, that describes the connections of a network, to a dynamics determined by functions of this matrix. The resulting processes is non-local allowing transitions of the random walker from one node to nodes beyond its nearest neighbors. <br />In the first part, we discuss spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix and a series of relations that are maintained by a particular type of functions that allow to define random walks on any type of undirected connected networks. Once described general properties, we explore characteristics of random walk strategies that emerge from particular cases with functions defined in terms of exponentials, logarithms and powers of the Laplacian as well as relations of these dynamics with non-local strategies like L\'evy flights and fractional transport. Finally, we analyze the global capacity of these random walk strategies to explore networks like lattices and trees and different types of random and complex networks.

010       Mean-field approach for frequency synchronization in complex networks of   two oscillator types
021       Oscillator networks with an asymmetric bipolar distribution of natural frequencies are used to describe stable operations in electrical transmission grids. 
020       We propose a mean-field model that captures the onset and form of frequency synchronization in such oscillator networks. The model takes into account a broad class of heterogeneous connection structures. It yields critical thresholds and a closed-form description of the synchronized state, identifying basic properties that synchronized regimes possess on all considered topologies. The framework also captures synchronized regimes with large phase differences that commonly appear just above the critical threshold. Additionally, two model quantities gauge the accuracy of mean-field assumptions.

010       Optimality Of Community Structure In Complex Networks
021       Community detection is one of the pivotal tools for discovering the structure of complex networks. 
020       Majority of community detection methods rely on optimization of certain quality functions characterizing the proposed community structure. Perhaps, the most commonly used of those quality functions is modularity. Many heuristics are claimed to be efficient in modularity maximization, which is usually justified in relative terms through comparison of their outcomes with those provided by other known algorithms. However as all the approaches are heuristics, while the complete brute-force is not feasible, there is no known way to understand if the obtained partitioning is really the optimal one. In this article we address the modularity maximization problem from the other side --- finding an upper-bound estimate for the possible modularity values within a given network, allowing to better evaluate suggested community structures. Moreover, in some cases when then upper bound estimate meets the actually obtained modularity score, it provides a proof that the suggested community structure is indeed the optimal one. We propose an efficient algorithm for building such an upper-bound estimate and illustrate its usage on the examples of well-known classical and synthetic networks, being able to prove the optimality of the existing partitioning for some of the networks including well-known Zachary's Karate Club.

010       Dynamic communicability and flow to describe complex network dynamics   with linear feedback
021       Graph theory has become a widely used toolbox to investigate complex networks estimated from real-life data. 
020       A specific direction of research has used collective dynamics obtained for propagation-like processes, such as oscillators and random walks, in order to characterize intricate topologies. However, the study of complex network dynamics lacks a dedicated theoretical framework. Here we derive a rigorous framework based on the network response (i.e,. the Green function) to study interactions between nodes across time -quantified by dynamic communicability- in a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which describes stable and non-conservative dynamics. Our framework also describes how the properties of external inputs contribute to the network activity, by defining the measure of flow. We illustrate the interplay between network connectivity and input properties with several classical network examples, such as the small-world ring network and the hierarchical network. Our theory defines a comprehensive framework to study and compare directed weighted networks, from pairwise interactions to global properties (e.g., small-worldness) and community detection.

010       Inferring hierarchical structure of spatial and generic complex networks   through a modeling framework
021       Our recent paper [Grauwin et al. 
020       Sci. Rep. 7 (2017)] demonstrates that community and hierarchical structure of the networks of human interactions largely determines the least and should be taken into account while modeling them. In the present proof-of-concept pre-print the opposite question is considered: could the hierarchical structure itself be inferred to be best aligned with the network model? The inference mechanism is provided for both - spatial networks as well as complex networks in general - through a model based on hierarchical and (if defined) geographical distances. The mechanism allows to discover hierarchical and community structure at any desired resolution in complex networks and in particular - the space-independent structure of the spatial networks. The approach is illustrated on the example of the interstate people migration network in USA.

010       Causal Decomposition in the Mutual Causation System
021       Inference of causality in time series has been principally based on the prediction paradigm. 
020       Nonetheless, the predictive causality approach may overlook the simultaneous and reciprocal nature of causal interactions observed in real world phenomena. Here, we present a causal decomposition approach that is not based on prediction, but based on the instantaneous phase dependency between the intrinsic components of a decomposed time series. The method involves two assumptions: (1) any cause effect relationship can be quantified with instantaneous phase dependency between the source and target decomposed as intrinsic components at specific time scale, and (2) the phase dynamics in the target originating from the source are separable from the target itself. Using empirical mode decomposition, we show that the causal interaction is encoded in instantaneous phase dependency at a specific time scale, and this phase dependency is diminished when the causal-related intrinsic component is removed from the effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generic applicability of our method to both stochastic and deterministic systems, and show the consistency of the causal decomposition method compared to existing methods, and finally uncover the key mode of causal interactions in both the modelled and actual predator prey system. We anticipate that this novel approach will assist with revealing causal interactions in complex networks not accounted for by current methods.

010       Comparative analysis of two discretizations of Ricci curvature for   complex networks
021       We have performed an empirical comparison of two distinct notions of discrete Ricci curvature for graphs or networks, namely, the Forman-Ricci curvature and Ollivier-Ricci curvature. 
020       Importantly, the two discretizations of the Ricci curvature, Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci, were developed based on different properties of the classical smooth notion, and thus, the two notions shed light on different aspects of network structure and behavior. Nevertheless, our extensive computational analysis in wide-range of both model and real-world networks shows that the two discretizations of Ricci curvature are statistically well correlated. Besides the potential theoretical implications of these observations, the close relationship between the two discretizations has practical implications whereby Forman-Ricci curvature can be employed in place of Ollivier-Ricci curvature for faster computation in larger networks whenever coarse analysis suffices.

010       Model-Based Clustering of Nonparametric Weighted Networks
021       Water pollution is a major global environmental problem, and it poses a great environmental risk to public health and biological diversity. 
020       This work is motivated by assessing the potential environmental threat of coal mining through increased sulfate concentrations in river networks, which do not belong to any simple parametric distribution. However, existing network models mainly focus on binary or discrete networks and weighted networks with known parametric weight distributions. We propose a principled nonparametric weighted network model based on exponential-family random graph models and local likelihood estimation and study its model-based clustering with application to large-scale water pollution network analysis. We do not require any parametric distribution assumption on network weights. The proposed method greatly extends the methodology and applicability of statistical network models. Furthermore, it is scalable to large and complex networks in large-scale environmental studies and geoscientific research. The power of our proposed methods is demonstrated in simulation studies.

010       A Compositional Coalgebraic Semantics of Strategic Games
021       We provide a compositional coalgebraic semantics for strategic games. 
020       In our framework, like in the semantics of functional programming languages, coalgebras represent the observable behaviour of systems derived from the behaviour of the parts over an unobservable state space. We use coalgebras to describe and program stage games, finitely and potentially infinitely repeated hierarchical or parallel games with imperfect and incomplete information based on deterministic, non-deterministic or probabilistic decisions of learning agents in possibly endogenous networks. Our framework is compositional in that arbitrarily complex network of games can be composed. The coalgebraic approach allows to represent self-referential or reflexive structures like institutional dynamics, strategic network formation from within the network, belief formation, learning agents or other self-referential phenomena that characterise complex social systems of cognitive agents. And finally our games represent directly runnable code in functional programming languages that can also be analysed by sophisticated verification and logical tools of software engineering.

010       Non-Markovianity over ensemble averages in quantum complex networks
021       We consider bosonic quantum complex networks as structured finite environments for a quantum harmonic oscillator and investigate the interplay between the network structure and its spectral density, excitation transport properties and non-Markovianity. 
020       After a review of the formalism used, we demonstrate how even small changes to the network structure can have a large impact on the transport of excitations. We then consider the non-Markovianity over ensemble averages of several different types of random networks of identical oscillators and uniform coupling strength. Our results show that increasing the number of interactions in the network tends to suppress the average non-Markovianity. This suggests that tree networks are the random networks optimizing this quantity.

010       Experimentally confirmed half-chaos removes the strong limitations in   modeling using dynamic complex networks
021       Current theory predicts that random autonomous systems can be either ordered or chaotic. 
020       By slightly changing the network parameters, a fast phase transition between chaos and order appears. However, modeled adapted systems are usually stable, but they have a large range of response to disturbances, and the estimated parameters are usually in chaotic regime, far from the narrow phase transition. I show that among the systems that are not fully random with parameters of the random chaotic system, a large third type: half-chaos exists, which simultaneously have small (ordered) and large (chaotic) reactions. Half-chaos allows to use "chaotic parameters" and get for most disturbances stable system, gives a base for identity of evolving object, simplifies definition of basic Darwinian mechanism and changes "lives on the edge of chaos" to "life evolves in the half-chaos of not fully random systems".

010       Quenched mean-field theory for the majority-vote model on complex   networks
021       The majority-vote (MV) model is one of the simplest nonequilibrium Ising-like model that exhibits a continuous order-disorder phase transition at a critical noise. 
020       In this paper, we present a quenched mean-field theory for the dynamics of the MV model on networks. We analytically derive the critical noise on arbitrary quenched unweighted networks, which is determined by the largest eigenvalue of a modified network adjacency matrix. By performing extensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic and real networks, we find that the performance of the quenched mean-field theory is superior to a heterogeneous mean-field theory proposed in a previous paper [Chen \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. E 91, 022816 (2015)], especially for directed networks.

010       Scale-free Loopy Structure is Resistant to Noise in Consensus Dynamics   in Complex Networks
021       The vast majority of real-world networks are scale-free, loopy, and sparse, with a power-law degree distribution and a constant average degree. 
020       In this paper, we study first-order consensus dynamics in binary scale-free networks, where vertices are subject to white noise. We focus on the coherence of networks characterized in terms of the $H_2$-norm, which quantifies how closely agents track the consensus value. We first provide a lower bound of coherence of a network in terms of its average degree, which is independent of the network order. We then study the coherence of some sparse, scale-free real-world networks, which approaches a constant. We also study numerically the coherence of Barab\'asi-Albert networks and high-dimensional random Apollonian networks, which also converges to a constant when the networks grow. Finally, based on the connection of coherence and the Kirchhoff index, we study analytically the coherence of two deterministically-growing sparse networks and obtain the exact expressions, which tend to small constants. Our results indicate that the effect of noise on the consensus dynamics in power-law networks is negligible. We argue that scale-free topology, together with loopy structure, is responsible for the strong robustness with respect to noisy consensus dynamics in power-law networks.

010       Approximations and Limit Theorems for Discrete-Time Occupancy Processes
021       We study deterministic and normal approximations for a class of discrete-time occupancy processes, namely, Markov chains with transition kernels of product Bernoulli form. 
020       This class encompasses numerous models which appear in the complex networks literature, including stochastic patch occupancy models in ecology, network models in epidemiology, and a variety of dynamic random graph models. Moment inequalities on the deviation from an analogous deterministic model are presented, alongside bounds on the rate of convergence in law to a normal approximation under the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov metrics, which are obtained using Stein's method. We are able to identify a subclass of weakly interacting processes that exhibit approximate Gaussian behaviour, and we develop a general strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for these processes. Applications to epidemic network models, metapopulation models, and convergence of dynamic random graphs, are discussed.

010       Inferring propagation paths for sparsely observed perturbations on   complex networks
021       In a complex system, perturbations propagate by following paths on the network of interactions among the system's units. 
020       In contrast to what happens with the spreading of epidemics, observations of general perturbations are often very sparse in time (there is a single observation of the perturbed system) and in "space" (only a few perturbed and unperturbed units are observed). A major challenge in many areas, from biology to the social sciences, is to infer the propagation paths from observations of the effects of perturbation under these sparsity conditions. We address this problem and show that it is possible to go beyond the usual approach of using the shortest paths connecting the known perturbed nodes. Specifically, we show that a simple and general probabilistic model, which we solved using belief propagation, provides fast and accurate estimates of the probabilities of nodes being perturbed.

010       An ALMA study of the Orion Integral Filament: I. Evidence for narrow   fibers in a massive cloud
021       Abridged. Are all filaments bundles of fibers? To address this question, we have investigated the gas organization within the paradigmatic Integral Shape Filament (ISF). 
020       We combined two new ALMA Cycle 3 mosaics with previous IRAM 30m observations to produce a high-dynamic range N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) emission map of the ISF tracing its high-density material and velocity structure down to scales of 0.009 pc. From the analysis of the gas kinematics, we identify a total of 55 dense fibers in the central region of the ISF. Independently of their location, these fibers are characterized by transonic internal motions, lengths of ~0.15 pc, and masses per-unit-length close to those expected in hydrostatic equilibrium. The ISF fibers are spatially organized forming a dense bundle with multiple hub-like associations likely shaped by the local gravitational potential. Within this complex network, the ISF fibers show a compact radial emission profile with a median FWHM of 0.035 pc systematically narrower than the previously proposed universal 0.1 pc filament width. Our ALMA observations reveal complex bundles of fibers in the ISF, suggesting strong similarities between the internal substructure of this massive filament and previously studied lower-mass objects. The fibers show identical dynamic properties in both low- and high-mass regions, and their widespread detection suggests a preferred organizational mechanism of gas in which the physical fiber dimensions (width and length) are self-regulated depending on their intrinsic gas density. Combined with previous works, we identify a systematic increase of the surface density of fibers as a function of the total mass per-unit-length in filamentary clouds. Based on this empirical correlation, we propose a unified star-formation scenario where the observed differences between low- and high-mass clouds emerge naturally from the initial concentration of fibers.

010       Impact of network randomness on multiple opinion dynamics
021       People often face the challenge of choosing among different options with similar attractiveness. 
020       To study the distribution of preferences that emerge in such situations, a useful approach is to simulate opinion dynamics on top of complex networks, composed by nodes (individuals) and their connections (edges), where the state of each node can be one amongst several opinions including the undecided state. We use two different dynamics rules: the one proposed by Travieso-Fontoura (TF) and the plurality rule (PR), which are paradigmatic of outflow and inflow dynamics, respectively. We are specially interested in the impact of the network randomness on the final distribution of opinions. For that purpose, we consider Watts-Strogatz networks, which possess the small-world property, and where randomness is controlled by a probability $p$ of adding random shortcuts to an initially regular network. Depending on the value of $p$, the average connectivity $\langle k \rangle$, and the initial conditions, the final distribution can be basically (i) consensus, (ii) coexistence of different options, or (iii) predominance of indecision. We find that, in both dynamics, the predominance of a winning opinion is favored by increasing the number of reconnections (shortcuts), promoting consensus. In contrast to the TF case, in the PR dynamics, a fraction of undecided nodes can persist in the final state. In such cases, a maximum number of undecided nodes occurs within the small-world region, due to ties in the decision group.

010       Complex Design Networks: Structure and Dynamics
021       Why was the $6 billion FAA air traffic control project scrapped? How could the 1977 New York City blackout occur? Why do large scale engineering systems or technology projects fail? How do engineering changes and errors propagate, and how is that related to epidemics and earthquakes? In this paper we demonstrate how the rapidly expanding science of complex design networks could provide answers to these intriguing questions. 
020       We review key concepts, focusing on non-trivial topological features that often occur in real-world large-scale product design and development networks; and the remarkable interplay between these structural features and the dynamics of design rework and errors, network robustness and resilience, and design leverage via effective resource allocation. We anticipate that the empirical and theoretical insights gained by modeling real-world large-scale product design and development systems as self-organizing complex networks will turn out to be the standard framework of a genuine science of design.

021       Community structures detection is one of the fundamental problems in complex network analysis towards understanding the topology structures of the network and the functions of it. 
020       Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method for community detection, and modularity Q and modularity density D are criteria to evaluate the quality of community structures. In this paper, we establish the connections between Q, D and NMF for the first time. Q maximization can be approximately reformulated under the framework of NMF with Frobenius norm, especially when $n$ is large, and D maximization can also be reformulated under the framework of NMF. Q minimization can be reformulated under the framework of NMF with Kullback-Leibler divergence. We propose new methods for community structures detection based on the above findings, and the experimental results on synthetic networks demonstrate their effectiveness.

010       QuickNAT: Segmenting MRI Neuroanatomy in 20 seconds
021       Whole brain segmentation from structural magnetic resonance imaging is a prerequisite for most morphological analyses, but requires hours of processing time and therefore delays the availability of image markers after scan acquisition. 
020       We introduce QuickNAT, a fully convolution neural network that segments a brain scan in 20 seconds. To enable training of the complex network with limited annotated data, we propose to pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation software and to subsequently fine-tune on manual labels. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods, while being about 700 times faster. This drastic speed up greatly facilitates the processing of large data repositories and supports the translation of imaging biomarkers by making them almost instantaneously available.

010       Enhancing Stratified Graph Sampling Algorithms based on Approximate   Degree Distribution
021       Sampling technique has become one of the recent research focuses in the graph-related fields. 
020       Most of the existing graph sampling algorithms tend to sample the high degree or low degree nodes in the complex networks because of the characteristic of scale-free. Scale-free means that degrees of different nodes are subject to a power law distribution. So, there is a significant difference in the degrees between the overall sampling nodes. In this paper, we propose an idea of approximate degree distribution and devise a stratified strategy using it in the complex networks. We also develop two graph sampling algorithms combining the node selection method with the stratified strategy. The experimental results show that our sampling algorithms preserve several properties of different graphs and behave more accurately than other algorithms. Further, we prove the proposed algorithms are superior to the off-the-shelf algorithms in terms of the unbiasedness of the degrees and more efficient than state-of-the-art FFS and ES-i algorithms.

010       An evolutionary game model for behavioral gambit of loyalists: Global   awareness and risk-aversion
021       We study the phase diagram of a minority game where three classes of agents are present. 
020       Two types of agents play a risk-loving game that we model by the standard Snowdrift Game. The behaviour of the third type of agents is coded by {\em indifference} w.r.t. the game at all: their dynamics is designed to account for risk-aversion as an innovative behavioral gambit. From this point of view, the choice of this solitary strategy is enhanced when innovation starts, while is depressed when it becomes the majority option. This implies that the payoff matrix of the game becomes dependent on the global awareness of the agents measured by the relevance of the population of the indifferent players. The resulting dynamics is non-trivial with different kinds of phase transition depending on a few model parameters. The phase diagram is studied on regular as well as complex networks.

010       The VLT/MUSE view of the central galaxy in Abell 2052. Ionized gas swept   by the expanding radio source
021       We report observations of the radio galaxy 3C317 (at z=0.0345) located at the center of the Abell cluster A2052, obtained with the VLT/MUSE integral field spectrograph. 
020       The Chandra images of this cluster show cavities in the X-ray emitting gas, which were produced by the expansion of the radio lobes inflated by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our exquisite MUSE data show with unprecedented detail the complex network of line emitting filaments enshrouding the northern X-ray cavity. We do not detect any emission lines from the southern cavity, with a luminosity asymmetry between the two regions higher than about 75. The emission lines produced by the warm phase of the interstellar medium (WIM) enable us to obtain unique information on the properties of the emitting gas. We find dense gas (up to 270 cm-3) that makes up part of a global quasi spherical outflow that is driven by the radio source, and obtain a direct estimate of the expansion velocity of the cavities (265 km s-1). The emission lines diagnostic rules out ionization from the AGN or from star-forming regions, suggesting instead ionization from slow shocks or from cosmic rays. The striking asymmetric line emission observed between the two cavities contrasts with the less pronounced differences between the north and south sides in the hot gas; this represents a significant new ingredient for our understanding of the process of the exchange of energy between the relativistic plasma and the external medium. We conclude that the expanding radio lobes displace the hot tenuous phase of the interstellar medium (ISM), but also impact the colder and denser ISM phases. These results show the effects of the AGN on its host and the importance of radio mode feedback.

010       Eigenvector localization in real networks and its implications for   epidemic spreading
021       The spectral properties of the adjacency matrix, in particular its largest eigenvalue and the associated principal eigenvector, dominate many structural and dynamical properties of complex networks. 
020       Here we focus on the localization properties of the principal eigenvector in real networks. We show that in most cases it is either localized on the star defined by the node with largest degree (hub) and its nearest neighbors, or on the densely connected subgraph defined by the maximum $K$-core in a $K$-core decomposition. The localization of the principal eigenvector is often strongly correlated with the value of the largest eigenvalue, which is given by the local eigenvalue of the corresponding localization subgraph, but different scenarios sometimes occur. We additionally show that simple targeted immunization strategies for epidemic spreading are extremely sensitive to the actual localization set.

020       To support students, teachers, developers and researchers in this work we introduce a novel framework, namely NDlib, an environment designed to describe diffusion simulations. NDlib is designed to be a multi-level ecosystem that can be fruitfully used by different user segments. For this reason, upon NDlib, we designed a simulation server that allows remote execution of experiments as well as an online visualization tool that abstracts its programmatic interface and makes available the simulation platform to non-technicians.

010       Synchronization transition in Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model on complex   networks with partial degree-frequency correlation
021       We investigate transition to synchronization in Sakaguchi-Kuramoto (SK) model on complex networks analytically as well as numerically. 
020       Natural frequencies of a percentage ($f$) of higher degree nodes of the network are assumed to be correlated with their degrees and that of the remaining nodes are drawn from some standard distribution namely Lorenz distribution. The effects of variation of $f$ and phase frustration parameter $\alpha$ on transition to synchronization are investigated in detail. Self-consistent equations involving critical coupling strength ($\lambda_c$) and group angular velocity ($\Omega_c$) at the onset of synchronization have been derived analytically in the thermodynamic limit. For the detailed investigation we considered SK model on scale-free as well as Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks. Interestingly explosive synchronization (ES) has been observed in both the networks for different ranges of values of $\alpha$ and $f$. For scale-free networks, as the value of $f$ is set within $10\% \leq f \leq 70\%$, the range of the values of $\alpha$ for existence of the ES is greatly enhanced compared to the fully degree-frequency correlated case. On the other hand, for random networks, ES observed in a narrow window of $\alpha$ when the value of $f$ is taken within $30\% \leq f \leq 50\%$. In all the cases critical coupling strengths for transition to synchronization computed from the analytically derived self-consistent equations show a very good agreement with the numerical results.

010       Toward Stronger Robustness of Network Controllability: A Snapback   Network Model
021       A new complex network model, called q-snapback network, is introduced. 
020       Basic topological characteristics of the network, such as degree distribution, average path length, clustering coefficient and Pearson correlation coefficient, are evaluated. The typical 4-motifs of the network are simulated. The robustness of both state and structural controllabilities of the network against targeted and random node- and edge-removal attacks, with comparisons to the multiplex congruence network and the generic scale-free network, are presented. It is shown that the q-snapback network has the strongest robustness of controllabilities due to its advantageous inherent structure with many chain- and loop-motifs.

010       G protein-coupled receptor-mediated calcium signaling in astrocytes
021       Astrocytes express a large variety of G~protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which mediate the transduction of extracellular signals into intracellular calcium responses. 
020       This transduction is provided by a complex network of biochemical reactions which mobilizes a wealth of possible calcium-mobilizing second messenger molecules. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is probably the best known of these molecules whose enzymes for its production and degradation are nonetheless calcium-dependent. We present a biophysical modeling approach based on the assumption of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, to effectively describe GPCR-mediated astrocytic calcium signals. Our model is then used to study different mechanisms at play in stimulus encoding by shape and frequency of calcium oscillations in astrocytes.

010       A Tutorial on Modeling and Analysis of Dynamic Social Networks. Part II
021       Recent years have witnessed a significant trend towards filling the gap between Social Network Analysis (SNA) and control theory. 
020       This trend was enabled by the introduction of new mathematical models describing dynamics of social groups, the development of algorithms and software for data analysis and the tremendous progress in understanding complex networks and multi-agent systems (MAS) dynamics. The aim of this tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with dynamic models of social networks and processes over them, to the attention of the broad research community. In its first part [1], we have considered the most classical models of social dynamics, which have anticipated and to a great extent inspired the recent extensive studies on MAS and complex networks. This paper is the second part of the tutorial, and it is focused on more recent models of social processes that have been developed concurrently with MAS theory. Future perspectives of control in social and techno-social systems are also discussed.

010       Network flow of mobile agents enhances the evolution of cooperation
021       We study the effect of contingent movement on the persistence of cooperation on complex networks with empty nodes. 
020       Each agent plays Prisoner's Dilemma game with its neighbors and then it either updates the strategy depending on the payoff difference with neighbors or it moves to another empty node if not satisfied with its own payoff. If no neighboring node is empty, each agent stays at the same site. By extensive evolutionary simulations, we show that the medium density of agents enhances cooperation where the network flow of mobile agents is also medium. Moreover, if the movements of agents are more frequent than the strategy updating, cooperation is further promoted. In scale-free networks, the optimal density for cooperation is lower than other networks because agents get stuck at hubs. Our study suggests that keeping a smooth network flow is significant for the persistence of cooperation in ever-changing societies.

010       Effective Building Block Design for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks   using Search
021       Deep learning has shown promising results on many machine learning tasks but DL models are often complex networks with large number of neurons and layers, and recently, complex layer structures known as building blocks. 
020       Finding the best deep model requires a combination of finding both the right architecture and the correct set of parameters appropriate for that architecture. In addition, this complexity (in terms of layer types, number of neurons, and number of layers) also present problems with generalization since larger networks are easier to overfit to the data. In this paper, we propose a search framework for finding effective architectural building blocks for convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our approach is much faster at finding models that are close to state-of-the-art in performance. In addition, the models discovered by our approach are also smaller than models discovered by similar techniques. We achieve these twin advantages by designing our search space in such a way that it searches over a reduced set of state-of-the-art building blocks for CNNs including residual block, inception block, inception-residual block, ResNeXt block and many others. We apply this technique to generate models for multiple image datasets and show that these models achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art (and even surpassing the state-of-the-art in one case). We also show that learned models are transferable between datasets.

010       Predicting the patterns of spatio-temporal signal propagation in complex   networks
021       A major achievement in the study of complex networks is the observation that diverse systems, from sub-cellular biology to social networks, exhibit universal topological characteristics. 
020       Yet this universality does not naturally translate to the dynamics of these systems , hindering our progress towards a general theoretical framework of network dynamics. The source of this theoretical gap is the fact that the behavior of a complex system cannot be uniquely predicted from its topology, but rather depends also on the dynamic mechanisms of interaction between the nodes, hence systems with similar structure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behavior. To bridge this gap, we derive here the patterns of network information transmission, indeed, the essence of a network's behavior, by offering a systematic translation of topology into the actual spatio-temporal propagation of perturbative signals. We predict, for an extremely broad range of nonlinear dynamic models, that the propagation rules condense around three highly distinctive dynamic universality classes, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree distribution and the interaction dynamics. Our formalism helps us leverage the major advances in the mapping of real world networks, into predictions on the actual dynamic propagation, from the spread of viruses in social networks to the discussion of genetic information in cellular systems.

010       Fast Cosmic Web Simulations with Generative Adversarial Networks
021       Dark matter in the universe evolves through gravity to form a complex network of halos, filaments, sheets and voids, that is known as the cosmic web. 
020       Computational models of the underlying physical processes, such as classical N-body simulations, are extremely resource intensive, as they track the action of gravity in an expanding universe using billions of particles as tracers of the cosmic matter distribution. Therefore, upcoming cosmology experiments will face a computational bottleneck that may limit the exploitation of their full scientific potential. To address this challenge, we demonstrate the application of a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn models that can efficiently generate new, physically realistic realizations of the cosmic web. Our training set is a small, representative sample of 2D image snapshots from N-body simulations of size 500 and 100 Mpc. We show that the GAN-produced results are qualitatively and quantitatively very similar to the originals. Generation of a new cosmic web realization with a GAN takes a fraction of a second, compared to the many hours needed by the N-body technique. We anticipate that GANs will therefore play an important role in providing extremely fast and precise simulations of cosmic web in the era of large cosmological surveys, such as Euclid and LSST.

010       A statistical inference approach to structural reconstruction of complex   networks from binary time series
021       Complex networks hosting binary-state dynamics arise in a variety of contexts. 
020       In spite of previous works, to fully reconstruct the network structure from observed binary data remains to be challenging. We articulate a statistical inference based approach to this problem. In particular, exploiting the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, we develop a method to ascertain the neighbors of any node in the network based solely on binary data, thereby recovering the full topology of the network. A key ingredient of our method is the maximum likelihood estimation of the probabilities associated with actual or non-existent links, and we show that the EM algorithm can distinguish the two kinds of probability values without any ambiguity, insofar as the length of the available binary time series is reasonably long. Our method does not require any {\em a priori} knowledge of the detailed dynamical processes, is parameter free, and is capable of accurate reconstruction even in the presence of noise. We demonstrate the method using combinations of distinct types of binary dynamical processes and network topologies, and provide a physical understanding of the underlying reconstruction mechanism. Our statistical inference based reconstruction method contributes an additional piece to the rapidly expanding "toolbox" of data based reverse engineering of complex networked systems.

020       This NP-hard problem has numerous real-world applications in complex networks, including efficient construction of graph layouts, analysis of social networks or bioinformatics. Our algorithm is based on reinforcing the probability of traversing the edges, which have not been present in the long cycles found so far. Experimental results are presented for a set of social networks, protein-protein interation networks, network science graphs and DIMACS graphs. For 6 out of our 22 real-world network test instances, ANTH-LS has obtained an improvement on the longest cycle ever found.

021       We present a prototype of a software tool for exploration of multiple combinatorial optimisation problems in large real-world and synthetic complex networks. 
020       Our tool, called GraphCombEx (an acronym of Graph Combinatorial Explorer), provides a unified framework for scalable computation and presentation of high-quality suboptimal solutions and bounds for a number of widely studied combinatorial optimisation problems. Efficient representation and applicability to large-scale graphs and complex networks are particularly considered in its design. The problems currently supported include maximum clique, graph colouring, maximum independent set, minimum vertex clique covering, minimum dominating set, as well as the longest simple cycle problem. Suboptimal solutions and intervals for optimal objective values are estimated using scalable heuristics. The tool is designed with extensibility in mind, with the view of further problems and both new fast and high-performance heuristics to be added in the future. GraphCombEx has already been successfully used as a support tool in a number of recent research studies using combinatorial optimisation to analyse complex networks, indicating its promise as a research software tool.

010       Energy Scaling with Control Distance in Complex Networks
021       It has recently been shown that the expected energy requirements of a control action applied to a complex network scales exponentially with the number of nodes that are targeted. 
020       While the exponential scaling law provides an adequate prediction of the mean required energy, it has also been shown that the spread of energy values for a particular number of targets is large. Here, we explore more closely the effect distance between driver nodes and target nodes and the magnitude of self-regulation has on the energy of the control action. We find that the energy scaling law can be written to include information about the distance between driver nodes and target nodes to more accurately predict control energy.

010       Network construction: A learning framework through localizing principal   eigenvector
021       Recently, eigenvector localization of complex network has seen a spurt in activities due to its versatile applicability in many different areas which includes networks centrality measure, spectral partitioning, development of approximation algorithms and disease spreading phenomenon. 
020       For a network, an eigenvector is said to be localized when most of its components are near to zero, with few taking very high values. Here, we develop three different randomized algorithms, which by using edge rewiring method, can evolve a random network having a delocalized principal eigenvector to a network having a highly localized principal eigenvector. We discuss drawbacks and advantages of these algorithms. Additionally, we show that the construction of such networks corresponding to the highly localized principal eigenvector is a non-convex optimization problem when the objective function is the inverse participation ratio.

010       Complex Network Geometry and Frustrated Synchronization
021       The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their dimensionality. 
020       However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators, and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral dimension of the network.

010       Disunited Nations? A Multiplex Network Approach to Detecting Preference   Affinity Blocs using Texts and Votes
021       This paper contributes to an emerging literature that models votes and text in tandem to better understand polarization of expressed preferences. 
020       It introduces a new approach to estimate preference polarization in multidimensional settings, such as international relations, based on developments in the natural language processing and network science literatures -- namely word embeddings, which retain valuable syntactical qualities of human language, and community detection in multilayer networks, which locates densely connected actors across multiple, complex networks. We find that the employment of these tools in tandem helps to better estimate states' foreign policy preferences expressed in UN votes and speeches beyond that permitted by votes alone. The utility of these located affinity blocs is demonstrated through an application to conflict onset in International Relations, though these tools will be of interest to all scholars faced with the measurement of preferences and polarization in multidimensional settings.

010       Complex Network Classification with Convolutional Neural Network
021       Classifying large scale networks into several categories and distinguishing them according to their fine structures is of great importance with several applications in real life. 
020       However, most studies of complex networks focus on properties of a single network but seldom on classification, clustering, and comparison between different networks, in which the network is treated as a whole. Due to the non-Euclidean properties of the data, conventional methods can hardly be applied on networks directly. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of complex network classifier (CNC) by integrating network embedding and convolutional neural network to tackle the problem of network classification. By training the classifiers on synthetic complex network data and real international trade network data, we show CNC can not only classify networks in a high accuracy and robustness, it can also extract the features of the networks automatically.

010       Unveiling Relationships Between Crime and Property in England and Wales   Via Density Scale-Adjusted Metrics and Network Tools
021       Scale-adjusted metrics (SAMs) are a significant achievement of the urban scaling hypothesis. 
020       SAMs remove the inherent biases of per capita measures computed in the absence of isometric allometries. However, this approach is limited to urban areas, while a large portion of the world's population still lives outside cities and rural areas dominate land use worldwide. Here, we extend the concept of SAMs to population density scale-adjusted metrics (DSAMs) to reveal relationships among different types of crime and property metrics. Our approach allows all human environments to be considered, avoids problems in the definition of urban areas, and accounts for the heterogeneity of population distributions within urban regions. By combining DSAMs, cross-correlation, and complex network analysis, we find that crime and property types have intricate and hierarchically organized relationships leading to some striking conclusions. Drugs and burglary had uncorrelated DSAMs and, to the extent property transaction values are indicators of affluence, twelve out of fourteen crime metrics showed no evidence of specifically targeting affluence. Burglary and robbery were the most connected in our network analysis and the modular structures suggest an alternative to "zero-tolerance" policies by unveiling the crime and/or property types most likely to affect each other.

010       Identifying the global terror hubs and vulnerable motifs using complex   network dynamics
021       Terrorism instills fear in the minds of people and takes away the freedom of individuals to act as they will. 
020       Terrorism has turned out to be an international menace in the global community; every nation is getting affected, directly or indirectly. Here, we study the terrorist attack incidents which occurred in the last half century across the globe from the open source, Global terrorism database, and develop a view on their spatio-temporal dynamics. We construct a complex network of global terrorism and study its growth dynamics, along with the statistical properties of the network, which are quite intriguing. Normally, each nation pursues its own vision of international security based upon its mandate and particular notions of politics and its policies to counter the threat of terrorism that could naturally include the use of tactical measures and strategic negotiations, or even physical power. We study the resilience of the network against targeted attacks and random failures, which could guide the counter-terrorist outfits in designing strategies to fight terrorism. We then use a disparity filter method to isolate the backbone of the giant component, and identify the terror hubs and vulnerable motifs of global terrorism. We also examine the evolution of the hubs and motifs in a few exemplary cases like Afghanistan, Colombia, Israel, Peru and United Kingdom. The dynamics of the terror hubs and the vulnerable motifs that we discover in the network backbone can provide deep insight on their formations and spreading, and thereby help in contending terrorism or making public policies that can check their spread.

010       Minimum curvilinear automata with similarity attachment for network   embedding and link prediction in the hyperbolic space
021       The idea of minimum curvilinearity (MC) is that the hidden geometry of complex networks, in particular when they are sufficiently sparse, clustered, small-world and heterogeneous, can be efficiently navigated using the minimum spanning tree (MST), which is a greedy navigator. 
020       The local topological information drives the global geometrical navigation and the MST can be interpreted as a growing path that greedily maximizes local similarity between the nodes attached at each step by globally minimizing their overall distances in the network. This is also valid in absence of the network structure and in presence of only the nodes geometrically located over the network generative manifold in a high-dimensional space. We know that random geometric graphs in the hyperbolic space are an adequate model for realistic complex networks: the explanation of this connection is that complex networks exhibit hierarchical, tree-like organization, and in turn the hyperbolic geometry is the geometry of trees. Here we show that, according to a mechanism that we define similarity attachment, the visited node sequence of a network automaton can efficiently approximate the nodes' angular coordinates in the hyperbolic disk, that actually represent an ordering of their similarities. This is a consequence of the fact that the MST, during its greedy growing process, at each step sequentially attaches the node most similar (less distant) to its own cohort. Minimum curvilinear automata (MCA) displays embedding accuracy which seems superior to HyperMap-CN and inferior to coalescent embedding, however its link prediction performance on real networks is without precedent for methods based on the hyperbolic space. Finally, depending on the data structure used to build the MST, the MCA's time complexity can also approach a linear dependence from the number of edges.

010       Superdiffusion and time-dependent long-range interactions on networks
021       This work addresses the motion of a random walker on a discrete structure with the presence of long-range interactions, the strength of which can change in time. 
020       No restriction is made on the nature of the substrate, which may range from ordered lattice to complex network. The presence of long-range interactions on regular lattices with nearest-neighbor hops enhances the speed of the diffusive motion, but the dependence of the mean square displacement (MSD) traveled by the walker has been found to still increase linearly with time. In contrast to this, our results for a model where strength of long range interactions increases with time reveals a non linear dependence of MSD with respect to time. The time duration of such a dependence, as well as the value of power law exponent, depend on the way the interactions change in time. The model on the cycle graph is amenable to exact analytical treatment within the Markov chain framework. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions, and can be easily extended to complex structures where analytical approaches are not possible.

010       Multilayer Network Modeling of Integrated Biological Systems
021       Biological systems, from a cell to the human brain, are inherently complex. 
020       A powerful representation of such systems, described by an intricate web of relationships across multiple scales, is provided by complex networks. Recently, several studies are highlighting how simple networks -- obtained by aggregating or neglecting temporal or categorical description of biological data -- are not able to account for the richness of information characterizing biological systems. More complex models, namely multilayer networks, are needed to account for interdependencies, often varying across time, of biological interacting units within a cell, a tissue or parts of an organism.

010       Current Flow Group Closeness Centrality for Complex Networks
021       Current flow closeness centrality (CFCC) has a better discriminating ability than the ordinary closeness centrality based on shortest paths. 
020       In this paper, we extend this notion to a group of vertices in a weighted graph, and then study the problem of finding a subset $S$ of $k$ vertices to maximize its CFCC $C(S)$, both theoretically and experimentally. We show that the problem is NP-hard, but propose two greedy algorithms for minimizing the reciprocal of $C(S)$ with provable guarantees using the monotoncity and supermodularity. The first is a deterministic algorithm with an approximation factor $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\cdot\frac{1}{e})$ and cubic running time; while the second is a randomized algorithm with a $(1-\frac{k}{k-1}\cdot\frac{1}{e}-\epsilon)$-approximation and nearly-linear running time for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Extensive experiments on model and real networks demonstrate that our algorithms are effective and efficient, with the second algorithm being scalable to massive networks with more than a million vertices.

010       Synergistic cumulative contagion in epidemic spreading
021       Most epidemic spreading models assume memoryless agents and independent transmissions along different infection channels. 
020       Nevertheless, many real-life cases are manifestly time-sensitive and show strong correlations. Although some recent research efforts have analyzed the effects of memory and others have explored synergistic contagion schemes, both topics are rarely combined. We develop a microscopic description of the infection mechanism that is endowed with memory of past exposures and simultaneously incorporates the joint effect of multiple infectious sources. Already in unstructured substrates our simulations show a rich variety of phenomena, including loss of universality, collective memory loss, bistability, hysteresis and excitability. These features are the product of an intricate balance between two memory modes and indicate that non-Markovian effects significantly alter the properties of contagion and spreading processes. The future inclusion of heterogeneous contact networks and more elaborate modeling details will provide additional insight on the relevance of microscopic mechanisms and topological properties regarding dynamical processes in complex networks.

010       Updating Dynamic Random Hyperbolic Graphs in Sublinear Time
021       Generative network models play an important role in algorithm development, scaling studies, network analysis, and realistic system benchmarks for graph data sets. 
020       A complex network model gaining considerable popularity builds random hyperbolic graphs, generated by distributing points within a disk in the hyperbolic plane and then adding edges between points with a probability depending on their hyperbolic distance. <br />We present a dynamic extension to model gradual network change, while preserving at each step the point position probabilities. To process the dynamic changes efficiently, we formalize the concept of a probabilistic neighborhood: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in Euclidean or hyperbolic space, $q$ a query point, $\operatorname{dist}$ a distance metric, and $f : \mathbb{R}^+ \rightarrow [0,1]$ a monotonically decreasing function. Then, the probabilistic neighborhood $N(q, f)$ of $q$ with respect to $f$ is a random subset of $P$ and each point $p \in P$ belongs to $N(q,f)$ with probability $f(\operatorname{dist}(p,q))$. We present a fast, sublinear-time query algorithm to sample probabilistic neighborhoods from planar point sets. For certain distributions of planar $P$, we prove that our algorithm answers a query in $O((|N(q,f)| + \sqrt{n})\log n)$ time with high probability. This enables us to process a node movement in random hyperbolic graphs in sublinear time, resulting in a speedup of about one order of magnitude in practice compared to the fastest previous approach. Apart from that, our query algorithm is also applicable to Euclidean geometry, making it of independent interest for other sampling or probabilistic spreading scenarios.

010       From the difference of structures to the structure of the difference
021       When dealing with evolving or multi-dimensional complex systems, network theory provides with elegant ways of describing their constituting components, through respectively time-varying and multi-layer complex networks. 
020       Nevertheless, the analysis of how these components are related is still an open problem. We here propose a framework for analysing the evolution of a (complex) system, by describing the structure created by the difference between multiple networks by means of the Information Content metric. As opposed to other approaches, as for instance the use of global overlap or entropies, the proposed one allows to understand if the observed changes are due to random noise, or to structural (targeted) modifications. We validate the framework by means of sets of synthetic networks, as well as networks representing real technological, social and biological evolving systems. We further propose a way of reconstructing network correlograms, which allow to convert the system's evolution to the frequency domain.

010       Paraphrasing Complex Network: Network Compression via Factor Transfer
021       Deep neural networks (DNN) have recently shown promising performances in various areas. 
020       Although DNNs are very powerful, a large number of network parameters requires substantial storage and memory bandwidth which hinders them from being applied to actual embedded systems. Many researchers have sought ways of model compression to reduce the size of a network with minimal performance degradation. Among them, a method called knowledge transfer is to train the student network with a stronger teacher network. In this paper, we propose a method to overcome the limitations of conventional knowledge transfer methods and improve the performance of a student network. An auto-encoder is used in an unsupervised manner to extract compact factors which are defined as compressed feature maps of the teacher network. When using the factors to train the student network, we observed that the performance of the student network becomes better than the ones with other conventional knowledge transfer methods because factors contain paraphrased compact information of the teacher network that is easy for the student network to understand.

010       Fundamental ingredients for the emergence of discontinuous phase   transitions in the majority vote model
021       Discontinuous transitions have received considerable interest due to the uncovering that many phenomena such as catastrophic changes, epidemic outbreaks and synchronization present a behavior signed by abrupt (macroscopic) changes (instead of smooth ones) as a tuning parameter is changed. 
020       However, in different cases there are still scarce microscopic models reproducing such above trademarks. With these ideas in mind, we investigate the fundamental ingredients underpinning the discontinuous transition in one of the simplest systems with up-down $Z_2$ symmetry recently ascertained in [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 95}, 042304 (2017)]. Such system, in the presence of an extra ingredient-the inertia- has its continuous transition being switched to a discontinuous one in complex networks. We scrutinize the role of three fundamental ingredients: inertia, system degree, and the lattice topology. Our analysis has been carried out for regular lattices and random regular networks with different node degrees (interacting neighborhood) through mean-field treatment and numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that not only the inertia but also the connectivity constitute essential elements for shifting the phase transition. Astoundingly, they also manifest in low-dimensional regular topologies, exposing a scaling behavior entirely different than those from the complex networks case. Therefore, our findings put on firmer bases the essential issues for the manifestation of discontinuous transitions in such relevant class of systems with $Z_2$ symmetry.

010       Moran-evolution of cooperation: From well-mixed to heterogeneous complex   networks
021       Configurational arrangement of network architecture and interaction character of individuals are two most influential factors on the mechanisms underlying the evolutionary outcome of cooperation, which is explained by the well-established framework of evolutionary game theory. 
020       In the current study, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively, we measure Moran-evolution of cooperation to support an analytical agreement based on the consequences of the replicator equation in a finite population. The validity of the measurement has been double-checked in the well-mixed network by the Langevin stochastic differential equation and the Gillespie-algorithmic version of Moran-evolution, while in a structured network, the measurement of accuracy is verified by the standard numerical simulation. Considering the Birth-Death and Death-Birth updating rules through diffusion of individuals, the investigation is carried out in the wide range of game environments those relate to the various social dilemmas where we are able to draw a new rigorous mathematical track to tackle the heterogeneity of complex networks. The set of modified criteria reveals the exact fact about the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in the structured population. We find that in general, nature promotes the environment of coexistent traits.

010       A Centrality Measure for Cycles and Subgraphs II
021       In a recent work we introduced a measure of importance for groups of vertices in a complex network. 
020       This centrality for groups is always between 0 and 1 and induces the eigenvector centrality over vertices. Furthermore, its value over any group is the fraction of all network flows intercepted by this group. Here we provide the rigorous mathematical constructions underpinning these results via a semi-commutative extension of a number theoretic sieve. We then established further relations between the eigenvector centrality and the centrality proposed here, showing that the latter is a proper extension of the former to groups of nodes. We finish by comparing the centrality proposed here with the notion of group-centrality introduced by Everett and Borgatti on two real-world networks: the Wolfe's dataset and the protein-protein interaction network of the yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}. In this latter case, we demonstrate that the centrality is able to distinguish protein complexes.

010       Network Centrality Analysis of Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway System

020       This complex transportation system contains 168 links between each station pairs and 20 cross-section and Y-branch stations among all eight lines. In this study, we considered TUSRS as a complex network and undertook several analyzes based on graph theory. Examining e.g. centrality measures, we identified central stations within TUSRS. This analysis could be useful for redistributing strategy of the overcrowded stations and improving the organization of maintaining system. These findings are also promising for better designing the systems of tomorrow in other metropolitan areas in Iran.

010       First-order bifurcation detection for dynamic complex networks
021       In this paper, we explore how network centrality and network entropy can be used to identify a bifurcation network event. 
020       A bifurcation often occurs when a network undergoes a qualitative change in its structure as a response to internal changes or external signals. In this paper, we show that network centrality allows us to capture important topological properties of dynamic networks. By extracting multiple centrality features from a network for dimensionality reduction, we are able to track the network dynamics underlying an intrinsic low-dimensional manifold. Moreover, we employ von Neumann graph entropy (VNGE) to measure the information divergence between networks over time. In particular, we propose an asymptotically consistent estimator of VNGE so that the cubic complexity of VNGE is reduced to quadratic complexity that scales more gracefully with network size. Finally, the effectiveness of our approaches is demonstrated through a real-life application of cyber intrusion detection.

010       Continual Reinforcement Learning with Complex Synapses
021       Unlike humans, who are capable of continual learning over their lifetimes, artificial neural networks have long been known to suffer from a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting, whereby new learning can lead to abrupt erasure of previously acquired knowledge. 
020       Whereas in a neural network the parameters are typically modelled as scalar values, an individual synapse in the brain comprises a complex network of interacting biochemical components that evolve at different timescales. In this paper, we show that by equipping tabular and deep reinforcement learning agents with a synaptic model that incorporates this biological complexity (Benna &amp; Fusi, 2016), catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated at multiple timescales. In particular, we find that as well as enabling continual learning across sequential training of two simple tasks, it can also be used to overcome within-task forgetting by reducing the need for an experience replay database.

010       Communication Melting in Graphs and Complex Networks
021       Complex networks are the representative graphs of interactions in many complex systems. 
020       Usually, these interactions are abstractions of the communication/diffusion channels between the units of the system. Real complex networks, e.g. traffic networks, reveal different operation phases governed by the dynamical stress of the system. Here we show how, communicability, a topological descriptor that reveals the efficiency of the network functionality in terms of these diffusive paths, could be used to reveal the transitions mentioned. By considering a vibrational model of nodes and edges in a graph/network at a given temperature (stress), we show that the communicability function plays the role of the thermal Green's function of a network of harmonic oscillators. After, we prove analytically the existence of a universal phase transition in the communicability structure of every simple graph. This transition resembles the melting process occurring in solids. For instance, regular-like graphs resembling crystals, melts at lower temperatures and display a sharper transition between connected to disconnected structures than the random spatial graphs, which resemble amorphous solids. Finally, we study computationally this graph melting process in some real-world networks and observe that the rate of melting of graphs changes either as an exponential or as a power-law with the inverse temperature. At the local level we discover that the main driver for node melting is the eigenvector centrality of the corresponding node, particularly when the critical value of the inverse temperature approaches zero. These universal results sheds light on many dynamical diffusive-like processes on networks that present transitions as traffic jams, communication lost or failure cascades.

010       Relevance of the minimum degree to dynamic fluctuation in strongly   heterogeneous networks
021       The fluctuation of dynamic variables in complex networks is known to depend on the dimension and the heterogeneity of the substrate networks. 
020       Previous studies, however, have reported inconsistent results for the scaling behavior of fluctuation in strongly heterogeneous networks. To understand the origin of this conflict, we study the dynamic fluctuation on scale-free networks with a common small degree exponent but different mean degrees and minimum degrees constructed by using the configuration model and the static model. It turns out that the global fluctuation of dynamic variables diverges algebraically and logarithmically with the system size when the minimum degree is one and two, respectively. Such different global fluctuations are traced back to different, linear and sub-linear, growth of local fluctuation at individual nodes with their degrees, implying a crucial role of degree-one nodes in controlling correlation between distinct hubs.

010       Importance of initial conditions in the polarization of complex networks
021       Currently used models of opinion formation use random initial conditions. 
020       In reality, most people in a social network, except for a small fraction of the population, are initially either unaware of, or indifferent to, the disputed issue. To explore the consequences of such specific initial conditions, we study the polarization of social networks when conflicting ideas arise on two different seed nodes and then spread according to a majority rule. Using the configuration model and the stochastic block model as examples, we show that this framework leads to substantially different outcomes than those which employ random initial conditions. Moreover, the empirically observed splits in the karate and the dolphins' networks naturally come out of this paradigm. Our work thus suggests that the existing opinion dynamics models should be reevaluated to incorporate the initial condition dependence.

010       The Dynamics of Knowledge Acquisition via Self-Learning in Complex   Networks
021       Studies regarding knowledge organization and acquisition are of great importance to understand areas related to science and technology. 
020       A common way to model the relationship between different concepts is through complex networks. In such representations, network's nodes store knowledge and edges represent their relationships. Several studies that considered this type of structure and knowledge acquisition dynamics employed one or more agents to discover node concepts by walking on the network. In this study, we investigate a different type of dynamics considering a single node as the "network brain". Such brain represents a range of real systems such as the information about the environment that is acquired by a person and is stored in the brain. To store the discovered information in a specific node, the agents walk on the network and return to the brain. We propose three different dynamics and test them on several network models and on a real system, which is formed by journal articles and their respective citations. Surprisingly, the results revealed that, according to the adopted walking models, the efficiency of self-knowledge acquisition has only a weak dependency on the topology, search strategy and localization of the network brain.

010       Preferential attachment mechanism of complex network growth:   &quot;rich-gets-richer&quot; or &quot;fit-gets-richer&quot;?
021       We analyze the growth models for complex networks including preferential attachment (A.-L. 
020       Barabasi and R. Albert, Science 286, 509 (1999)) and fitness model (Caldarelli et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 258702 (2002)) and demonstrate that, under very general conditions, these two models yield the same dynamic equation of network growth, $\frac{dK}{dt}=A(t)(K+K_{0})$, where $A(t)$ is the aging constant, $K$ is the node's degree, and $K_{0}$ is the initial attractivity. Basing on this result, we show that the fitness model provides an underlying microscopic basis for the preferential attachment mechanism. This approach yields long-sought explanation for the initial attractivity, an elusive parameter which was left unexplained within the framework of the preferential attachment model. We show that $K_{0}$ is mainly determined by the width of the fitness distribution. The measurements of $K_{0}$ in many complex networks usually yield the same $K_{0}\sim 1$. This empirical universality can be traced to frequently occurring lognormal fitness distribution with the width $\sigma\approx 1$.

010       Ab initio Algorithmic Causal Deconvolution of Intertwined Programs and   Networks by Generative Mechanism
021       To extract and learn representations leading to generative mechanisms from data, especially without making arbitrary decisions and biased assumptions, is a central challenge in most areas of scientific research particularly in connection to current major limitations of influential topics and methods of machine and deep learning as they have often lost sight of the model component. 
020       Complex data is usually produced by interacting sources with different mechanisms. Here we introduce a parameter-free model-based approach, based upon the seminal concept of Algorithmic Probability, that decomposes an observation and signal into its most likely algorithmic generative mechanisms. Our methods use a causal calculus to infer model representations. We demonstrate the method ability to distinguish interacting mechanisms and deconvolve them, regardless of whether the objects produce strings, space-time evolution diagrams, images or networks. We numerically test and evaluate our method and find that it can disentangle observations from discrete dynamic systems, random and complex networks. We think that these causal inference techniques can contribute as key pieces of information for estimations of probability distributions complementing other more statistical-oriented techniques that otherwise lack model inference capabilities.

010       Fast Maximum Likelihood estimation via Equilibrium Expectation for Large   Network Data
021       Complex network data may be analyzed by constructing statistical models that accurately reproduce structural properties that may be of theoretical relevance or empirical interest. 
020       In the context of the efficient fitting of models for large network data, we propose a very efficient algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters of complex statistical models. The proposed algorithm is similar to the famous Metropolis algorithm but allows a Monte Carlo simulation to be performed while constraining the desired network properties. We demonstrate the algorithm in the context of exponential random graph models (ERGMs) - a family of statistical models for network data. Thus far, the lack of efficient computational methods has limited the empirical scope of ERGMs to relatively small networks with a few thousand nodes. The proposed approach allows a dramatic increase in the size of networks that may be analyzed using ERGMs. This is illustrated in an analysis of several biological networks and one social network with 104,103 nodes.

Secondly, this work shows a method to optimize the event structure that is better than a random method and a recommendation system that achieves ~95% of accuracy.

021       We introduce distance entropy as a measure of homogeneity in the distribution of path lengths between a given node and its neighbours in a complex network. 
020       Distance entropy defines a new centrality measure whose properties are investigated for a variety of synthetic network models. By coupling distance entropy information with closeness centrality, we introduce a network cartography which allows one to reduce the degeneracy of ranking based on closeness alone. We apply this methodology to the empirical multiplex lexical network encoding the linguistic relationships known to English speaking toddlers. We show that the distance entropy cartography better predicts how children learn words compared to closeness centrality. Our results highlight the importance of distance entropy for gaining insights from distance patterns in complex networks.

010       Cooperation dynamics of generalized reciprocity in state-based social   dilemmas
021       We introduce a framework for studying social dilemmas in networked societies where individuals follow a simple state-based behavioral mechanism based on generalized reciprocity, which is rooted in the principle "help anyone if helped by someone". 
020       Within this general framework, which applies to a wide range of social dilemmas including, among others, public goods, donation and snowdrift games, we study the cooperation dynamics on a variety of complex network examples. By interpreting the studied model through the lenses of nonlinear dynamical systems, we show that cooperation through generalized reciprocity always emerges as the unique attractor in which the overall level of cooperation is maximized, while simultaneously exploitation of the participating individuals is prevented. The analysis elucidates the role of the network structure, here captured by a local centrality measure which uniquely quantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by dictating the degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and macroscopic level. We demonstrate the applicability of the analysis on a practical example by considering an interaction structure that couples a donation process with a public goods game.

021       We study the U.S. Operations Research/Industrial-Systems Engineering (ORIE) faculty hiring network, consisting of 1,179 faculty origin and destination data together with attribute data from 83 ORIE departments. 
020       A social network analysis of faculty hires can reveal important patterns in an academic field, such as the existence of a hierarchy or sociological aspects such as the presence of communities of departments. We first statistically test for the existence of a linear hierarchy in the network and for its steepness. We find a near linear hierarchical order of the departments, proposing a new index for hiring networks, which we contrast with other indicators of hierarchy, including published rankings. A single index is not capable to capture the full structure of a complex network, however, so we next fit a latent exponential random graph model (ERGM) to the network, which is able to reproduce its main observed characteristics: high incidence of self-hiring, skewed out-degree distribution, low density and clustering. Finally, we use the latent variables in the ERGM to simplify the network to one where faculty hires take place among three groups of departments. We contrast our findings with those reported for other related disciplines, Computer Science and Business.

010       EvoCut : A new Generalization of Albert-Barab\&#x27;asi Model for Evolution   of Complex Networks
021       With the evolution of social networks, the network structure shows dynamic nature in which nodes and edges appear as well as disappear for various reasons. 
020       The role of a node in the network is presented as the number of interactions it has with the other nodes. For this purpose a network is modeled as a graph where nodes represent network members and edges represent a relationship among them. Several models for evolution of social networks has been proposed till date, most widely accepted being the Barab\'asi-Albert \cite{Network science} model that is based on \emph{preferential attachment} of nodes according to the degree distribution. This model leads to generation of graphs that are called \emph{Scale Free} and the degree distribution of such graphs follow the \emph{power law}. Several generalizations of this model has also been proposed. In this paper we present a new generalization of the model and attempt to bring out its implications in real life.

010       Sparse power-law network model for reliable statistical sampling
021       A projective network model is a model that enables predictions to be made based on a subsample of the network data, with the predictions remaining unchanged if a larger sample is taken into consideration. 
020       An exchangeable model is a model that does not depend on the order in which nodes are sampled. Despite a large variety of non-equilibrium (growing) and equilibrium (static) sparse complex network models that are widely used in network science, how to reconcile sparseness (constant average degree) with the desired statistical properties of projectivity and exchangeability is currently an outstanding scientific problem. Here we propose a network process with hidden variables which is projective and can generate sparse power-law networks. Despite the model not being exchangeable, it can be closely related to exchangeable uncorrelated networks as indicated by its information theory characterization and its network entropy. The use of the proposed network process as a null model is here tested on real data, indicating that the model offers a promising avenue for statistical network modelling.

010       A complex network description of thermal quantum states in the Ising   spin chain
021       We use network analysis to describe and characterize an archetypal quantum system - an Ising spin chain in a transverse magnetic field. 
020       We analyze weighted networks for this quantum system, with link weights given by various measures of spin-spin correlations such as the von Neumann and Renyi mutual information, concurrence, and negativity. We analytically calculate the spin-spin correlations in the system at an arbitrary temperature by mapping the Ising spin chain to a fermionic system, as well as numerically calculate the correlations in the ground state using matrix product state methods, and then analyze the resulting networks using a variety of network measures. We demonstrate that the network measures show some traits of complex networks already in this spin chain, arguably the simplest quantum many-body system. The network measures give insight into the phase diagram not easily captured by more typical quantities, such as the order parameter or correlation length. For example, the network structure varies with transverse field and temperature, and the structure in the quantum critical fan region is different from the ordered and disordered phases.

010       Non-Backtracking Centrality Based Random Walk on Networks
021       Random walks are a fundamental tool for analyzing realistic complex networked systems and implementing randomized algorithms to solve diverse problems such as searching and sampling. 
020       For many real applications, their actual effect and convenience depend on the properties (e.g. stationary distribution and hitting time) of random walks, with biased random walks often outperforming traditional unbiased random walks (TURW). In this paper, we present a new class of biased random walks, non-backtracking centrality based random walks (NBCRW) on a network, where the walker prefers to jump to neighbors with high non-backtracking centrality that has some advantages over eigenvector centrality. We study some properties of the non-backtracking matrix of a network, on the basis of which we propose a theoretical framework for fast computation of the transition probabilities, stationary distribution, and hitting times for NBCRW on the network. Within the paradigm, we study NBCRW on some model and real networks and compare the results with those corresponding to TURW and maximal entropy random walks (MERW), with the latter being biased random walks based on eigenvector centrality. We show that the behaviors of stationary distribution and hitting times for NBCRW widely differ from those associated with TURW and MERW, especially for heterogeneous networks.

010       Stable and Consistent Membership at Scale with Rapid
021       We present the design and evaluation of Rapid, a distributed membership service. 
020       At Rapid's core is a scheme for multi-process cut detection (CD) that revolves around two key insights: (i) it suspects a failure of a process only after alerts arrive from multiple sources, and (ii) when a group of processes experience problems, it detects failures of the entire group, rather than conclude about each process individually. Implementing these insights translates into a simple membership algorithm with low communication overhead. <br />We present evidence that our strategy suffices to drive unanimous detection almost-everywhere, even when complex network conditions arise, such as one-way reachability problems, firewall misconfigurations, and high packet loss. Furthermore, we present both empirical evidence and analyses that proves that the almost-everywhere detection happens with high probability. To complete the design, Rapid contains a leaderless consensus protocol that converts multi-process cut detections into a view-change decision. The resulting membership service works both in fully decentralized as well as logically centralized modes. <br />We present an evaluation of Rapid in moderately scalable cloud settings. Rapid bootstraps 2000 node clusters 2-5.8x faster than prevailing tools such as Memberlist and ZooKeeper, remains stable in face of complex failure scenarios, and provides strong consistency guarantees. It is easy to integrate Rapid into existing distributed applications, of which we demonstrate two.

010       Co-occurrence simplicial complexes in mathematics: identifying the holes   of knowledge
021       In the last years complex networks tools contributed to provide insights on the structure of research, through the study of collaboration, citation and co-occurrence networks. 
020       The network approach focuses on pairwise relationships, often compressing multidimensional data structures and inevitably losing information. In this paper we propose for the first time a simplicial complex approach to word co-occurrences, providing a natural framework for the study of higher-order relations in the space of scientific knowledge. Using topological methods we explore the conceptual landscape of mathematical research, focusing on homological holes, regions with low connectivity in the simplicial structure. We find that homological holes are ubiquitous, which suggests that they capture some essential feature of research practice in mathematics. Holes die when a subset of their concepts appear in the same article, hence their death may be a sign of the creation of new knowledge, as we show with some examples. We find a positive relation between the dimension of a hole and the time it takes to be closed: larger holes may represent potential for important advances in the field because they separate conceptually distant areas. We also show that authors' conceptual entropy is positively related with their contribution to homological holes, suggesting that polymaths tend to be on the frontier of research.

010       Topological structures are consistently overestimated in functional   complex networks
021       Functional complex networks have meant a pivotal change in the way we understand complex systems, being the most outstanding one the human brain. 
020       These networks have classically been reconstructed using a frequentist approach that, while simple, completely disregards the uncertainty that derives from data finiteness. We here provide an alternative solution based on Bayesian inference, with link weights treated as random variables described by probability distributions, from which ensembles of networks are sampled. By using both statistical and topological considerations, we prove that the role played by links' uncertainty is equivalent to the introduction of a random rewiring, whose omission leads to a consistent overestimation of topological structures. We further show that this bias is enhanced in short time series, suggesting the existence of a theoretical time resolution limit for obtaining reliable structures. We also propose a simple sampling process for correcting topological values obtained in frequentist networks. We finally validate these concepts through synthetic and real network examples, the latter representing the brain electrical activity of a group of people during a cognitive task.

010       Dealing with Unknown Unknowns: Identification and Selection of Minimal   Sensing for Fractional Dynamics with Unknown Inputs
021       This paper focuses on analysis and design of time-varying complex networks having fractional order dynamics. 
020       These systems are key in modeling the complex dynamical processes arising in several natural and man made systems. Notably, examples include neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) that captures the variation in potential fields, and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal, which serves as a proxy for neuronal activity. Notwithstanding, the complex networks originated by locally measuring EEG and BOLD are often treated as isolated networks and do not capture the dependency from external stimuli, e.g., originated in subcortical structures such as the thalamus and the brain stem. Therefore, we propose a paradigm-shift towards the analysis of such complex networks under unknown unknowns (i.e., excitations). Consequently, the main contributions of the present paper are threefold: (i) we present an alternating scheme that enables to determine the best estimate of the model parameters and unknown stimuli; (ii) we provide necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure that it is possible to retrieve the state and unknown stimuli; and (iii) upon these conditions we determine a small subset of variables that need to be measured to ensure that both state and input can be recovered, while establishing sub-optimality guarantees with respect to the smallest possible subset. Finally, we present several pedagogical examples of the main results using real data collected from an EEG wearable device.

010       Correlation and scaling behaviors of $PM_{2.5}$ concentration in China
021       Air pollution has become a major issue and caused widespread environmental and health problems. 
020       Aerosols or particulate matters are an important component of the atmosphere and can transport under complex meteorological conditions. Based on the data of $PM_{2.5}$ observations, we develop a network approach to study and quantify their spreading and diffusion patterns. We calculate cross-correlation functions of time lag between sites within different season. The probability distribution of correlation changes with season. It is found that the probability distributions in four seasons can be scaled into one scaling function with averages and standard deviations of correlation. This seasonal scaling behavior indicates there is the same mechanism behind correlations of $PM_{2.5}$ concentration in different seasons. Further, from weighted and directional degrees of complex network, different properties of $PM_{2.5}$ concentration are studied. The weighted degrees reveal the strongest correlations of $PM_{2.5}$ concentration in winter and in the North China plain. These directional degrees show net influences of $PM_{2.5}$ along Gobi and inner Mongolia, the North China plain, Central China, and Yangtze River Delta.

010       A complex network framework to model cognition: unveiling correlation   structures from connectivity
021       Several approaches to cognition and intelligence research rely on statistics-based models testing, namely factor analysis. 
020       In the present work we exploit the emerging dynamical systems perspective putting the focus on the role of the network topology underlying the relationships between cognitive processes. We go through a couple of models of distinct cognitive phenomena and yet find the conditions for them to be mathematically equivalent. We find a non-trivial attractor of the system that corresponds to the exact definition of a well-known network centrality and hence stress the interplay between the dynamics and the underlying network connectivity, showing that both of the two are relevant. The connectivity structure between cognitive processes is not known but yet it is not any. Regardless of the network considered, it is always possible to recover a positive manifold of correlations. However, we show that different network topologies lead to different plausible statistical models concerning correlations structure, ranging from one to multiple factors models and richer correlation structures.

010       Magnetic shocks and substructures excited by torsional Alfv\&#x27;en wave   interactions in merging expanding flux tubes
021       Vortex motions are frequently observed on the solar photosphere. 
020       These motions may play a key role in the transport of energy and momentum from the lower atmosphere into the upper solar atmosphere, contributing to coronal heating. The lower solar atmosphere also consists of complex networks of flux tubes that expand and merge throughout the chromosphere and upper atmosphere. We perform numerical simulations to investigate the behaviour of vortex driven waves propagating in a pair of such flux tubes in a non-force-free equilibrium with a realistically modelled solar atmosphere. The two flux tubes are independently perturbed at their footpoints by counter-rotating vortex motions. When the flux tubes merge, the vortex motions interact both linearly and nonlinearly. The linear interactions generate many small-scale transient magnetic substructures due to the magnetic stress imposed by the vortex motions. Thus, an initially monolithic tube is separated into a complex multi-threaded tube due to the photospheric vortex motions. The wave interactions also drive a superposition that increases in amplitude until it exceeds the local Mach number and produces shocks that propagate upwards with speeds of approximately $ 50$ km s$^{-1}$. The shocks act as conduits transporting momentum and energy upwards, and heating the local plasma by more than an order of magnitude, with peak temperature approximately $60,000$ K. Therefore, we present a new mechanism for the generation of magnetic waveguides from the lower solar atmosphere to the solar corona. This wave guide appears as the result of interacting perturbations in neighbouring flux tubes. Thus, the interactions of photospheric vortex motions is a potentially significant mechanism for energy transfer from the lower to upper solar atmosphere.

010       Recognizing number of communities and detecting community structures in   complex networks
021       Recognizing number of communities and detecting community structures of complex network are discussed in this paper. 
020       As a visual and feasible algorithm, block model has been successfully applied to detect community structures in complex network. In order to measure the quality of the block model, we first define an objective function WQ value. For obtaining block model B of a network, GSA algorithm is applied to optimize WQ with the help of random keys. After executing processes AO (Adding Ones) and RO (Removing Ones) on block model B, the number of communities of a network can be recognized distinctly. Furthermore, based on the advantage of block model that its sort order of nodes is in correspondence with sort order of communities, so a new fuzzy boundary algorithm for detecting community structures is proposed and successfully applied to some representative networks. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

010       A Machine Learning Approach for Power Allocation in HetNets Considering   QoS
021       There is an increase in usage of smaller cells or femtocells to improve performance and coverage of next-generation heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets). 
020       However, the interference caused by femtocells to neighboring cells is a limiting performance factor in dense HetNets. This interference is being managed via distributed resource allocation methods. However, as the density of the network increases so does the complexity of such resource allocation methods. Yet, unplanned deployment of femtocells requires an adaptable and self-organizing algorithm to make HetNets viable. As such, we propose to use a machine learning approach based on Q-learning to solve the resource allocation problem in such complex networks. By defining each base station as an agent, a cellular network is modelled as a multi-agent network. Subsequently, cooperative Q-learning can be applied as an efficient approach to manage the resources of a multi-agent network. Furthermore, the proposed approach considers the quality of service (QoS) for each user and fairness in the network. In comparison with prior work, the proposed approach can bring more than a four-fold increase in the number of supported femtocells while using cooperative Q-learning to reduce resource allocation overhead.

010       Analytical and numerical study of the non-linear noisy voter model on   complex networks
021       We study the noisy voter model using a specific non-linear dependence of the rates that takes into account collective interaction between individuals. 
020       The resulting model is solved exactly under the all-to-all coupling configuration and approximately in some random networks environments. In the all-to-all setup we find that the non-linear interactions induce "bona fide" phase transitions that, contrarily to the linear version of the model, survive in the thermodynamic limit. The main effect of the complex network is to shift the transition lines and modify the finite-size dependence, a modification that can be captured with the introduction of an effective system size that decreases with the degree heterogeneity of the network. A non-trivial finite-size dependence of the moments of the probability distribution is derived from our treatment, nevertheless mean-field exponents are obtained in the thermodynamic limit. These theoretical predictions are well confirmed by numerical simulations of the stochastic process.

010       Weighted Null-Space Fitting for Identification of Cascade Networks
021       For identification of systems embedded in dynamic networks, applying the prediction error method (PEM) to a correct tailor-made parametrization of the complete network provided asymptotically efficient estimates. 
020       However, the network complexity often hinders a successful application of PEM, which requires minimizing a non-convex cost function that in general becomes more difficult for more complex networks. For this reason, identification in dynamic networks often focuses in obtaining consistent estimates of particular network modules of interest. A downside of such approaches is that splitting the network in several modules for identification often costs asymptotic efficiency. In this paper, we consider the particular case of a dynamic network with the individual systems connected in a serial cascaded manner, with measurements affected by sensor noise. We propose an algorithm that estimates all the modules in the network simultaneously without requiring the minimization of a non-convex cost function. This algorithm is an extension of Weighted Null-Space Fitting (WNSF), a weighted least-squares method that provides asymptotically efficient estimates for single-input single-output systems. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with simulation studies, which suggest that a network WNSF may also be asymptotically efficient estimates when applied to cascade networks, and discuss the possibility of extension to more general networks affected by sensor noise.

010       Word sense induction using word embeddings and community detection in   complex networks
021       Word Sense Induction (WSI) is the ability to automatically induce word senses from corpora. 
020       The WSI task was first proposed to overcome the limitations of manually annotated corpus that are required in word sense disambiguation systems. Even though several works have been proposed to induce word senses, existing systems are still very limited in the sense that they make use of structured, domain-specific knowledge sources. In this paper, we devise a method that leverages recent findings in word embeddings research to generate context embeddings, which are embeddings containing information about the semantical context of a word. In order to induce senses, we modeled the set of ambiguous words as a complex network. In the generated network, two instances (nodes) are connected if the respective context embeddings are similar. Upon using well-established community detection methods to cluster the obtained context embeddings, we found that the proposed method yields excellent performance for the WSI task. Our method outperformed competing algorithms and baselines, in a completely unsupervised manner and without the need of any additional structured knowledge source.

010       A spectrum of routing strategies for brain networks
021       Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. 
020       Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally "cheap" but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines varying amounts of local and global information about the network topology. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying amounts of local and global information on the network's communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small amount of global information. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the amount of global information driving the system's dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, suggesting instead that brain networks may exhibit different types of communication dynamics depending on varying functional demands and the availability of resources.

010       Network archaeology: phase transition in the recoverability of network   history
021       Network growth processes can be understood as generative models of the structure and history of complex networks. 
020       This point of view naturally leads to the problem of network archaeology: Reconstructing all the past states of a network from its structure---a difficult permutation inference problem. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian formulation of network archaeology, with a generalization of preferential attachment as our generative mechanism. We develop a sequential importance sampling algorithm to evaluate the posterior averages of this model, as well as an efficient heuristic that uncovers the history of a network in linear time. We use these methods to identify and characterize a phase transition in the quality of the reconstructed history, when they are applied to artificial networks generated by the model itself. Despite the existence of a no-recovery phase, we find that non-trivial inference is possible in a large portion of the parameter space as well as on empirical data.

010       Re-thinking EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces: modeling and   analysis
021       Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. 
020       Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based \emph{a priori} knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples.

010       Universality of non-normality in real complex networks
021       Based on a detailed study involving a large set of empirical networks arising from a wide spectrum of research fields, we claim that strong non-normality is indeed a universal property in network science. 
020       Dynamical processes evolving on non-normal networks exhibit a peculiar behaviour, initial small disturbances can undergo a transient phase and be strongly amplified although the system is linearly stable. We hence propose several models to generate complex non-normal networks to explain the origin of such property. Because of the non-normality of the networked support, the comprehension of the dynamical properties goes beyond the classical linear spectral methods, while we show that the pseudo-spectrum is able to capture such behaviour. This response is very general and it challenges our understanding of natural processes grounded on real networks, as we illustrate in the Generalised Lotka-Volterra model.
