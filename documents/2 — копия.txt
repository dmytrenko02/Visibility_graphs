010       Error and attack tolerance of complex networks
021       Many complex systems, such as communication networks, display a surprising degree of robustness: while key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. 
020       The stability of these complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. In this paper we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems, but it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks. We find that scale-free networks, describing a number of systems, such as the World Wide Web, Internet, social networks or a cell, display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected by even unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price: these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks, i.e. to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play the most important role in assuring the network's connectivity.

010       The large-scale organization of metabolic networks
021       In a cell or microorganism the processes that generate mass, energy, information transfer, and cell fate specification are seamlessly integrated through a complex network of various cellular constituents and reactions. 
020       However, despite the key role these networks play in sustaining various cellular functions, their large-scale structure is essentially unknown. Here we present the first systematic comparative mathematical analysis of the metabolic networks of 43 organisms representing all three domains of life. We show that, despite significant variances in their individual constituents and pathways, these metabolic networks display the same topologic scaling properties demonstrating striking similarities to the inherent organization of complex non-biological systems. This suggests that the metabolic organization is not only identical for all living organisms, but complies with the design principles of robust and error-tolerant scale-free networks, and may represent a common blueprint for the large-scale organization of interactions among all cellular constituents.

010       Bose-Einstein condensation in complex networks
021       The evolution of many complex systems, including the world wide web, business and citation networks is encoded in the dynamic web describing the interactions between the system's constituents. 
020       Despite their irreversible and non-equilibrium nature these networks follow Bose statistics and can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Addressing the dynamical properties of these non-equilibrium systems within the framework of equilibrium quantum gases predicts that the 'first-mover-advantage', 'fit-get-rich' and 'winner-takes-all' phenomena observed in competitive systems are thermodynamically distinct phases of the underlying evolving networks.

010       Epidemic dynamics and endemic states in complex networks
021       We study by analytical methods and large scale simulations a dynamical model for the spreading of epidemics in complex networks. 
020       In networks with exponentially bounded connectivity we recover the usual epidemic behavior with a threshold defining a critical point below which the infection prevalence is null. On the contrary, on a wide range of scale-free networks we observe the absence of an epidemic threshold and its associated critical behavior. This implies that scale-free networks are prone to the spreading and the persistence of infections whatever spreading rate the epidemic agents might possess. These results can help understanding computer virus epidemics and other spreading phenomena on communication and social networks.

010       Spectra of "Real-World" Graphs: Beyond the Semi-Circle Law
021       Many natural and social systems develop complex networks, that are usually modelled as random graphs. 
020       The eigenvalue spectrum of these graphs provides information about their structural properties. While the semi-circle law is known to describe the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs, much less is known about the eigenvalues of real-world graphs, describing such complex systems as the Internet, metabolic pathways, networks of power stations, scientific collaborations or movie actors, which are inherently correlated and usually very sparse. An important limitation in addressing the spectra of these systems is that the numerical determination of the spectra for systems with more than a few thousand nodes is prohibitively time and memory consuming. Making use of recent advances in algorithms for spectral characterization, here we develop new methods to determine the eigenvalues of networks comparable in size to real systems, obtaining several surprising results on the spectra of adjacency matrices corresponding to models of real-world graphs. We find that when the number of links grows as the number of nodes, the spectral density of uncorrelated random graphs does not converge to the semi-circle law. Furthermore, the spectral densities of real-world graphs have specific features depending on the details of the corresponding models. In particular, scale-free graphs develop a triangle-like spectral density with a power law tail, while small-world graphs have a complex spectral density function consisting of several sharp peaks. These and further results indicate that the spectra of correlated graphs represent a practical tool for graph classification and can provide useful insight into the relevant structural properties of real networks.

010       A Price Dynamics in Bandwidth Markets for Point-to-point Connections
021       We simulate a network of N routers and M network users making concurrent point-to-point connections by buying and selling router capacity from each other. 
020       The resources need to be acquired in complete sets, but there is only one spot market for each router. In order to describe the internal dynamics of the market, we model the observed prices by N-dimensional Ito-processes. Modeling using stochastic processes is novel in this context of describing interactions between end-users in a system with shared resources, and allows a standard set of mathematical tools to be applied. The derived models can also be used to price contingent claims on network capacity and thus to price complex network services such as quality of service levels, multicast, etc.

010       Measuring preferential attachment for evolving networks
021       A key ingredient of current models proposed to capture the topological evolution of complex networks is the hypothesis that highly connected nodes increase their connectivity faster than their less connected peers, a phenomenon called preferential attachment. 
020       Measurements on four networks, namely the science citation network, Internet, actor collaboration and science coauthorship network indicate that the rate at which nodes acquire links depends on the node's degree, offering direct quantitative support for the presence of preferential attachment. We find that for the first two systems the attachment rate depends linearly on the node degree, while for the latter two the dependence follows a sublinear power law.

010       Topology, Hidden Spectra and Bose Einstein Condensation on low   dimensional complex networks
021       Topological inhomogeneity gives rise to spectral anomalies that can induce Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) in low dimensional systems. 
020       These anomalies consist in energy regions composed of an infinite number of states with vanishing weight in the thermodynamic limit (hidden states). Here we present a rigorous result giving the most general conditions for BEC on complex networks. We prove that the presence of hidden states in the lowest region of the spectrum is the necessary and sufficient condition for condensation in low dimension (spectral dimension $\bar{d}\leq 2$), while it is shown that BEC always occurs for $\bar{d}&gt;2$.

010       Topological Reduction of Tight-Binding Models on Complex Networks
021       Complex molecules and mesoscopic structures are naturally described by general networks of elementary building blocks and tight-binding is one of the simplest quantum model suitable for studying the physical properties arising from the network topology. 
020       Despite the simplicity of the model, topological complexity can make the evaluation of the spectrum of the tight-binding Hamiltonian a rather hard task, since the lack of translation invariance rules out such a powerful tool as Fourier transform. In this paper we introduce a rigorous analytical technique, based on topological methods, for the exact solution of this problem on branched structures. Besides its analytic power, this technique is also a promising engineering tool, helpful in the design of netwoks displaying the desired spectral features.

010       Language as an Evolving Word Web
021       Human language can be described as a complex network of linked words. 
020       In such a treatment, each distinct word in language is a vertex of this web, and neighboring words in sentences are connected by edges. It was recently found (Ferrer and Sol\'e) that the distribution of the numbers of connections of words in such a network is of a peculiar form which includes two pronounced power-law regions. Here we treat language as a self-organizing network of interacting words. In the framework of this concept, we completely describe the observed Word Web structure without fitting.

020       While traditionally these systems were modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real networks is governed by robust organizing principles. Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.

This test of strength for complex networks like Internet is more stringent than others recently considered like the random removal of nodes, analyzed within the framework of percolation theory. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our results and their relevance in forecasting cascading failures in scale-free networks.

010       Evolution of networks
021       We review the recent fast progress in statistical physics of evolving networks. 
020       Interest has focused mainly on the structural properties of random complex networks in communications, biology, social sciences and economics. A number of giant artificial networks of such a kind came into existence recently. This opens a wide field for the study of their topology, evolution, and complex processes occurring in them. Such networks possess a rich set of scaling properties. A number of them are scale-free and show striking resilience against random breakdowns. In spite of large sizes of these networks, the distances between most their vertices are short -- a feature known as the ``small-world'' effect. We discuss how growing networks self-organize into scale-free structures and the role of the mechanism of preferential linking. We consider the topological and structural properties of evolving networks, and percolation in these networks. We present a number of models demonstrating the main features of evolving networks and discuss current approaches for their simulation and analytical study. Applications of the general results to particular networks in Nature are discussed. We demonstrate the generic connections of the network growth processes with the general problems of non-equilibrium physics, econophysics, evolutionary biology, etc.

010       Immunization of complex networks
021       Complex networks such as the sexual partnership web or the Internet often show a high degree of redundancy and heterogeneity in their connectivity properties. 
020       This peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents. Here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks. Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks. In particular, targeted immunization schemes, based on the nodes' connectivity hierarchy, sharply lower the network's vulnerability to epidemic attacks.

010       Epidemic outbreaks in complex heterogeneous networks
021       We present a detailed analytical and numerical study for the spreading of infections in complex population networks with acquired immunity. 
020       We show that the large connectivity fluctuations usually found in these networks strengthen considerably the incidence of epidemic outbreaks. Scale-free networks, which are characterized by diverging connectivity fluctuations, exhibit the lack of an epidemic threshold and always show a finite fraction of infected individuals. This particular weakness, observed also in models without immunity, defines a new epidemiological framework characterized by a highly heterogeneous response of the system to the introduction of infected individuals with different connectivity. The understanding of epidemics in complex networks might deliver new insights in the spread of information and diseases in biological and technological networks that often appear to be characterized by complex heterogeneous architectures.

010       Small-World Effects in Wealth Distribution
021       We construct a model of wealth distribution, based on an interactive multiplicative stochastic process on static complex networks. 
020       Through numerical simulations we show that a decrease in the number of links discourages equality in wealth distribution, while the rewiring of links in small-world networks encourages it. Inequal distributions obey log-normal distributions, which are produced by wealth clustering. The rewiring of links breaks the wealth clustering and makes wealth obey the mean field type (power law) distributions. A mechanism that explains the appearance of log-normal distributions with a power law tail is proposed.

010       Power-Law Scaling for Communication Networks with Transmission Errors
021       A generic communication model of a boolean network with transmission errors is proposed to explore the power-law scaling of states' evolution in small-world networks. 
020       In the model, the power spectrum of the population difference between agents with "1" and "-1" exhibits a power-law tail: $P(f)\sim f^{-\alpha}$. The exponent $\alpha$ does not depend explicitly on the error rate but on the structure of the networks. Error rate enters only into the frequency scales and thus governs the frequency range over which these power laws can be observed. On the other hand, the exponent $\alpha$ reveals the intricate internal structure of networks and can serve as a structure factor to classify complex networks. The finite transmission error is shown to provide a mechanism for the common occurrence of the power-law relation in complex systems, such as financial markets and opinion formation.

010       Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Directed Small-World Networks
021       Many social, biological, and economic systems can be approached by complex networks of interacting units. 
020       The behaviour of several models on small-world networks has recently been studied. These models are expected to capture the essential features of the complex processes taking place on real networks like disease spreading, formation of public opinion, distribution of wealth, etc. In many of these systems relations are directed, in the sense that links only act in one direction (outwards or inwards). We investigate the effect of directed links on the behaviour of a simple spin-like model evolving on a small-world network. We show that directed networks may lead to a highly nontrivial phase diagram including first and second-order phase transitions out of equilibrium.

010       Optimization in complex networks
021       Many complex systems can be described in terms of networks of interacting units. 
020       Recent studies have shown that a wide class of both natural and artificial nets display a surprisingly widespread feature: the presence of highly heterogeneous distributions of links, providing an extraordinary source of robustness against perturbations. Although most theories concerning the origin of these topologies use growing graphs, here we show that a simple optimization process can also account for the observed regularities displayed by most complex nets. Using an evolutionary algorithm involving minimization of link density and average distance, four major types of networks are encountered: (a) sparse exponential-like networks, (b) sparse scale-free networks, (c) star networks and (d) highly dense networks, apparently defining three major phases. These constraints provide a new explanation for scaling of exponent about -3. The evolutionary consequences of these results are outlined.

010       Bose-Einstein Condensation on inhomogeneous complex networks
021       The thermodynamic properties of non interacting bosons on a complex network can be strongly affected by topological inhomogeneities. 
020       The latter give rise to anomalies in the density of states that can induce Bose-Einstein condensation in low dimensional systems also in absence of external confining potentials. The anomalies consist in energy regions composed of an infinite number of states with vanishing weight in the thermodynamic limit. We present a rigorous result providing the general conditions for the occurrence of Bose-Einstein condensation on complex networks in presence of anomalous spectral regions in the density of states. We present results on spectral properties for a wide class of graphs where the theorem applies. We study in detail an explicit geometrical realization, the comb lattice, which embodies all the relevant features of this effect and which can be experimentally implemented as an array of Josephson Junctions.

010       Attack vulnerability of complex networks
021       We study the response of complex networks subject to attacks on vertices and edges. 
020       Several existing complex network models as well as real-world networks of scientific collaborations and Internet traffic are numerically investigated, and the network performance is quantitatively measured by the average inverse geodesic length and the size of the largest connected subgraph. For each case of attacks on vertices and edges, four different attacking strategies are used: removals by the descending order of the degree and the betweenness centrality, calculated for either the initial network or the current network during the removal procedure. It is found that the removals by the recalculated degrees and betweenness centralities are often more harmful than the attack strategies based on the initial network, suggesting that the network structure changes as important vertices or edges are removed. Furthermore, the correlation between the betweenness centrality and the degree in complex networks is studied.

010       Economic Small-World Behavior in Weighted Networks
021       The small-world phenomenon has been already the subject of a huge variety of papers, showing its appeareance in a variety of systems. 
020       However, some big holes still remain to be filled, as the commonly adopted mathematical formulation suffers from a variety of limitations, that make it unsuitable to provide a general tool of analysis for real networks, and not just for mathematical (topological) abstractions. In this paper we show where the major problems arise, and how there is therefore the need for a new reformulation of the small-world concept. Together with an analysis of the variables involved, we then propose a new theory of small-world networks based on two leading concepts: efficiency and cost. Efficiency measures how well information propagates over the network, and cost measures how expensive it is to build a network. The combination of these factors leads us to introduce the concept of {\em economic small worlds}, that formalizes the idea of networks that are "cheap" to build, and nevertheless efficient in propagating information, both at global and local scale. This new concept is shown to overcome all the limitations proper of the so-far commonly adopted formulation, and to provide an adequate tool to quantitatively analyze the behaviour of complex networks in the real world. Various complex systems are analyzed, ranging from the realm of neural networks, to social sciences, to communication and transportation networks. In each case, economic small worlds are found. Moreover, using the economic small-world framework, the construction principles of these networks can be quantitatively analyzed and compared, giving good insights on how efficiency and economy principles combine up to shape all these systems.

010       Scale-free Networks from Optimal Design
021       A large number of complex networks, both natural and artificial, share the presence of highly heterogeneous, scale-free degree distributions. 
020       A few mechanisms for the emergence of such patterns have been suggested, optimization not being one of them. In this letter we present the first evidence for the emergence of scaling (and smallworldness) in software architecture graphs from a well-defined local optimization process. Although the rules that define the strategies involved in software engineering should lead to a tree-like structure, the final net is scale-free, perhaps reflecting the presence of conflicting constraints unavoidable in a multidimensional optimization process. The consequences for other complex networks are outlined.

010       Percolation in Directed Scale-Free Networks
021       Many complex networks in nature have directed links, a property that affects the network's navigability and large-scale topology. 
020       Here we study the percolation properties of such directed scale-free networks with correlated in- and out-degree distributions. We derive a phase diagram that indicates the existence of three regimes, determined by the values of the degree exponents. In the first regime we regain the known directed percolation mean field exponents. In contrast, the second and third regimes are characterized by anomalous exponents, which we calculate analytically. In the third regime the network is resilient to random dilution, i.e., the percolation threshold is p_c-&gt;1.

010       Classification of scale-free networks
021       While the emergence of a power law degree distribution in complex networks is intriguing, the degree exponent is not universal. 
020       Here we show that the betweenness centrality displays a power-law distribution with an exponent \eta which is robust and use it to classify the scale-free networks. We have observed two universality classes with \eta \approx 2.2(1) and 2.0, respectively. Real world networks for the former are the protein interaction networks, the metabolic networks for eukaryotes and bacteria, and the co-authorship network, and those for the latter one are the Internet, the world-wide web, and the metabolic networks for archaea. Distinct features of the mass-distance relation, generic topology of geodesics and resilience under attack of the two classes are identified. Various model networks also belong to either of the two classes while their degree exponents are tunable.

010       Pattern Detection in Complex Networks: Correlation Profile of the   Internet
021       A general scheme for detecting and analyzing topological patterns in large complex networks is presented. 
020       In this scheme the network in question is compared with its properly randomized version that preserves some of its low-level topological properties. Statistically significant deviation of any measurable property of a network from this null model likely reflect its design principles and/or evolutionary history. We illustrate this basic scheme on the example of the correlation profile of the Internet quantifying correlations between connectivities of its neighboring nodes. This profile distinguishes the Internet from previously studied molecular networks with a similar scale-free connectivity distribution. We finally demonstrate that clustering in a network is very sensitive to both the connectivity distribution and its correlation profile and compare the clustering in the Internet to the appropriate null model.

010       Efficiency of Scale-Free Networks: Error and Attack Tolerance
021       The concept of network efficiency, recently proposed to characterize the properties of small-world networks, is here used to study the effects of errors and attacks on scale-free networks. 
020       Two different kinds of scale-free networks, i.e. networks with power law P(k), are considered: 1) scale-free networks with no local clustering produced by the Barabasi-Albert model and 2) scale-free networks with high clustering properties as in the model by Klemm and Eguiluz, and their properties are compared to the properties of random graphs (exponential graphs). By using as mathematical measures the global and the local efficiency we investigate the effects of errors and attacks both on the global and the local properties of the network. We show that the global efficiency is a better measure than the characteristic path length to describe the response of complex networks to external factors. We find that, at variance with random graphs, scale-free networks display, both on a global and on a local scale, a high degree of error tolerance and an extreme vulnerability to attacks. In fact, the global and the local efficiency are unaffected by the failure of some randomly chosen nodes, though they are extremely sensititive to the removal of the few nodes which play a crucial role in maintaining the network's connectivity.

010       Epidemic spreading in correlated complex networks
021       We study a dynamical model of epidemic spreading on complex networks in which there are explicit correlations among the node's connectivities. 
020       For the case of Markovian complex networks, showing only correlations between pairs of nodes, we find an epidemic threshold inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of the connectivity matrix that gives the average number of links that from a node with connectivity $k$ go to nodes with connectivity $k'$. Numerical simulations on a correlated growing network model provide support for our conclusions.
